# AIME2025 Benchmark Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented the AIME2025 benchmark for evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of language models. The benchmark is based on the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) 2025 problems.

## Files Created

### Core Implementation
- `evaluation/AIME2025/create_huggingface_dataset.py` - Dataset processing and standardization
- `evaluation/AIME2025/calculate_metrics.py` - Metrics calculation and answer extraction
- `evaluation/AIME2025/__init__.py` - Module initialization
- `evaluation/AIME2025/README.md` - Comprehensive documentation

### Testing and Validation
- `evaluation/AIME2025/test_aime2025.py` - Complete test suite
- `evaluation/AIME2025/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

### Integration
- Modified `evaluation/evaluate.py` to include AIME2025 benchmark

## Key Features

### Dataset Processing
- Converts raw AIME2025 dataset from HuggingFace (`yentinglin/aime_2025`) to standardized format
- 30 mathematical competition problems
- Clear instructions for models to use `\boxed{...}` format
- Generous token limits (4096 tokens) for comprehensive step-by-step solutions

### Answer Extraction
Robust multi-level extraction system:
1. **Primary**: Extract from `\boxed{...}` format (standard mathematical notation)
2. **Fallback 1**: Pattern matching for "answer is X" or "answer: X"
3. **Fallback 2**: Numbers at the end of responses
4. **Fallback 3**: Any valid AIME-range number (0-999)

### Metrics
- **Exact Match**: Primary evaluation metric (percentage of correct answers)
- **Extraction Rate**: Percentage of responses with extractable answers
- **Boxed Format Rate**: Percentage using the required `\boxed{...}` format
- **Error Analysis**: Breakdown of error types

### Validation
- Range validation (AIME answers are 0-999)
- Format compliance checking
- Comprehensive test suite with 100% pass rate

## Integration Details

### Dataset Dictionary
```python
"aime2025": "yentinglin/aime_2025"
```

### Scorer Dictionary
```python
"aime2025": aime2025_scorer
```

### Special Handling
Added custom dataset processing logic in `evaluate.py` since AIME2025 uses "train" split and requires format conversion.

## Usage

### Command Line
```bash
python evaluation/evaluate.py --dataset aime2025 --base_model meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
```

### Programmatic
```python
from evaluation.evaluate import evaluate

evaluate(
    dataset="aime2025",
    base_model="meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
    max_new_tokens=4096
)
```

## Testing Results

All tests pass successfully:
- ✓ Dataset creation (30 examples)
- ✓ Answer extraction (10/10 test cases)
- ✓ Metrics calculation (exact match, extraction rate, boxed format rate)
- ✓ Integration with main evaluation system

## Expected Performance

AIME problems are challenging mathematical competition problems. Expected characteristics:
- Lower accuracy compared to simpler math benchmarks
- Significant variation based on model mathematical reasoning capabilities
- Importance of both correctness and format compliance
- Emphasis on multi-step reasoning and mathematical insight

## Technical Notes

### Answer Format Requirements
Models must wrap final answers in `\boxed{...}` format:
```
Let me solve this step by step.

[Mathematical reasoning]

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{42}.
```

### Range Validation
All answers must be integers between 0 and 999 (AIME format requirement).

### Robustness
The implementation handles various edge cases:
- Missing boxed format (fallback extraction)
- Out-of-range answers (filtered out)
- Multiple numbers in response (takes last valid one)
- No extractable answer (counted as error)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Add support for partial credit based on mathematical reasoning quality
2. Implement solution path analysis
3. Add difficulty-based stratified evaluation
4. Include problem category classification (algebra, geometry, etc.)

## Compliance

- Follows existing benchmark patterns in the repository
- Uses standard evaluation pipeline
- Maintains consistent code style and documentation
- Includes comprehensive error handling and validation
