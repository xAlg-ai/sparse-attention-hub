"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nThis report provides background information and issues for Congress on multiyear procurement (MYP) and block buy contracting (BBC), which are special contracting mechanisms that Congress permits the Department of Defense (DOD) to use for a limited number of defense acquisition programs. Compared to the standard or default approach of annual contracting, MYP and BBC have the potential for reducing weapon procurement costs by a few or several percent. Potential issues for Congress concerning MYP and BBC include whether to use MYP and BBC in the future more frequently, less frequently, or about as frequently as they are currently used; whether to create a permanent statute to govern the use of BBC, analogous to the permanent statute that governs the use of MYP; and whether the Coast Guard should begin making use of MYP and BBC. Congress's decisions on these issues could affect defense acquisition practices, defense funding requirements, and the defense industrial base. A contract that the Air Force has for the procurement of Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Launch Services (ELS) has sometimes been referred to as a block buy, but it is not an example of block buy contracting as discussed in this report. The Air Force in this instance is using the term block buy to mean something different. This report does not discuss the ELS contract. (For additional discussion, see "" Terminology Alert: Block Buy Contracting vs. Block Buys "" below.) In discussing MYP, BBC, and incremental funding, it can be helpful to distinguish contracting mechanisms from funding approaches. The two are often mixed together in discussions of DOD acquisition, sometimes leading to confusion. Stated briefly Funding approaches are ways that Congress can appropriate funding for weapon procurement programs, so that DOD can then put them under contract. Examples of funding approaches include traditional full funding (the standard or default approach), incremental funding, and advance appropriations. Any of these funding approaches might make use of advance procurement (AP) funding. Contracting mechanisms are ways for DOD to contract for the procurement of weapons systems, once funding for those systems has been appropriated by Congress. Examples of contracting mechanisms include annual contracting (the standard or default DOD approach), MYP, and BBC. Contracting mechanisms can materially change the total procurement cost of a ship. The use of a particular funding approach in a defense acquisition program does not dictate the use of a particular contracting mechanism. Defense acquisition programs consequently can be implemented using various combinations of funding approaches and contracting mechanisms. Most DOD weapon acquisition programs use a combination of traditional full funding and annual contracting. A few programs, particularly certain Navy shipbuilding programs, use incremental funding as their funding approach. A limited number of DOD programs use MYP as their contracting approach, and to date three Navy shipbuilding programs have used BBC as their contracting approach. The situation is summarized in Table 1 . This report focuses on the contracting approaches of MYP and BBC and how they compare to annual contracting. Other CRS reports discuss the funding approaches of traditional full funding, incremental funding, and advance appropriations. What is MYP, and how does it differ from annual contracting? MYP, also known as multiyear contracting, is an alternative to the standard or default DOD approach of annual contracting. Under annual contracting, DOD uses one or more contracts for each year's worth of procurement of a given kind of item. Under MYP, DOD instead uses a single contract for two to five years' worth of procurement of a given kind of item, without having to exercise a contract option for each year after the first year. DOD needs congressional approval for each use of MYP. To illustrate the basic difference between MYP and annual contracting, consider a hypothetical DOD program to procure 20 single-engine aircraft of a certain kind over the 5-year period FY2018-FY2022, at a rate of 4 aircraft per year: Under annual contracting , DOD would issue one or more contracts for each year's procurement of four aircraft. After Congress funds the procurement of the first four aircraft in FY2018, DOD would issue one or more contracts (or exercise a contract option) for those four aircraft. The next year, after Congress funds the procurement of the next four aircraft in FY2019, DOD would issue one or more contracts (or exercise a contract option) for those four aircraft, and so on. Under MYP , DOD would issue one contract covering all 20 aircraft to be procured during the 5-year period FY2018-FY2022. DOD would award this contract in FY2018, at the beginning of the five-year period, following congressional approval to use MYP for the program, and congressional appropriation of the FY2018 funding for the program. To continue the implementation of the contract over the next four years, DOD would request the FY2019 funding for the program as part of DOD's proposed FY2019 budget, the FY2020 funding as part of DOD's proposed FY2020 budget, and so on. How much can MYP save? Compared with estimated costs under annual contracting, estimated savings for programs being proposed for MYP have ranged from less than 5% to more than 15%, depending on the particulars of the program in question, with many estimates falling in the range of 5% to 10%. In practice, actual savings from using MYP rather than annual contracting can be difficult to observe or verify because of cost growth during the execution of the contract that was caused by developments independent of the use of MYP rather than annual contracting. A February 2012 briefing by the Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) office within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) states that ""MYP savings analysis is difficult due to the lack of actual costs on the alternative acquisition path, i.e., the path not taken."" The briefing states that CAPE up to that point had assessed MYP savings for four aircraft procurement programs—F/A-18E/F strike fighters, H-60 helicopters, V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft, and CH-47F helicopters—and that CAPE's assessed savings ranged from 2% to 8%. A 2008 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report stated that DOD does not have a formal mechanism for tracking multiyear results against original expectations and makes few efforts to validate whether actual savings were achieved by multiyear procurement. It does not maintain comprehensive central records and historical information that could be used to enhance oversight and knowledge about multiyear performance to inform and improve future multiyear procurement (MYP) candidates. DOD and defense research centers officials said it is difficult to assess results because of the lack of historical information on multiyear contracts, comparable annual costs, and the dynamic acquisition environment. How does MYP potentially save money? Compared to annual contracting, using MYP can in principle reduce the cost of the weapons being procured in two primary ways: Contractor optimization of workforce and production facilities . An MYP contract gives the contractor (e.g., an airplane manufacturer or shipbuilder) confidence that a multiyear stream of business of a known volume will very likely materialize. This confidence can permit the contractor to make investments in the firm's workforce and production facilities that are intended to optimize the facility for the production of the items being procured under the contract. Such investments can include payments for retaining or training workers, or for building, expanding, or modernizing production facilities. Under annual contracting, the manufacturer might not have enough confidence about its future stream of business to make these kinds of investments, or might be unable to convince its parent firm to finance them. E conomic order quan tity (EOQ) purchases of selected long-leadtime components. Under an MYP contract, DOD is permitted to bring forward selected key components of the items to be procured under the contract and to purchase the components in batch form during the first year or two of the contract. In the hypothetical example introduced earlier, using MYP could permit DOD to purchase, say, the 20 engines for the 20 aircraft in the first year or two of the 5-year contract. Procuring selected components in this manner under an MYP contract is called an economic order quantity (EOQ) purchase. EOQ purchases can reduce the procurement cost of the weapons being procured under the MYP contract by allowing the manufacturers of components to take maximum advantage of production economies of scale that are possible with batch orders. What gives the contractor confidence that the multiyear stream of business will materialize? At least two things give the contractor confidence that DOD will not terminate an MYP contract and that the multiyear stream of business consequently will materialize: For a program to qualify for MYP, DOD must certify, among other things, that the minimum need for the items to be purchased is expected to remain substantially unchanged during the contract in terms of production rate, procurement rate, and total quantities. Perhaps more important to the contractor, MYP contracts include a cancellation penalty intended to reimburse a contractor for costs that the contractor has incurred (i.e., investments the contractor has made) in anticipation of the work covered under the MYP contract. The undesirability of paying a cancellation penalty acts as a disincentive for the government against canceling the contract. (And if the contract is canceled, the cancellation penalty helps to make the contractor whole.) Is there a permanent statute governing MYP contracting? There is a permanent statute governing MYP contracting—10 U.S.C. 2306b. The statute was created by Section 909 of the FY1982 Department of Defense Authorization Act ( S. 815 / P.L. 97-86 of December 1, 1981), revised and reorganized by Section 1022 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 ( S. 1587 / P.L. 103-355 of October 13, 1994), and further amended on several occasions since. For the text of 10 U.S.C. 2306b, see Appendix A . DOD's use of MYP contracting is further governed by DOD acquisition regulations. Under this statute, what criteria must a program meet to qualify for MYP? 10 U.S.C. 2306b(a) states that to qualify for MYP, a program must meet several criteria, including the following: Significant savings. DOD must estimate that using an MYP contract would result in ""significant savings"" compared with using annual contracting. Realistic cost estimates . DOD's estimates of the cost of the MYP contract and the anticipated savings must be realistic. Stable need for the items. DOD must expect that its minimum need for the items will remain substantially unchanged during the contract in terms of production rate, procurement rate, and total quantities. Stable design for the items . The design for the items to be acquired must be stable, and the technical risks associated with the items must not be excessive. 10 U.S.C. includes provisions requiring the Secretary of Defense or certain other DOD officials to find, determine, or certify that these and other statutory requirements for using MYP contracts have been met, and provisions requiring the heads of DOD agencies to provide written notifications of certain things to the congressional defense committees 30 days before awarding or initiating an MYP contract, or 10 days before terminating one. 10 U.S.C. 2306b also requires DOD MYP contracts to be fixed-price type contracts. What is meant by "" significant savings""? The amount of savings required under 10 U.S.C. 2306b to qualify for using an MYP contract has changed over time; the requirement was changed from ""substantial savings"" to ""significant savings"" by Section 811 of the FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act ( S. 1356 / P.L. 114-92 of November 25, 2015). The joint explanatory statement for the FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act states the following regarding Section 811: Amendment relating to multiyear contract authority for acquisition of property (sec. 811) The House bill contained a provision (sec. 806) that would strike the existing requirement that the head of an agency must determine that substantial savings would be achieved before entering into a multiyear contract. The Senate amendment contained no similar provision. The Senate recedes with an amendment that would require that significant savings would be achieved before entering into a multiyear contract. The conferees agree that the government should seek to maximize savings whenever it pursues multiyear procurement. However, the conferees also agree that significant savings (estimated to be greater than $250.0 million), and other benefits, may be achieved even if it does not equate to a minimum of 10 percent savings over the cost of an annual contract. The conferees expect a request for authority to enter into a multiyear contract will include (1) the estimated cost savings, (2) the minimum quantity needed, (3) confirmation that the design is stable and the technical risks are not excessive, and (4) any other rationale for entering into such a contract. In addition, 10 U.S.C. 2306b states the following: If for any fiscal year a multiyear contract to be entered into under this section is authorized by law for a particular procurement program and that authorization is subject to certain conditions established by law (including a condition as to cost savings to be achieved under the multiyear contract in comparison to specified other contracts) and if it appears (after negotiations with contractors) that such savings cannot be achieved, but that significant savings could nevertheless be achieved through the use of a multiyear contract rather than specified other contracts, the President may submit to Congress a request for relief from the specified cost savings that must be achieved through multiyear contracting for that program. Any such request by the President shall include details about the request for a multiyear contract, including details about the negotiated contract terms and conditions. What is meant by ""stable design""? The term ""stable design"" is generally understood to mean that the design for the items to be procured is not expected to change substantially during the period of the contract. Having a stable design is generally demonstrated by having already built at least a few items to that design (or in the case of a shipbuilding program, at least one ship to that design) and concluding, through testing and operation of those items, that the design does not require any substantial changes during the period of the contract. What happens if Congress does not provide the annual funding requested by DOD to continue the implementation of the contract? If Congress does not provide the funding requested by DOD to continue the implementation of an MYP contract, DOD would be required to renegotiate, suspend, or terminate the contract. Terminating the contract could require the government to pay a cancellation penalty to the contractor. Renegotiating or suspending the contract could also have a financial impact. What effect does using MYP have on flexibility for making procurement changes? A principal potential disadvantage of using MYP is that it can reduce Congress's and DOD's flexibility for making changes (especially reductions) in procurement programs in future years in response to changing strategic or budgetary circumstances, at least without incurring cancellation penalties. In general, the greater the portion of DOD's procurement account that is executed under MYP contracts, the greater the potential loss of flexibility. The use of MYP for executing some portion of the DOD procurement account means that if policymakers in future years decide to reduce procurement spending below previously planned levels, the spending reduction might fall more heavily on procurement programs that do not use MYP, which in turn might result in a less-than-optimally balanced DOD procurement effort. How does Congress approve the use of MYP? Congress approves the use of MYP on a case-by-case basis, typically in response to requests by DOD. Congressional approval for DOD MYP contracts with a value of more than $500 million must occur in two places: an annual DOD appropriations act and an act other than the annual DOD appropriations act. In annual DOD appropriations acts, the provision permitting the use of MYP for one or more defense acquisition programs is typically included in the title containing general provisions, which typically is Title VIII. As shown in Table B-2 , since FY2011, it has been Section 8010. An annual national defense authorization act (NDAA) is usually the act other than an appropriations act in which provisions granting authority for using MYP contracting on individual defense acquisition programs are included. Such provisions typically occur in Title I of the NDAA, the title covering procurement programs. Provisions in which Congress approves the use of MYP for a particular defense acquisition program may include specific conditions for that program in addition to the requirements and conditions of 10 U.S.C. 2306b. How often is MYP used? MYP is used for a limited number of DOD acquisition programs. As shown in the Appendix B , annual DOD appropriations acts since FY1990 typically have approved the use of MYP for zero to a few DOD programs each year. An August 28, 2017, press report states the following: The Pentagon's portfolio of active multiyear procurement contracts is on track to taper from $10.7 billion in fiscal year 2017—or more than 8 percent of DOD procurement spending—to $1.2 billion by FY-19, according to data recently compiled by the Pentagon comptroller for lawmakers. However, there are potential new block-buy deals in the works, including several large Navy deals. According to the Multiyear Procurement Contracts Report for FY-17, which includes data current as of June 27, seven major defense acquisition programs are being purchased through multiyear procurement contracts, collectively obligating the U.S. government to spend $16 billion across the five-year spending plan with $14.5 billion of the commitments lashed to FY-17 and FY-18. In an interview published on January 13, 2014, Sean Stackley, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development, and Acquisition (i.e., the Navy's acquisition executive), stated the following: What the industrial base clamors for is stability, so they can plan, invest, train their work force. It gives them the ability in working with say, the Street [Wall Street], to better predict their own performance, then meet expectations in the same fashion we try to meet our expectations with the Hill. It's emblematic of stability that we've got more multiyear programs in the Department of the Navy than the rest of the Department of Defense combined. We've been able to harvest from that significant savings, and that has been key to solving some of our budget problems. It's allowed us in certain cases to put the savings right back into other programs tied to requirements. A February 2012 briefing by the Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) office within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) shows that the total dollar value of DOD MYP contracts has remained more or less stable between FY2000 and FY2012 at roughly $7 billion to $13 billion per year. The briefing shows that since the total size of DOD's procurement budget has increased during this period, the portion of DOD's total procurement budget accounted for by programs using MYP contracts has declined from about 17% in FY2000 to less than 8% in FY2012. The briefing also shows that the Navy makes more use of MYP contracts than does the Army or Air Force, and that the Air Force made very little use of MYP in FY2010-FY2012. A 2008 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report stated the following: Although DOD had been entering into multiyear contracts on a limited basis prior to the 1980s, the Department of Defense Authorization Act, [for fiscal year] 1982, codified the authority for DOD to procure on a multiyear basis major weapon systems that meet certain criteria. Since that time, DOD has annually submitted various weapon systems as multiyear procurement candidates for congressional authorization. Over the past 25 years, Congress has authorized the use of multiyear procurement for approximately 140 acquisition programs, including some systems approved more than once. What is BBC, and how does it compare to MYP? BBC is similar to MYP in that it permits DOD to use a single contract for more than one year's worth of procurement of a given kind of item without having to exercise a contract option for each year after the first year. BBC is also similar to MYP in that DOD needs congressional approval for each use of BBC. BBC differs from MYP in the following ways: There is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC. There is no requirement that BBC be approved in both a DOD appropriations act and an act other than a DOD appropriations act. Programs being considered for BBC do not need to meet any legal criteria to qualify for BBC because there is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC that establishes such criteria. A BBC contract can cover more than five years of planned procurements. The BBC contracts that were used by the Navy for procuring Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs), for example, covered a period of seven years (FY2010-FY2016). Economic order quantity (EOQ) authority does not come automatically as part of BBC authority because there is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC that includes EOQ authority as an automatic feature. To provide EOQ authority as part of a BBC contract, the provision granting authority for using BBC in a program may need to state explicitly that the authority to use BBC includes the authority to use EOQ. BBC contracts are less likely to include cancellation penalties. Given the one key similarity between BBC and MYP (the use of a single contract for more than one year's worth of procurement), and the various differences between BBC and MYP, BBC might be thought of as a less formal stepchild of MYP. When and why was BBC invented? BBC was invented by Section 121(b) of the FY1998 National Defense Authorization Act ( H.R. 1119 / P.L. 105-85 of November 18, 1997), which granted the Navy the authority to use a single contract for the procurement of the first four Virginia (SSN-774) class attack submarines. The 4 boats were scheduled to be procured during the 5-year period FY1998-FY2002 in annual quantities of 1-1-0-1-1. Congress provided the authority granted in Section 121(b) at least in part to reduce the combined procurement cost of the four submarines. Using MYP was not an option for the Virginia-class program at that time because the Navy had not even begun, let alone finished, construction of the first Virginia-class submarine, and consequently could not demonstrate that it had a stable design for the program. When Section 121(b) was enacted, there was no name for the contracting authority it provided. The term block buy contracting came into use later, when observers needed a term to refer to the kind of contracting authority that Congress authorized in Section 121(b). As discussed in the next section, this can cause confusion, because the term block buy was already being used in discussions of DOD acquisition to refer to something else. What's the difference between block buy cont r acting and block buys? In discussions of defense procurement, the term ""block buy"" by itself (without ""contracting"" at the end) is sometimes used to refer to something quite different from block buy contracting—namely, the simple act of funding the procurement of more than one copy of an item in a single year, particularly when no more than one item of that kind might normally be funded in a single year. For example, when Congress funded the procurement of two aircraft carriers in FY1983, and another two in FY1988, these acts were each referred to as block buys, because aircraft carriers are normally procured one at a time, several years apart from one another. This alternate meaning of the term block buy predates by many years the emergence of the term block buy contracting. The term block buy is still used in this alternate manner, which can lead to confusion in discussions of defense procurement. For example, for FY2017, the Air Force requested funding for procuring five Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles (EELVs) for its EELV Launch Services (ELS) program. At the same time, Navy officials sometimes refer to the use of block buy contracts for the first four Virginia-class submarines, and in the LCS program, as block buys, when they might be more specifically referred to as instances of block buy contract ing . How much can BBC save, compared with MYP? BBC can reduce the unit procurement costs of ships by amounts less than or perhaps comparable to those of MYP, if the authority granted for using BBC explicitly includes authority for making economic order quantity (EOQ) purchases of components. If the authority granted for using BBC does not explicitly include authority for making EOQ purchases, then the savings from BBC will be less. Potential savings under BBC might also be less than those under MYP if the BBC contract does not include a cancellation penalty, or includes one that is more limited than typically found in an MYP contract, because this might give the contractor less confidence than would be the case under an MYP contract that the future stream of business will materialize as planned, which in turn might reduce the amount of money the contractor invests to optimize its workforce and production facilities for producing the items to be procured under the contract. How frequently has BBC been used? Since its use at the start of the Virginia-class program, BBC has been used very rarely. The Navy did not use it again in a shipbuilding program until December 2010, when it awarded two block buy contracts, each covering 10 LCSs to be procured over the six-year period FY2010-FY2015, to the two LCS builders. (Each contract was later amended to include an 11 th ship in FY2016, making for a total of 22 ships under the two contracts.) A third example is the John Lewis (TAO-205) class oiler program, in which the Navy is using a block buy contract to procure the first six ships in the program. A fourth example, arguably, is the Air Force's KC-46 aerial refueling tanker program, which is employing a fixed price incentive fee (FPIF) development contract that includes a ""back end"" commitment to procure certain minimum numbers of KC-46s in certain fiscal years. When might BBC be suitable as an alternative to MYP? BBC might be particularly suitable as an alternative to MYP in cases where using a multiyear contract can reduce costs, but the program in question cannot meet all the statutory criteria needed to qualify for MYP. As shown in the case of the first four Virginia-class boats, this can occur at or near the start of a procurement program, when design stability has not been demonstrated through the production of at least a few of the items to be procured (or, for a shipbuilding program, at least one ship). What i s the difference between an MYP or block buy contract and a contract with options? The military services sometimes use contracts with options to procure multiple copies of an item that are procured over a period of several years. The Navy, for example, used a contract with options to procure Lewis and Clark (TAKE-1) class dry cargo ships that were procured over a period of several years. A contract with options can be viewed as somewhat similar to an MYP or block buy contract in that a single contract is used to procure several years' worth of procurement of a given kind of item. There is, however, a key difference between an MYP or block buy contract and a contract with options: In a contract with options, the service is under no obligation to exercise any of the options, and a service can choose to not exercise an option without having to make a penalty payment to the contractor. In contrast, in an MYP or block buy contract, the service is under an obligation to continue implementing the contract beyond the first year, provided that Congress appropriates the necessary funds. If the service chooses to terminate an MYP or block buy contract, and does so as a termination for government convenience rather than as a termination for contractor default, then the contractor can, under the contract's termination for convenience clause, seek a payment from the government for cost incurred for work that is complete or in process at the time of termination, and may include the cost of some of the investments made in anticipation of the MYP or block buy contract being fully implemented. The contractor can do this even if the MYP or block buy contract does not elsewhere include a provision for a cancellation penalty. As a result of this key difference, although a contract with options looks like a multiyear contract, it operates more like a series of annual contracts, and it cannot achieve the kinds of savings that are possible under MYP and BBC. Potential issues for Congress concerning MYP and BBC include whether to use MYP and BBC in the future more frequently, less frequently, or about as frequently as they are currently used; and whether to create a permanent statute to govern the use of BBC, analogous to the permanent statute that governs the use of MYP. Should MYP and BBC in the future be used more frequently, less frequently, or about as frequently as they are currently used? Supporters of using MYP and BBC more frequently in the future might argue the following: Since MYP and BBC can reduce procurement costs, making greater use of MYP and BBC can help DOD get more value out of its available procurement funding. This can be particularly important if DOD's budget in real (i.e., inflation-adjusted) terms remains flat or declines in coming years, as many observers anticipate. The risks of using MYP have been reduced by Section 811 of the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act ( H.R. 4986 / P.L. 110-181 of January 28, 2008), which amended 10 U.S.C. 2306b to strengthen the process for ensuring that programs proposed for MYP meet certain criteria (see "" Permanent Statute Governing MYP ""). Since the value of MYP contracts equated to less than 8% of DOD's procurement budget in FY2012, compared to about 17% of DOD's procurement budget in FY2000, MYP likely could be used more frequently without exceeding past experience regarding the share of DOD's procurement budget accounted for by MYP contracts. Supporters of using MYP and BBC less frequently in the future, or at least no more frequently than now, might argue the following: Using MYP and BBC more frequently would further reduce Congress's and DOD's flexibility for making changes in DOD procurement programs in future years in response to changing strategic or budgetary circumstances. The risks of reducing flexibility in this regard are increased now because of uncertainties in the current strategic environment and because efforts to reduce federal budget deficits could include reducing DOD spending, which could lead to a reassessment of U.S. defense strategy and associated DOD acquisition programs. Since actual savings from using MYP and BBC rather than annual contracting can be difficult to observe or verify, it is not clear that the financial benefits of using MYP or BBC more frequently in the future would be worth the resulting further reduction in Congress's and DOD's flexibility for making changes in procurement programs in future years in response to changing strategic or budgetary circumstances. Should Congress create a permanent statute to govern the use of BBC, analogous to the permanent statute (10 U.S.C. 2306b) that governs the use of MYP? Supporters of creating a permanent statute to govern the use of BBC might argue the following: Such a statute could encourage greater use of BBC, and thereby increase savings in DOD procurement programs by giving BBC contracting a formal legal standing and by establishing a clear process for DOD program managers to use in assessing whether their programs might be considered suitable for BBC. Such a statute could make BBC more advantageous by including a provision that automatically grants EOQ authority to programs using BBC, as well as provisions establishing qualifying criteria and other conditions intended to reduce the risks of using BBC. Opponents of creating a permanent statute to govern the use of BBC might argue the following: A key advantage of BBC is that it is not governed by a permanent statute. The lack of such a statute gives DOD and Congress full flexibility in determining when and how to use BBC for programs that may not qualify for MYP, but for which a multiyear contract of some kind might produce substantial savings. Such a statute could encourage DOD program managers to pursue their programs using BBC rather than MYP. This could reduce discipline in DOD multiyear contracting if the qualifying criteria in the BBC statute are less demanding than the qualifying criteria in 10 U.S.C. 2306b. Should the Coast Guard should begin making use of MYP and BBC? Although the Coast Guard is part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Coast Guard is a military service and a branch of the U.S. Armed Forces at all times (14 U.S.C. 1), and 10 U.S.C. 2306b provides authority for using MYP not only to DOD, but also to the Coast Guard (and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as well). In addition, Section 311 of the Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018 ( S. 140 / P.L. 115-282 of December 4, 2018) provides permanent authority for the Coast Guard to use block buy contracting with EOQ purchases of components in its major acquisition programs. The authority is now codified at 14 U.S.C. 1137. As discussed earlier in this report, the Navy in recent years has made extensive use of MYP and BBC in its ship and aircraft acquisition programs, reducing the collective costs of those programs, the Navy estimates, by billions of dollars. The Coast Guard, like the Navy, procures ships and aircraft. In contrast to the Navy, however, the Coast Guard has never used MYP or BBC in its ship or aircraft acquisition programs. Instead, the Coast has tended to use contracts with options. As discussed earlier, although a contract with options looks like a multiyear contract, it operates more like a series of annual contracts, and it cannot achieve the kinds of savings that are possible under MYP and BBC. CRS in recent years has testified and reported on the possibility of using BBC or MYP in Coast Guard ship acquisition programs, particularly the Coast Guard's 25-ship Offshore Patrol Cutter (OPC) program and the Coast Guard's three-ship polar icebreaker program. CRS estimates that using multiyear contracting rather than contracts with options for the entire 25-ship OPC program could reduce the cost of the OPC program by about $1 billion. The OPC program is the Coast Guard's top-priority acquisition program, and it represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reduce the acquisition cost of a Coast Guard acquisition program by an estimated $1 billion. CRS also estimates that using BBC for a three-ship polar icebreaker program could reduce the cost of that program by upwards of $150 million. The Coast Guard has expressed some interest in using BBC in the polar icebreaker program, but its baseline acquisition strategy for that program, like its current acquisition strategy for the OPC program, is to use a contract with options. As part of its FY2020 budget submission, the Department of Defense is proposing continued funding for implementing several MYP contracts initiated in fiscal years prior to FY2020, but it has not highlighted any requests for authority for new MYP or block buy contracts for major acquisition programs that would begin in FY2020. Appendix A. Text of 10 U.S.C. 2306b The text of 10 U.S.C. 2306b as of April 29, 2019, is as follows: §2306b. Multiyear contracts: acquisition of property (a) In General.-To the extent that funds are otherwise available for obligation, the head of an agency may enter into multiyear contracts for the purchase of property whenever the head of that agency finds each of the following: (1) That the use of such a contract will result in significant savings of the total anticipated costs of carrying out the program through annual contracts. (2) That the minimum need for the property to be purchased is expected to remain substantially unchanged during the contemplated contract period in terms of production rate, procurement rate, and total quantities. (3) That there is a reasonable expectation that throughout the contemplated contract period the head of the agency will request funding for the contract at the level required to avoid contract cancellation. (4) That there is a stable design for the property to be acquired and that the technical risks associated with such property are not excessive. (5) That the estimates of both the cost of the contract and the anticipated cost avoidance through the use of a multiyear contract are realistic. (6) In the case of a purchase by the Department of Defense, that the use of such a contract will promote the national security of the United States. (7) In the case of a contract in an amount equal to or greater than $500,000,000, that the conditions required by subparagraphs (C) through (F) of subsection (i)(3) will be met, in accordance with the Secretary's certification and determination under such subsection, by such contract. (b) Regulations.-(1) Each official named in paragraph (2) shall prescribe acquisition regulations for the agency or agencies under the jurisdiction of such official to promote the use of multiyear contracting as authorized by subsection (a) in a manner that will allow the most efficient use of multiyear contracting. (2)(A) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe the regulations applicable to the Department of Defense. (B) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall prescribe the regulations applicable to the Coast Guard, except that the regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense shall apply to the Coast Guard when it is operating as a service in the Navy. (C) The Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shall prescribe the regulations applicable to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. (c) Contract Cancellations.-The regulations may provide for cancellation provisions in multiyear contracts to the extent that such provisions are necessary and in the best interests of the United States. The cancellation provisions may include consideration of both recurring and nonrecurring costs of the contractor associated with the production of the items to be delivered under the contract. (d) Participation by Subcontractors, Vendors, and Suppliers.-In order to broaden the defense industrial base, the regulations shall provide that, to the extent practicable- (1) multiyear contracting under subsection (a) shall be used in such a manner as to seek, retain, and promote the use under such contracts of companies that are subcontractors, vendors, or suppliers; and (2) upon accrual of any payment or other benefit under such a multiyear contract to any subcontractor, vendor, or supplier company participating in such contract, such payment or benefit shall be delivered to such company in the most expeditious manner practicable. (e) Protection of Existing Authority.-The regulations shall provide that, to the extent practicable, the administration of this section, and of the regulations prescribed under this section, shall not be carried out in a manner to preclude or curtail the existing ability of an agency- (1) to provide for competition in the production of items to be delivered under such a contract; or (2) to provide for termination of a prime contract the performance of which is deficient with respect to cost, quality, or schedule. (f) Cancellation or Termination for Insufficient Funding.-In the event funds are not made available for the continuation of a contract made under this section into a subsequent fiscal year, the contract shall be canceled or terminated. The costs of cancellation or termination may be paid from- (1) appropriations originally available for the performance of the contract concerned; (2) appropriations currently available for procurement of the type of property concerned, and not otherwise obligated; or (3) funds appropriated for those payments. (g) Contract Cancellation Ceilings Exceeding $100,000,000.-(1) Before any contract described in subsection (a) that contains a clause setting forth a cancellation ceiling in excess of $100,000,000 may be awarded, the head of the agency concerned shall give written notification of the proposed contract and of the proposed cancellation ceiling for that contract to the congressional defense committees, and such contract may not then be awarded until the end of a period of 30 days beginning on the date of such notification. (2) In the case of a contract described in subsection (a) with a cancellation ceiling described in paragraph (1), if the budget for the contract does not include proposed funding for the costs of contract cancellation up to the cancellation ceiling established in the contract, the head of the agency concerned shall, as part of the certification required by subsection (i)(1)(A),1 give written notification to the congressional defense committees of- (A) the cancellation ceiling amounts planned for each program year in the proposed multiyear procurement contract, together with the reasons for the amounts planned; (B) the extent to which costs of contract cancellation are not included in the budget for the contract; and (C) a financial risk assessment of not including budgeting for costs of contract cancellation. (h) Defense Acquisitions of Weapon Systems.-In the case of the Department of Defense, the authority under subsection (a) includes authority to enter into the following multiyear contracts in accordance with this section: (1) A multiyear contract for the purchase of a weapon system, items and services associated with a weapon system, and logistics support for a weapon system. (2) A multiyear contract for advance procurement of components, parts, and materials necessary to the manufacture of a weapon system, including a multiyear contract for such advance procurement that is entered into in order to achieve economic-lot purchases and more efficient production rates. (i) Defense Acquisitions Specifically Authorized by Law.-(1) In the case of the Department of Defense, a multiyear contract in an amount equal to or greater than $500,000,000 may not be entered into under this section unless the contract is specifically authorized by law in an Act other than an appropriations Act. (2) In submitting a request for a specific authorization by law to carry out a defense acquisition program using multiyear contract authority under this section, the Secretary of Defense shall include in the request the following: (A) A report containing preliminary findings of the agency head required in paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (a), together with the basis for such findings. (B) Confirmation that the preliminary findings of the agency head under subparagraph (A) were supported by a preliminary cost analysis performed by the Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation. (3) A multiyear contract may not be entered into under this section for a defense acquisition program that has been specifically authorized by law to be carried out using multiyear contract authority unless the Secretary of Defense certifies in writing, not later than 30 days before entry into the contract, that each of the following conditions is satisfied: (A) The Secretary has determined that each of the requirements in paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (a) will be met by such contract and has provided the basis for such determination to the congressional defense committees. (B) The Secretary's determination under subparagraph (A) was made after completion of a cost analysis conducted on the basis of section 2334(e)(2) 1 of this title, and the analysis supports the determination. (C) The system being acquired pursuant to such contract has not been determined to have experienced cost growth in excess of the critical cost growth threshold pursuant to section 2433(d) of this title within 5 years prior to the date the Secretary anticipates such contract (or a contract for advance procurement entered into consistent with the authorization for such contract) will be awarded. (D) A sufficient number of end items of the system being acquired under such contract have been delivered at or within the most current estimates of the program acquisition unit cost or procurement unit cost for such system to determine that current estimates of such unit costs are realistic. (E) During the fiscal year in which such contract is to be awarded, sufficient funds will be available to perform the contract in such fiscal year, and the future-years defense program for such fiscal year will include the funding required to execute the program without cancellation. (F) The contract is a fixed price type contract. (G) The proposed multiyear contract provides for production at not less than minimum economic rates given the existing tooling and facilities. (4) If for any fiscal year a multiyear contract to be entered into under this section is authorized by law for a particular procurement program and that authorization is subject to certain conditions established by law (including a condition as to cost savings to be achieved under the multiyear contract in comparison to specified other contracts) and if it appears (after negotiations with contractors) that such savings cannot be achieved, but that significant savings could nevertheless be achieved through the use of a multiyear contract rather than specified other contracts, the President may submit to Congress a request for relief from the specified cost savings that must be achieved through multiyear contracting for that program. Any such request by the President shall include details about the request for a multiyear contract, including details about the negotiated contract terms and conditions. (5)(A) The Secretary may obligate funds for procurement of an end item under a multiyear contract for the purchase of property only for procurement of a complete and usable end item. (B) The Secretary may obligate funds appropriated for any fiscal year for advance procurement under a contract for the purchase of property only for the procurement of those long-lead items necessary in order to meet a planned delivery schedule for complete major end items that are programmed under the contract to be acquired with funds appropriated for a subsequent fiscal year (including an economic order quantity of such long-lead items when authorized by law). (6) The Secretary may make the certification under paragraph (3) notwithstanding the fact that one or more of the conditions of such certification are not met, if the Secretary determines that, due to exceptional circumstances, proceeding with a multiyear contract under this section is in the best interest of the Department of Defense and the Secretary provides the basis for such determination with the certification. (7) The Secretary may not delegate the authority to make the certification under paragraph (3) or the determination under paragraph (6) to an official below the level of Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. (j) Defense Contract Options for Varying Quantities.-The Secretary of Defense may instruct the Secretary of the military department concerned to incorporate into a proposed multiyear contract negotiated priced options for varying the quantities of end items to be procured over the period of the contract. (k) Multiyear Contract Defined.-For the purposes of this section, a multiyear contract is a contract for the purchase of property for more than one, but not more than five, program years. Such a contract may provide that performance under the contract during the second and subsequent years of the contract is contingent upon the appropriation of funds and (if it does so provide) may provide for a cancellation payment to be made to the contractor if such appropriations are not made. (l) Various Additional Requirements With Respect to Multiyear Defense Contracts.-(1)(A) The head of an agency may not initiate a contract described in subparagraph (B) unless the congressional defense committees are notified of the proposed contract at least 30 days in advance of the award of the proposed contract. (B) Subparagraph (A) applies to the following contracts: (i) A multiyear contract- (I) that employs economic order quantity procurement in excess of $20,000,000 in any one year of the contract; or (II) that includes an unfunded contingent liability in excess of $20,000,000. (ii) Any contract for advance procurement leading to a multiyear contract that employs economic order quantity procurement in excess of $20,000,000 in any one year. (2) The head of an agency may not initiate a multiyear contract for which the economic order quantity advance procurement is not funded at least to the limits of the Government's liability. (3) The head of an agency may not initiate a multiyear procurement contract for any system (or component thereof) if the value of the multiyear contract would exceed $500,000,000 unless authority for the contract is specifically provided in an appropriations Act. (4) Each report required by paragraph (5) with respect to a contract (or contract extension) shall contain the following: (A) The amount of total obligational authority under the contract (or contract extension) and the percentage that such amount represents of- (i) the applicable procurement account; and (ii) the agency procurement total. (B) The amount of total obligational authority under all multiyear procurements of the agency concerned (determined without regard to the amount of the multiyear contract (or contract extension)) under multiyear contracts in effect at the time the report is submitted and the percentage that such amount represents of- (i) the applicable procurement account; and (ii) the agency procurement total. (C) The amount equal to the sum of the amounts under subparagraphs (A) and (B), and the percentage that such amount represents of- (i) the applicable procurement account; and (ii) the agency procurement total. (D) The amount of total obligational authority under all Department of Defense multiyear procurements (determined without regard to the amount of the multiyear contract (or contract extension)), including any multiyear contract (or contract extension) that has been authorized by the Congress but not yet entered into, and the percentage that such amount represents of the procurement accounts of the Department of Defense treated in the aggregate. (5) The head of an agency may not enter into a multiyear contract (or extend an existing multiyear contract), the value of which would exceed $500,000,000 (when entered into or when extended, as the case may be), until the Secretary of Defense submits to the congressional defense committees a report containing the information described in paragraph (4) with respect to the contract (or contract extension). (6) The head of an agency may not terminate a multiyear procurement contract until 10 days after the date on which notice of the proposed termination is provided to the congressional defense committees. (7) The execution of multiyear contracting authority shall require the use of a present value analysis to determine lowest cost compared to an annual procurement. (8) This subsection does not apply to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration or to the Coast Guard. (9) In this subsection: (A) The term ""applicable procurement account"" means, with respect to a multiyear procurement contract (or contract extension), the appropriation account from which payments to execute the contract will be made. (B) The term ""agency procurement total"" means the procurement accounts of the agency entering into a multiyear procurement contract (or contract extension) treated in the aggregate. (m) Increased Funding and Reprogramming Requests.-Any request for increased funding for the procurement of a major system under a multiyear contract authorized under this section shall be accompanied by an explanation of how the request for increased funding affects the determinations made by the Secretary under subsection (i). Appendix B. Programs Approved for MYP in Annual DOD Appropriations Acts Since FY1990 This appendix presents, in two tables, programs approved for MYP in annual DOD appropriations acts since FY1990. Table B-1 covers FY2011 to the present, and Table B-2 covers FY1990 through FY2010.\n\n","[""Multiyear procurement (MYP) and block buy contracting (BBC) are special contracting mechanisms that Congress permits the Department of Defense (DOD) to use for a limited number of defense acquisition programs. Compared to the standard or default approach of annual contracting, MYP and BBC have the potential for reducing weapon procurement costs by a few or several percent. Under annual contracting, DOD uses one or more contracts for each year's worth of procurement of a given kind of item. Under MYP, DOD instead uses a single contract for two to five years' worth of procurement of a given kind of item without having to exercise a contract option for each year after the first year. DOD needs congressional approval for each use of MYP. There is a permanent statute governing MYP contracting—10 U.S.C. 2306b. Under this statute, a program must meet several criteria to qualify for MYP. Compared with estimated costs under annual contracting, estimated savings for programs being proposed for MYP have ranged from less than 5% to more than 15%, depending on the particulars of the program in question, with many estimates falling in the range of 5% to 10%. In practice, actual savings from using MYP rather than annual contracting can be difficult to observe or verify because of cost growth during the execution of the contract due to changes in the program independent of the use of MYP rather than annual contracting. BBC is similar to MYP in that it permits DOD to use a single contract for more than one year's worth of procurement of a given kind of item without having to exercise a contract option for each year after the first year. BBC is also similar to MYP in that DOD needs congressional approval for each use of BBC. BBC differs from MYP in the following ways: There is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC. There is no requirement that BBC be approved in both a DOD appropriations act and an act other than a DOD appropriations act. Programs being considered for BBC do not need to meet any legal criteria to qualify for BBC, because there is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC that establishes such criteria. A BBC contract can cover more than five years of planned procurements. Economic order quantity (EOQ) authority—the authority to bring forward selected key components of the items to be procured under the contract and purchase the components in batch form during the first year or two of the contract—does not come automatically as part of BBC authority because there is no permanent statute governing the use of BBC that includes EOQ authority as an automatic feature. BBC contracts are less likely to include cancellation penalties. Potential issues for Congress concerning MYP and BBC include whether to use MYP and BBC in the future more frequently, less frequently, or about as frequently as they are currently used; whether to create a permanent statute to govern the use of BBC, analogous to the permanent statute that governs the use of MYP; and whether the Coast Guard should begin making use of MYP and BBC.""]","8537","gov_report","en","None","4bd6930b3b65caf89aa127d679a80294f31f9cfa7cdab703","Summary:","gov_report","532","\n\nThis report provides a comprehensive overview of multi-year procation contracting (MYP) and block buy contracting (BBC) mechan"
"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nThe inventories of the selected Air Force and Navy fixed-wing aircraft in our review totaled 2,823 aircraft and required approximately $20 billion to operate and support in fiscal year 2016. The inventory, aircraft status, initial operational capability, and service life forecast for each of the 12 selected fixed-wing aircraft are shown in figure 1. Sustainment of fixed-wing aircraft and other weapon systems comprises the logistics and personnel services required to maintain and prolong operations, and DOD policy provides direction to service components on sustainment planning across the life cycle of the weapon system. Specifically, DOD policy requires the services to develop and implement a sustainment strategy, such as a Life-cycle Sustainment Plan, for sustaining its weapon systems. According to DOD’s policy, this strategy should be the basis for all sustainment efforts, including sustainment metrics mapped to key performance parameters and key system attributes, such as aircraft availability, to manage sustainment performance. The policy states that, after initial operating capability, programs should update the sustainment plan whenever there are major changes to its strategy for sustaining the weapon system, or every 5 years, whichever occurs first. The Air Force and the Navy also have guidance that implements the requirements of the DOD guidance. These services’ guidance include sustainment-planning requirements for life-cycle sustainment and assurance of affordability. There are a variety of DOD offices that have roles and responsibilities related to sustaining fixed-wing aircraft. For instance, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (USD ), is the principal staff assistant and advisor to the Secretary of Defense for all matters concerning acquisition and sustainment. Specifically, USD (A&S) is responsible for establishing policies for logistics, maintenance, and sustainment support for all elements of DOD, including fixed-wing aircraft. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Logistics and Materiel Readiness (ASD ) serves as the principal staff assistant and advisor to the USD (A&S) on logistics and materiel readiness within DOD. Specifically, the ASD (L&MR) is responsible for (1) establishing DOD policies and procedures for logistics, maintenance, materiel readiness, strategic mobility, and sustainment support; (2) providing related guidance to the Secretaries of the military departments, including developing the Life- cycle Sustainment Plan outline; and (3) monitoring and reviewing programs associated with these areas, among other duties and responsibilities. For the Air Force, the Air Force Materiel Command develops, acquires, and sustains weapon systems through research, development, testing, evaluation, acquisition, maintenance, and program management of the systems and their components. This command provides acquisition and life-cycle management services and logistics support, among other things. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center within the Air Force Materiel Command is responsible for the life-cycle management of weapon systems from inception to retirement. A Program Executive Officer—responsible for managing a specific portfolio of weapon systems—is responsible for each of the selected fixed-wing aircraft. The Program Executive Officer oversees the program office that manages each weapon system. For the Navy and Marine Corps, the Naval Air Systems Command is responsible for providing the full life-cycle support of naval aviation aircraft, weapons, and systems. This support includes research, design, development and systems engineering; acquisition; test and evaluation; training facilities and equipment; repair and modification; and in-service engineering and logistics support. As with the Air Force, Program Executive Officers oversee their assigned program managers. DOD relies on program managers to lead the development, delivery, and sustainment of individual weapon systems through their life cycles. The program managers are the designated individuals with responsibility for and authority to accomplish the program’s sustainment objectives to meet the users’ operational needs. Product support managers, who work within the program offices, are responsible for developing and implementing support strategies for weapon systems that maintain readiness and control life-cycle costs. Weapon systems are sustained under various arrangements that may include contractors, DOD organic facilities, or some combination of the two. For example, the Air Force Sustainment Center provides depot maintenance through its Air Logistics Complexes for weapon systems. Naval Air Systems Command is responsible for the Navy Fleet Readiness Centers, which provide depot-level maintenance for Navy and Marine Corps fixed-wing aircraft. Additionally, the Air Force Sustainment Center and the Navy Supply Systems Command, as well as the Defense Logistics Agency, manage inventories of repair parts, and individual weapon systems programs are typically supported by a complex supplier network that includes a prime contractor, subcontractors, and various tiers of parts suppliers. On the other hand, sustainment responsibilities—in their entirety or particular elements—may be contracted out as part of a public-private partnership or a performance-based logistics agreement, such as with the F-22 Raptor. The Air Force and Navy monitor the readiness status of selected fixed- wing aircraft through numerous performance metrics. Specifically, the Air Force measures how well a fleet is performing by calculating the availability of the fleets’ aircraft, which is the number of aircraft that are available for flight operations. The Navy measures its aircraft availability through two metrics: (1) Ready-Basic-Aircraft (RBA)—the number of aircraft that are able to safely fly—and (2) Ready-for-Tasking (RFT)—the number of aircraft that are able to conduct specific missions. Both the Air Force and Navy have established goals associated with aircraft availability. In addition to measuring the availability of the aircraft against the associated goals, the Air Force and Navy track the reasons for aircraft not being available or able to conduct missions. Specifically, the Air Force and Navy track the following: Aircraft in depot: Aircraft unavailable to conduct missions because of scheduled or unscheduled depot maintenance or modification. Not mission capable maintenance: Aircraft that are not in depot and not capable of performing any of their assigned missions because of maintenance. Not mission capable supply: Aircraft that are not in depot and not capable of performing any of their assigned missions because of the lack of a repair part. In addition to these three metrics, the Air Force also tracks the following: Not mission capable for both supply and maintenance: Aircraft that are not in depot and not capable of performing any of their assigned missions because of both maintenance and the lack of a repair part. Units possessed not reported: Aircraft that are not available for use for reasons other than depot and not mission capable status, but possessed by the squadron. There are various costs associated with operating and supporting weapon systems. DOD’s Operating and Support Cost-Estimating Guide provides direction to the service components on developing estimates to support various analyses and reviews throughout the program life cycle. According to the guide, as a program matures, it remains necessary to continue to track and assess O&S costs and trends to ensure that the program remains sustainable, affordable, and properly funded. Each military department maintains a database that collects historical data on the O&S costs for major fielded weapon systems. DOD’s Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation provides policy guidance on this requirement, known as the Visibility and Management of Operating and Support Costs program; specifies the common format in which the data are to be reported; and monitors its implementation by each of the military departments. O&S costs are categorized using the following six overarching elements: unit level manpower—cost of operators, maintainers, and other support manpower assigned to operating units; unit operations—cost of unit operating materiel such as fuel, and training material, unit support services, and unit travel; maintenance—cost of system maintenance including depot- and sustaining support—cost of system support activities that are provided by organizations other than the system’s operating units; continuing system improvements—cost of system hardware and software modifications; and indirect support—cost of activities that provide general services that lack the visibility of actual support to specific force units or systems. For the selected Air Force and Navy fixed-wing aircraft in our review, aircraft availability and O&S cost trends varied over the 6-year period between fiscal years 2011 and 2016, and the aircraft generally did not meet availability goals. We found that 6 of 12 fixed-wing aircraft—3 from each service—experienced decreased aircraft availability between fiscal years 2011 and 2016. One aircraft met availability goals each year between fiscal year 2011 and 2016. Conversely, six aircraft met the goals in some years but not others, and five aircraft did not meet the goals in any year. In the latest year included in our review—fiscal year 2016—9 of 12 of the fixed-wing aircraft did not meet their associated availability goals. With respect to O&S costs, the overall O&S total for all 12 aircraft was about $20 billion annually over the 6-year period; some aircraft experienced increases while the costs to operate and support others decreased. The reasons for changes in costs included increases in maintenance costs for 8 of 12 fixed-wing aircraft. Below we summarize these trends, and the “Sustainment Quick Looks” in appendices II–XIII provide detailed information on the trends associated with each of the 12 fixed-wing aircraft and appendix XV provides additional information on operating and support cost per aircraft. Our analysis found that: between fiscal years 2011 and 2016, aircraft availability for two of five selected Air Force fixed-wing aircraft fluctuated and for three decreased; between fiscal 2011 and 2016, two aircraft met availability goals in some years, and three aircraft did not meet availability goals in any of the years; and in fiscal year 2016, four of the five aircraft did not meet availability goals. Specific details regarding aircraft availability and not mission capable status for maintenance, supply, and both maintenance and supply were omitted because DOD deemed this information as sensitive (i.e., For Official Use Only). According to officials, when aircraft availability goals are not met, training and operational missions may not be fulfilled as timely as needed. For example, F-22 squadron officials explained that the lack of available aircraft creates a shortage of trained pilots. F-22 pilots need extensive training to fulfill their air-superiority role. Further, command officials explained that when aircraft availability goals are not met, there may not be enough aircraft to respond to contingency requirements. Officials expressed concern that, given the capability and expectation of the F-22 to be available to create air superiority in any operation, missions may not be met. Additionally, E-8C program office officials stated that missions are often limited to top priority, which means supported combatant commands may not obtain all needed capabilities, such as the E-8C not being able to provide surveillance capability to particular combatant commands. From fiscal years 2011 through 2016, O&S costs for the Air Force aircraft in our review totaled about $13 billion annually. These costs decreased for the C-17, F-16, and the F-22, but increased for the B-52 and E-8C, as shown in figure 2. For example, the F-16’s total annual O&S costs decreased by about $943 million (or about 19 percent) because of decreases in all cost elements—the largest decrease being unit operations—except sustaining support. According to officials, the decrease in unit operations can be attributed to the retiring of aircraft and the consolidation of squadrons. The C-17’s and F-22’s O&S costs decreased mainly because of decreases in two cost elements: continuing system improvements and unit operations. In contrast, the B-52’s and the E-8C’s O&S costs increased, by $76 million (or about 6 percent) and $41 million (or about 6 percent), respectively. The increases occurred because two of the cost elements—continuing system improvements and maintenance costs—increased more than the other costs elements decreased. Based on our analysis of the O&S cost elements, maintenance cost generally is one of the largest portions—on average about 36 percent—of total O&S costs for each aircraft. As shown in figure 3, maintenance costs for four of the five aircraft generally have increased from fiscal years 2011 through 2016. Specifically, maintenance costs for the C-17, E-8C, and F- 22 increased because of additional depot maintenance needs. B-52 maintenance costs fluctuated year to year, but increased overall during this period. The overall maintenance costs for the F-16 decreased by approximately $140 million. According to our analysis, even though there was an increase in some of the F-16 maintenance cost elements, the fleet’s executed flying hours decreased. Therefore, the flying hour depot- level reparable costs decreased by approximately $123 million and engine repair decreased by $115 million, causing the overall maintenance cost to decrease. Our analysis found that: between fiscal years 2011 and 2016, aircraft availability increased for three of the seven Navy fixed-wing aircraft, fluctuated for one, and decreased for the remaining three aircraft; between fiscal 2011 and 2016, one aircraft met aircraft availability goals in each year, and four aircraft met goals in some years, while two aircraft did not meet goals in any of the years; and in fiscal year 2016, the Navy did not meet aircraft availability goals for five of the seven aircraft. Specific details regarding aircraft availability and not mission capable status for maintenance and supply were omitted because DOD deemed this information as sensitive (i.e., For Official Use Only). To address decreases in aircraft availability, the Navy has moved available aircraft between squadrons to help ensure deploying squadrons are fully equipped for their assigned missions. In November 2017, the Commander of Naval Air Forces testified before the House Armed Services Committee that to equip the air wings with the required number of mission capable aircraft for the deployment of three aircraft carriers in 2017, the Navy had to transfer 94 strike fighters to and from the maintenance depots or between squadrons. This transfer included pulling aircraft from fleet replacement squadrons, where the focus should be on training new aviators. The Commander of Naval Air Forces, in his November 2017 testimony, summarized the issue: “That strike fighter inventory management, or shell game, leaves non-deployed squadrons well below the number of jets required to keep aviators proficient and progressing toward their career qualifications and milestones, with detrimental impacts to both retention and future experience levels.” Furthermore, based on our analysis, F/A- 18A-D squadrons have underexecuted their flight hours by an average of 4 percent from fiscal years 2011 through 2016. According to officials, this is largely due to low aircraft availability. Additionally, placing further strain on aircraft availability, the F/A-18A-D inventory has decreased from 581 aircraft in fiscal year 2011 to 537 aircraft in fiscal year 2016. From fiscal years 2011 through 2016, O&S costs for the Navy’s seven selected fixed-wing aircraft totaled about $7 billion annually. Also, the Navy has experienced varying O&S and maintenance costs since fiscal year 2011 for these aircraft. Specifically, annual O&S costs decreased for the AV-8B, C-2A, E-2C, and F/A-18A-D, and increased for the E-2D, EA- 18G, and F/A-18E-F, as shown in figure 4. We found that O&S costs for the F/A-18A-D decreased by about 22 percent from about $3.1 billion in fiscal year 2011 to about $2.4 billion in fiscal year 2016. According to officials, this decrease can be attributed to the decrease in inventory as aircraft are retired and squadrons transition to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. In another example, O&S costs for the E- 2D increased from about $1.6 million in fiscal year 2012 to about $125 million in fiscal year 2016. The size of the fleet has increased by 17 aircraft—from 3 to 20 since fiscal year 2011. According to officials, this aircraft remains in production with a projected fleet size of 75; as inventory increases, so will O&S costs. Based on our analysis of the O&S cost elements, maintenance cost generally is one of the largest portions—about 42 percent—of total O&S costs for the seven aircraft in our review. Annual maintenance costs have increased for the C-2A, E-2D, EA-18G, and F/A-18E-F, and decreased for the AV-8B, E-2C, and F/A-18A-D, as shown in figure 5. We found that maintenance cost for the C-2A increased by about 7 percent from about $89 million in fiscal year 2011 to about $95 million in fiscal year 2016. According to officials, the increase in maintenance cost can be attributed to increased demand for outer wing panels, which resulted in a $16 million increase in depot-level repair costs and a more than 10 percent increase in executed flight hours, among other things. In another example, maintenance cost for the AV-8B decreased by about 9 percent from about $375 million in fiscal year 2011 to about $341 million in fiscal year 2016. According to officials, these decreases can be attributed to the AV-8B no longer being used in Operation Enduring Freedom in 2012, the loss of six aircraft, and the transition of AV-8B squadrons to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The Air Force and Navy face similar sustainment challenges that relate to aging, maintenance, and supply support that affect aircraft availability and O&S costs for the 12 aircraft selected in our review, as shown in figure 6. Specifically, 10 of 12 aircraft are experiencing sustainment challenges related to aging; all 12 are experiencing challenges related to maintenance; and all 12 are also experiencing challenges related to supply support. Below is a brief overview of these challenges: Aging: A number of these aircraft are aging and operating beyond their planned service life, partly because of delays in replacement aircraft. Specifically, the Air Force and Navy plan to replace the F-16, AV-8B, and F/A-18A-D with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The Navy is expected to transition the F/A-18A-D through 2030 and the Marine Corps is planning to use the F/A-18A-D beyond 2030 (although these time frames have been extended several times already). The Navy plans to retire the AV-8B in 2026. On the other hand, the Air Force is not expected to retire the F-16 until at least 2040. Because of aging, according to officials, there are parts on some aircraft that need to be repaired and replaced that were not accounted for during initial sustainment analysis. To mitigate some challenges associated with the age of the fixed-wing aircraft, the Air Force and Navy program officials have decided to extend the service life of some aircraft by repairing and overhauling airframes and components, as well as developing the engineering specifications for parts that were never planned to be repaired or replaced. Maintenance: Delays in getting aircraft into and through depot maintenance, as well as shortages of skilled maintainers, are contributing to some aircraft missing their availability goals. Both services reported losing experienced maintainers, either to retirement or to other programs such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. To address maintenance challenges, program offices for the selected aircraft have improved the efficiency and speed of depot maintenance, as well as are working to ensure there are sufficient numbers of trained maintainers. Supply Support: Some aircraft are encountering supply shortages as a result of parts not being available, in some cases due to obsolescence issues or diminishing manufacturer sources. Overcoming part shortages through either searching for replacement parts or reengineering parts takes time, which can contribute to aircraft being unavailable for longer periods. To mitigate supply challenges, officials have proactively upgraded aircraft before obsolescence occurs or located available parts and reengineered parts that are no longer in production, as well as identified suitable manufacturers in advance, among other things. For more specific information on sustainment challenges related to aging aircraft, maintenance, and supply support for each of the fixed-wing aircraft, see the “Sustainment Quick Looks” in appendixes II–XIII. The Air Force has documented sustainment strategies for its five selected aircraft in our review, but the Navy has not documented sustainment strategies or updated the strategies for four of seven of its aircraft in our review. The Air Force and Navy also regularly reviewed sustainment metrics and have implemented plans to improve aircraft availability. The Air Force has documented sustainment strategies for the five selected fixed-wing aircraft and updated them in accordance with Air Force guidance. However, the Navy has not documented a sustainment strategy or updated the strategies for four of the seven aircraft in our review since 2012. See figure 7 for the year of the most recent update to the sustainment strategy for the aircraft in our review. While sustainment strategies do not guarantee successful outcomes, they serve as a tool to guide operations as well as support planning and implementation of activities through the life-cycle of the aircraft. Specifically, at a high-level the strategy is aimed at integrating requirements, product support elements, funding, and risk management to provide oversight of the aircraft. For example, these sustainment strategies can be documented in a life-cycle sustainment plan, postproduction support plan, or an in-service support plan, among other types of documented strategies. Additionally, program officials stated that an aircraft’s sustainment strategy is an important management tool for the sustainment of the aircraft by documenting requirements that are known by all stakeholders, including good practices identified in sustaining each aircraft. For example: The strategy for the Air Force B-52 has been updated several times in recent years because of several major modifications. For example, in 2014 the Air Force issued an updated sustainment plan within the life- cycle management plan to update the combat network communications technology program because the B-52’s communications system is still the original from the 1950s and has limitations related to making mission or target changes in flight. The plan addresses the testing, resource management, and numerous program performance indicators and requirements of the system. The strategy for the Air Force F-16 outlines plans for the aircraft’s service life extension and includes proactive measures and data forecasting to bundle depot modifications in order to minimize fleet- wide effects on aircraft availability. The service life extension for the F- 16 is designed to extend the service life of 300 F-16 aircraft from 8,000 to 13,856 flight hours at an estimated cost of $740 million (as of June 2016). The strategy for the Navy E-2D provides a systematic approach to ensure that a comprehensive support package is in place to support the sustainment of the aircraft. Also, it describes the overall plan for the management and execution of the product support package by communicating the sustainment strategy to stakeholders in the acquisition, engineering, and logistics communities. However, the Navy had not documented a sustainment strategy for the C- 2A because a strategy was not required when the aircraft, now a legacy system, was going through the acquisition process prior to 1965. According to Navy officials, while they have not documented a strategy for the C-2A, they are undertaking efforts, such as updating technical publications, performing maintenance analysis on the landing gear, and evaluating depot tasks to decrease turnaround time, among other efforts, to sustain the aircraft. However, a documented sustainment strategy for the C-2A would help guide the planning and implementation of these efforts, as well as serve as a management tool by documenting these requirements that are known by all stakeholders. In addition, the Navy’s sustainment strategies for the E-2C (2011), EA- 18G (2006), and F/A-18A-D (2001) were developed prior to 2012 and thus have not been updated in over 5 years. With respect to the EA-18G, Navy officials told us that the sustainment strategy should be updated in accordance with DOD’s acquisition policy—DOD Instruction 5000.02— since the EA-18G is still in the acquisition process, as it continues to be produced. For the E-2C and F/A-18A-D, Naval Air Systems Command officials and program office officials told us that they were not required to document sustainment strategies because these aircraft were legacy systems at the time the requirement to develop and maintain a sustainment strategy was implemented. Therefore, according to these officials, the DOD requirements to document and update sustainment strategies every 5 years in DOD Instruction 5000.02 were not applicable. DOD Instruction 5000.02 requires weapon systems to have some form of a sustainment strategy that is not older than 5 years; however, it is unclear whether this policy is applicable to legacy weapon systems. Specifically, the policy states that program managers for all programs are responsible for developing and maintaining a sustainment strategy, such as a Life-cycle Sustainment Plan, beginning at the risk-reduction decision point (i.e., Milestone A of the acquisition process). However, based on our discussions with Navy program officials for our selected aircraft and our review of the policy, it is unclear whether the policy—as currently written—is applicable to legacy systems that were no longer in production and thus had completed the risk-reduction decision point (or Milestone A) prior to the requirement to update a sustainment strategy every 5 years. According to DOD officials, the intent of the policy is for all programs, including legacy weapon systems, to develop and maintain a sustainment strategy; however, the policy does not explicitly state that legacy systems are expected to fulfill this requirement. In May 2017, the Air Force updated its sustainment guidance to require sustainment strategies for legacy systems and for those strategies to be updated every 5 years. Air Force officials told us that they did this because the DOD policy was unclear whether it was applicable to legacy systems and it was a good practice to ensure the guidance was explicit for all weapon systems to document and update a sustainment strategy. This instruction explicitly states that the requirement to document a sustainment strategy and update it every 5 years is applicable to all weapon systems, including legacy systems that are in the O&S phase of their life cycles. Additionally, the Air Force Instruction states that these legacy systems are not required to retroactively meet requirements identified for previous phases of the acquisition life-cycle, but should meet the requirements needed for continued operations of the system. However, the Navy has not made the requirement explicit for legacy systems in its guidance. Specifically, Navy guidance does not explicitly state that documenting a sustainment strategy and updating that strategy every 5 years is a requirement for legacy systems. While Navy guidance requires the development and use of sustainment metrics for legacy systems and requires the Naval Air Systems Command be responsible for aviation weapon systems in sustainment, the Navy does not address any requirement for sustainment strategies for legacy systems. The lack of clarity in DOD Instruction 5000.02 and the Navy guidance regarding whether legacy systems are required to document a sustainment strategy and update that strategy every 5 years has resulted in confusion regarding sustainment planning requirements among Navy program offices and could cause confusion with other weapon system program offices across DOD. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that management should define objectives in specific terms so they are understood at all levels of the entity. The standards also state that guidance should clearly define what is to be achieved, who is to achieve it, how it will be achieved, and the time frames for achievement. As indicated by the Air Force’s 2017 update to its sustainment guidance, clarifying DOD and Navy guidance and the applicability of sustainment strategy requirements to legacy systems could be done through very small additions and clarifications to the applicable guidance documents. Until DOD and the Navy update or issue new guidance clarifying the requirements for documenting sustainment strategies for legacy systems, weapon system program offices, such as those for fixed-wing aircraft, as well as Naval Air Systems Command and DOD may not have full visibility of necessary requirements to achieve program objectives or any related risks associated with the sustainment of these weapon systems. While the DOD policy and Navy guidance is unclear, Naval Air Systems Command and Navy program offices for the four aircraft—C-2A, E-2C, EA-18G, and F/A-18A-D—that either do not have a sustainment strategy or have not updated the strategy within the last 5 years are taking actions to document or update the sustainment strategies for these aircraft. According to Naval Air Systems Command officials, once it was brought to their attention that the intent of DOD Instruction 5000.02 was for legacy systems to have an updated documented sustainment strategy, they began to take action to develop or update the respective sustainment strategies. Specifically, according to C-2A, E-2C, and E-2D program officials, they are currently updating the E-2D strategy for its 5-year update, which is due in fiscal year 2018, and it will include updates for the C-2A and E-2C since the airframe for all three aircraft are very similar. Also, program officials for the EA-18G and F/A-18A-D told us that they are currently updating the strategies for these aircraft and are expected to complete the process in fiscal year 2018. Given that the Navy is already taking action to update its sustainment strategies and has established timelines for these updates, we are not making any recommendations to the Navy regarding updating the respective sustainment strategies. The Air Force and the Navy have (1) regularly reviewed sustainment metrics for fixed-wing aircraft and (2) implemented improvement plans to address aircraft availability. The Air Force and Navy have regularly monitored the condition of their fixed-wing aircraft, which includes measuring aircraft availability against planned goals as well as monitoring other sustainment metrics. Specifically, the Air Force Materiel Command monitors aircraft availability and other sustainment metrics through quarterly Weapon System Enterprise Review (WSER) briefings. The program office in conjunction with the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center generates the WSER, which is briefed through Air Force Materiel Command and the Program Executive Offices to the Air Force Chief of Staff. The WSER delivers insight into the comprehensive health of a system by flagging gaps in performance and identifying mitigating actions, which is used to conduct crosscutting enterprise analysis and provide input into readiness reviews. In addition to the WSER, the program offices manage their performance through their Health of the Fleet briefs. These briefs—conducted monthly or quarterly depending upon the aircraft—include readiness assessments that provide insight on maintenance and management practices. The assessment is delivered by the program’s maintenance group, and includes aircraft performance metrics, issues, actions, and schedules to inform program leadership on fleet status and to help prioritize and make decisions concerning the issues. The Navy monitors aircraft availability through its aircraft status dashboard for each aircraft, which provides specific information, such as goals, actual availability, and gaps between the two. More specifically, the Navy tracks the status of each of its aircraft through the dashboard, including those aircraft that are available (i.e., Ready-Basic-Aircraft ), are in depot maintenance, or are not mission capable due to maintenance or supply, among other metrics. The dashboard is updated monthly, and there are weekly meetings with key stakeholders, including Naval Air Systems Command officials, industry partners, and depot officials, to monitor the performance of each aircraft and make adjustments to improve aircraft availability. Additionally, all program offices have processes in place to manage the fleet within their portfolios, including semiannual or annual program reviews such as Program Management Reviews and Executive Steering Reviews. These reviews focus on readiness, cost drivers, and initiatives to address program risk and ways to resolve issues affecting each aircraft. Further, the Marine Corps Commandant for Aviation leads biannual Executive Steering Summits to assess readiness issues affecting Marine Corps aircraft. The Air Force and Navy have implemented improvement plans to address aircraft availability for each of the selected fixed-wing aircraft. Air Force program offices for the fixed-wing aircraft in our review have plans for improving availability. Since 2005, the Air Force Materiel Command has had an annual process to improve aircraft availability, which is known as the Aircraft Availability Improvement Program. The process enables the program offices to assess and limit risk, incorporate available support funding, and specifically address where there are effects on availability, such as aircraft in depot. This process also incorporates projecting historical and goal rates in order to leverage scheduled and modernization maintenance. Program offices create plans, known as aircraft availability improvement plans, based on these projections to forecast improvements that can facilitate increased availability and reduction of costs, among other things. The Air Force provides guidance in the form of a template to ensure consistency amongst the plans, which typically must include improvement initiatives with milestone goals. This information includes projected aircraft availability rates for mission capable, units possessed not reported, not mission capable for supply, not mission capable for maintenance, and depot possession. Officials noted that the program office creates an improvement plan each year, regardless of whether it is short of its availability goal, since the plan serves as a forecasting measure. The program is designed to ensure the program offices have plans in place to meet target goals, and the information and milestones laid out in the plans feed into the WSER briefings to senior management. For example: The B-52 plan for fiscal year 2017 discusses the process and milestones for replacing actuator seals for the fleet, the costs of the repair, and the expected benefit to B-52 availability—1.05 percent improvement to the not mission capable supply metric. The C-17 plan for fiscal year 2017 identifies the current and future modifications, timelines for beginning and completion, and the effect on availability. For example, the future replacement of a legacy computer system with a modernized system and display is set to begin in fiscal year 2019 with an estimated completion date of 2026. This replacement is planned to be done concurrently with other maintenance, and to prevent future declines in the C-17’s availability. The F-22 plan for fiscal year 2017 identifies several projects taking place between 2016 and 2021 that are expected to improve availability by almost 2 percent. Further, officials said they are currently working with the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Acquisition) to develop an Air Force manual that would make developing an Aircraft Availability Improvement Plan a requirement. This manual will become a supplement to Air Force Instruction 63-101/20-101, according to the officials. Navy program offices for all seven fixed-wing aircraft in our review also have plans for improving availability. According to Navy officials, they started preparing “summary playbooks,” which is the Navy’s term for improvement plans, in late 2015 and started implementing these plans in early 2016 to increase aircraft availability. Officials told us that there was a limitation in funding because of sequestration prior to fiscal year 2017, which hampered their ability to fully implement the playbooks. At a broad level, the Navy’s playbooks include efforts such as maintenance planning, supply support, aircraft material condition and management, and technical data, among other things. These efforts are linked to specific initiatives such as working with the manufacturer and contractors to provide maintenance support, identifying obsolete parts, conducting aircraft fatigue analysis, and updating technical publications, among other things, which have been identified by the program office as ways to improve aircraft availability. Additionally, these playbooks include the extent to which these initiatives are funded, underfunded, or partially funded and the appropriation account that would fund each initiative. The playbooks include the status of each initiative, and some of the playbooks also provide an approximate time frame for implementing each initiative. For example: The playbook for the C-2A has a fatigue analysis initiative focused on analyzing the landing gear to update its design, provide a depot repair manual, and increase its service life, among other things. This initiative is considered funded, is expected to improve aircraft availability, and has an estimated time frame for implementation between fiscal years 2017 and 2021. The playbook for the E-2D contains a maintenance initiative focused on improving the maintenance planning process of the C-2A, E-2C, and E-2D aircraft by completing elements of the product support package, such as training, publications, support equipment, and tools, among others. This initiative is considered partially funded, is expected to improve aircraft availability by decreasing the not mission- capable rates related to maintenance and supply and decreasing maintenance down time, and has an estimated time frame for implementation between fiscal years 2017 through 2019. The playbook for the F/A-18A-D includes a product improvement initiative to conduct a case study to assess the condition of the wiring of the aircraft in the fleet. This initiative is considered funded and is expected to help to sustain aircraft availability. However, there is no time frame for implementing this initiative. The playbook for the F/A-18E-F contains a service life modification initiative focused on extending the service life of the aircraft through modifications. According to officials, this initiative is considered partially funded, is expected to help to sustain aircraft availability, and is expected to help the fleet realize an 80 percent cost avoidance because the Navy will not have to pay the cost to replace these aircraft. Also, this initiative has an estimated time frame for implementation between fiscal years 2018 through 2040. The Departments of the Air Force and Navy spend tens of billions of dollars each year to sustain their fixed-wing aircraft, which need expensive logistics support, including maintenance and repair, to meet goals for availability. The departments spent at least $20 billion annually since 2011 to sustain the 12 aircraft that we examined. The Air Force and Navy share a variety of sustainment challenges, including the age of their aircraft as well as maintenance and supply support issues. These challenges have led to half (6 of 12) of the aircraft in our review experiencing decreasing availability and to the aircraft in general not being able to meet aircraft availability goals. For example, 9 of 12 aircraft did not meet availability goals in fiscal year 2016. These trends are occurring even though the Air Force and Navy regularly review sustainment metrics for the aircraft and are implementing plans for improving aircraft availability. However, DOD’s policy and the Navy’s guidance are not clear on whether the services should have a current sustainment strategy for legacy weapon systems, including fixed-wing aircraft, and on whether the strategies are required to be updated every 5 years. Without clarity about whether the DOD instruction and the Navy guidance apply to legacy systems, program officials will not know whether they are required to have a sustainment strategy or are required to update the plan for their respective fixed-wing aircraft. Furthermore, the program offices, the services, and DOD may not have full visibility of necessary requirements to document program objectives, related risks, and the effectiveness of the program, ultimately jeopardizing the sustainability and affordability of each of the programs. We are making the following two recommendations to DOD: The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment updates or issues new policy clarifying the requirements for documenting sustainment strategies for legacy weapon systems, including fixed-wing aircraft. (Recommendation 1) The Secretary of the Navy should update or issue new guidance clarifying the requirements for documenting sustainment strategies for legacy weapon systems, including fixed-wing aircraft. (Recommendation 2) We provided a draft of the sensitive report to DOD for review and comment. In written comments that are reproduced in appendix XVI, DOD concurred with our recommendations and noted planned actions to address each recommendation. The Air Force and Navy also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees; the Secretary of Defense; the Secretaries of the Navy and Air Force; the Commandant of the Marine Corps; the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment; and the Director, Defense Logistics Agency. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have questions about this report, please contact me at merrittz@gao.gov or (202) 512-5257. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix XVII. Over the past several years, we have conducted work on a number of issues that affect the ability of the Department of Defense (DOD) to sustain its weapon systems. In September 2017, we found that several factors were important to the success of Product Support Managers. These factors included teamwork and collaboration, early implementation of the Product Support Manager position, and organizational support and emphasis on sustainment. We also found that in response to our 2014 recommendations regarding the implementation of the Product Support Manager position, DOD had developed a comprehensive career path and associated guidance to develop, train, and support future Product Support Managers. Additionally, DOD revised guidance to define roles, responsibilities, and reporting relationships between support staff and Product Support Managers. However, DOD was still in the process of implementing our other three recommendations, such as issuing clear, comprehensive, centralized guidance regarding the roles and responsibilities of PSMs and collecting and evaluating information on the effects, if any, that Product Support Managers are having on life-cycle sustainment decisions for their assigned weapon systems. In September 2017, we also found that DOD does not have complete information to identify and manage single-source-of-supply risks. Specifically, some parts are provided by a single source of supply (e.g., one manufacturing facility), and if that single source were no longer able to provide the part, DOD could face challenges in maintaining weapon systems. DOD concurred with our six recommendations focused on improving the completeness of information for single-source-of-supply risks, including issuing department-wide policy that clearly defines requirements of Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages management, and details responsibilities and procedures to be followed to implement the policy. DOD is in the process of taking action to implement these recommendations. In June 2016, we found that the Defense Logistics Agency and the military services have not adopted metrics to measure the accuracy of planning factors, such as the accuracy of part lists, or the costs created by backorders. As a result, depot maintenance may not be efficient or cost-effective, resulting in unnecessary delays in the repair of weapon systems. DOD concurred with our six recommendations to develop metrics to monitor the accuracy of demand planning factors and disruption costs created by the lack of parts at depot maintenance sites and is in the process of taking action to implement these recommendations. For a listing of relevant past GAO work, see the Related GAO Products list at the end of this report. Sustainment: Depot maintenance conducted organically at the designated air logistics complex and contractually for some depot- level repairs at contractor facilities. The B-52 is a long-range, heavy bomber that can perform a variety of missions, including strategic attack, close air support, air interdiction, maritime operations, and offensive counter-air missions. It can carry nuclear or precision-guided conventional ordnance with worldwide precision navigation capability. However, the B-52s are some of the oldest aircraft in the Air Force’s fleet, and will continue to operate until at least 2040 (see fig. 8). Operating and support (O&S) costs for the B-52s have remained relatively steady, generally fluctuating around $1.2 billion–$1.3 billion per year. As a predominantly military-maintained system, most of that O&S cost is related to maintenance and manpower, with depot maintenance and depot-level reparables—direct labor and materials for item repairs, transportation, and storage, among other things—accounting for most of the maintenance cost. Technology Program (2014) is focused on upgrading outdated communications technology. The communications modification requires 7,000 hours of work and is estimated to be complete by 2020. The fleet has active sustainment plans for other components of the aircraft, such as the B-52 Anti-skid Replacement Life Cycle Sustainment Plan (2015), which is estimated to cost over $40 million and be completed by 2019. The B-52 faces sustainment challenges related to its age and, according to officials, replacement parts are difficult to obtain. Several modernization efforts are under way (communications, engines, etc.), and is working with vendors and its own service engineers to identify problem areas and plan ahead so that replacement parts will be available. Depot maintenance on the B-52 is managed by the program office and conducted at Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex depot. This report is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued on April 25, 2018. DOD deemed some of the information, such as aircraft availability, not mission capable rates, number of aircraft in depots, and budgeted and executed flight hours to be sensitive (i.e., For Official Use Only). This public report omits the information that DOD deemed to be sensitive. The C-17 is a long-range, heavy logistic transport aircraft powered by four F-117 turbofan engines with air-refueling capability that was first manufactured in 1987 (see fig. 10). It is capable of rapid strategic delivery of troops and all types of cargo to main operating bases or to bases in any forward deployment area. The C-17 can perform tactical airlift and airdrop missions and can transport ambulatory patients during aeromedical evacuations, when required. The C-17 can carry virtually all air-transportable equipment. Total operating and support (O&S) costs for the C-17 have decreased from about $5.3 billion in fiscal 2011 to about $4.0 billion in fiscal year 2016. Specifically, unit operations decreased, while maintenance costs have generally increased during this period due to contractor logistics support because the C-17 is a predominantly contractor-managed aircraft. The C-17 Enterprise Life Cycle Management Plan and Life Cycle Sustainment Plan (2014) documents current and future acquisition, sustainment, and integration efforts of the aircraft. It also addresses contractual arrangements and partnership support agreements between Air Force, Boeing, and other service providers for aircraft sustainment. Boeing provides continued sole-source life-cycle support for the C-17 under the terms of the Globemaster Integrated Sustainment Program (2013). Under this program, Boeing is responsible for sustainment, to include material management and depot maintenance support. The C-17 participates in a virtual fleet arrangement, a global network of 43 additional C-17 aircraft, which allows participants total aircraft parts access from any fleet participant worldwide. The C-17 is an aircraft being modified to meet its requirements as well as to address maintenance and supply issues. The Air Force’s actions to mitigate these challenges include processes to increase the service life of the aircraft, allowing managers to quickly hire skilled workers for critical positions, and locating other vendor source for parts. Logistics Complex, and at its facility in San Antonio; landing gear overhaul occurs at Ogden Air Logistics Complex, and engine overhaul occurs at Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex in partnership with Pratt & Whitney, the original equipment manufacturer on the F-117 turbofan engine. This report is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued on April 25, 2018. DOD deemed some of the information, such as aircraft availability, not mission capable rates, number of aircraft in depots, and budgeted and executed flight hours to be sensitive (i.e., For Official Use Only). This public report omits the information that DOD deemed to be sensitive. Sustainment: Depot maintenance conducted by Northrop Grumman, and field maintenance conducted organically, by the National Guard. The E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (E-8C) was first manufactured in 1967 (see fig. 12). Its primary mission is to provide theater ground and air commanders with ground surveillance to support attack operations and targeting that contributes to the delay, disruption, and destruction of enemy forces. Total operating and support (O&S) costs for the E-8C have generally increased from about $686 million in fiscal year 2011 to about $734 million in fiscal year 2016. Specifically, maintenance cost has increased partly because of increases in contractor logistics support since the E-8C is maintained by Northrop Grumman. E-8C aircraft were formerly used as commercial airliners and purchased by the Air Force. Therefore, the exact usage of the aircraft was unknown with any degree of specificity. The program office has utilized new analysis conducted by Boeing to develop an improved method of determining and tracking service life for the E-8C aircraft. The new method uses a quantitative analysis capability to identify safety of flight structural concerns, allowing for planning and execution of risk mitigation. The E-8C is an aircraft with significant maintenance and supply issues according to Air Force officials. The Air Force’s actions to mitigate these challenges include updating the Maintenance Plan and the Corrosion Plan for the E-8C (formerly a commercial airframe) to bring them in line with military standards. This report is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued on April 25, 2018. DOD deemed some of the information, such as aircraft availability, not mission capable rates, number of aircraft in depots, and budgeted and executed flight hours to be sensitive (i.e., For Official Use Only). This public report omits the information that DOD deemed to be sensitive. Sustainment: Depot maintenance conducted organically at the designated air logistics complex, and field maintenance conducted organically and by contractors. The F-16 Fighting Falcon is a compact, single-engine, multirole fighter aircraft first manufactured in 1978 (see figure 14). It is highly maneuverable and participates in air-to-air combat and air-to-surface attack. There are four versions of the F-16: A, single-seat model; B, two-seat model with tandem cockpits; C and D, single- and two-seat models, respectively, incorporating newer capabilities. Total operating and support (O&S) cost for the F-16 decreased from about $5 billion in fiscal year 2011 to about $4 billion in fiscal year 2016 because of a 6 percent reduction of inventory. Specifically, maintenance cost has generally decreased during this same period as a result of a decrease in cost of depot maintenance. Sustainment: Performance-based logistics contract with depot maintenance subcontracted to Ogden Air Logistics Complex, Utah, and field maintenance performed organically. and is designed to project air dominance, rapidly and at great distances, and defeat threats. Overall operating and support costs (O&S) for the F-22 have decreased about $248 million overall since fiscal year 2011. Maintenance issues continue to be an area of concern for the aircraft, and these costs increased approximately $255 million from fiscal years 2011 to 2016, due to increases in contractor logistics costs. maintaining a comprehensive diminishing manufacturing sources program and proactively supporting the continued sustainment of component parts of the aircraft through various replacement programs, such as the F-22 Reliability and Maintainability Maturation. This initiative is an ongoing effort to drive continuous improvement in availability. The F-22 faces issues with its low- observable coating and supply funding. Actions to mitigate these challenges include contracting a repair facility to conduct coating reversion repair and securing additional spares funding. This report is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued on April 25, 2018. DOD deemed some of the information, such as aircraft availability, not mission capable rates, number of aircraft in depots, and budgeted and executed flight hours to be sensitive (i.e., For Official Use Only). This public report omits the information that DOD deemed to be sensitive. The AV-8B Harrier (AV-8B) is a Vertical/Short Take-off and Landing attack aircraft first manufactured in 1984 (see fig. 18). The AV-8B has the capability of conducting close air support using conventional weapons for intermediate range intercept and attack missions. The AV-8B is capable of deploying and operating on aircraft carriers and other suitable seagoing platforms, advanced bases, expeditionary airfields, and remote tactical landing sites. Total operating and support (O&S) costs for the AV-8B have decreased from about $815 million in fiscal year 2011 to about $646 million in fiscal year 2016. Specifically, unit-level manpower and operations as well as maintenance costs have decreased partly because the inventory is decreasing as AV-8B squadrons transition to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Average number of flying hours: 4,711 hours per aircraft Operating and support cost: $646 million Depot maintenance activity and squadron locations: AV-8B Program Strategic Sustainment and Warfighting Relevance Plan (2013) addresses strategic sustainment and warfighting requirements to ensure relevance, reliability, safety, and sustainability through five pillars: recruit and retain high-quality people, develop a comprehensive readiness and sustainment plan, meet combatant commander requirements, retain and sustain government and industry agencies to support engineering and logistics requirements, and integrate capabilities to remain tactically relevant and operationally effective. AV-8B is maintained organically at Navy Fleet Readiness Centers under planned maintenance intervals occurring every 1,500 flight hours; supply support is provided organically by Naval Supply Systems Command and Defense Logistics Agency; contractor support services are provided by Boeing. This report is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued on April 25, 2018. DOD deemed some of the information, such as aircraft availability, not mission capable rates, number of aircraft in depots, and budgeted and executed flight hours to be sensitive (i.e., For Official Use Only). This public report omits the information that DOD deemed to be sensitive. Manufacturer: Grumman Corporation (acquired by Northrop Grumman) The C-2A Greyhound Logistics Aircraft (C-2A) is a high-wing, twin-engine monoplane cargo aircraft first manufactured in 1965 (see fig. 20). It is designed to land on aircraft carriers, with a primary mission of providing critical logistics support to Carrier Strike Groups by transporting high-priority cargo, mail, and passengers between carriers and shore bases. The original C-2A aircraft were overhauled to extend their operational life in 1973 and again from 2004 through 2011. Total operating and support (O&S) costs for the C-2A have generally decreased from about $233 million in fiscal year 2011 to about $207 million in fiscal year 2016. Specifically, unit-level manpower, unit operations, and continuing system improvements have decreased, while maintenance costs have increased. landing gear, and avionics system, among others. The Navy will include an appendix for the C-2A when it updates the sustainment strategy for the E 2D for its 5-year update. C-2A completed a service life extension program from 2004 through 2011 to increase flight hours from 10,000 to 15,000 and landings from 16,020 to 36,000, among other things. Aircraft are maintained organically by field maintainers and at Navy Fleet Readiness Centers under a planned maintenance interval cycle with three planned maintenance interval events occurring consecutively every 24 months, and supply support is provided organically by the Naval Supply Systems Command and Defense Logistics Agency. This report is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued on April 25, 2018. DOD deemed some of the information, such as aircraft availability, not mission capable rates, number of aircraft in depots, and budgeted and executed flight hours to be sensitive (i.e., For Official Use Only). This public report omits the information that DOD deemed to be sensitive. The E-2 Hawkeye (E-2C) is the Navy’s all-weather, carrier-based tactical battle management, surface surveillance coordination and airborne early warning, command and control aircraft, with a planned sunset in 2026 when the last E-2D is delivered (see fig. 22). The E-2 is a twin-engine, five- crewmember, high-wing turboprop aircraft with a 24-foot diameter radar rotodome attached to the upper fuselage. Total operating and support (O&S) costs for the E-2 have decreased from about $536 million in fiscal year 2011 to about $345 million in fiscal year 2016. Specifically, unit manpower and maintenance costs have decreased, partly because E-2C inventory is decreasing as E-2C squadrons transition to the E-2D fleet. comprehensive sustainment logistics, engineering programs, and financial resources necessary to ensure continued platform sustainment and attainment of readiness and safety operations. The Navy will include an appendix for the E-2C when it updates the sustainment strategy for the E-2D for its 5-year update. E-2C is maintained organically by field maintainers and at Navy Fleet Readiness Centers under a planned maintenance interval cycle: initial planned maintenance interval is performed by field maintainers at 42 months and the second cycle is performed at a Fleet Readiness Center 46 months after the initial planned maintenance interval. Supply support is provided organically by the Naval Supply Systems Command and Defense Logistics Agency; contractor support services are provided by General Dynamics and Wyle Labs. This report is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued on April 25, 2018. DOD deemed some of the information, such as aircraft availability, not mission capable rates, number of aircraft in depots, and budgeted and executed flight hours to be sensitive (i.e., For Official Use Only). This public report omits the information that DOD deemed to be sensitive. The E-2 Advanced Hawkeye (E-2D) is the newest variant of the E-2 aircraft platform, expecting to reach full operational capability by 2027 (see fig. 24). Using the same configuration as the E-2C, the E-2D aircraft is used for surface-surveillance coordination and airborne early warning, and command control. Its mission is to provide advanced warning of approaching enemy surface units, and cruise missiles and aircraft, among other things. Total operating and support (O&S) costs for the E-2D have increased consistently since fiscal year 2011 to about $125 million in fiscal year 2016. This increase is driven by the addition of aircraft to the inventory as the Navy continues to produce E-2D aircraft through 2026. This report is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued on April 25, 2018. DOD deemed some of the information, such as aircraft availability, not mission capable rates, number of aircraft in depots, and budgeted and executed flight hours to be sensitive (i.e., For Official Use Only). This public report omits the information that DOD deemed to be sensitive. The EA-18G Growler is the fourth major variant of the F/A-18 family of aircraft manufactured in 2007 to replace the EA-6B Prowler (see fig. 26). The EA-18G is the first newly designed electronic warfare aircraft produced in more than 35 years and combines the proven F/A-18 Super Hornet platform with a sophisticated electronic warfare suite. Total O&S costs for the EA-18G have consistently increased from about $334 million in fiscal year 2011 to about $868 million in fiscal year 2016. Specifically, unit manpower and maintenance costs have increased partly because the inventory is increasing, as EA-18Gs are still in production. design, development, and fielding of the aircraft. Some of the key support program elements include developing support equipment and technical data, testing requirements for avionics, and facilities requirements, among others. The Navy is updating this plan and expects to finalize it in 2018. The aircraft are maintained organically at Navy Fleet Readiness Centers under planned maintenance intervals, which typically occur every 72 months. Also, the Navy partners with Boeing to provide wholesale supply and depot repair support for major components, such as the engine. This report is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued on April 25, 2018. DOD deemed some of the information, such as aircraft availability, not mission capable rates, number of aircraft in depots, and budgeted and executed flight hours to be sensitive (i.e., For Official Use Only). This public report omits the information that DOD deemed to be sensitive. The F/A-18A-D Hornet Strike Fighter is a twin-engine, mid-wing, multimission tactical aircraft initially fielded in the 1980s (see fig. 28). In its fighter mode, it is used primarily as a fighter escort and for air defense; in its attack mode, it is used for force projection, interdiction, and air support. Total operating and support (O&S) costs for the F/A-18A-D have decreased consistently from about $3.1 billion in fiscal year 2011 to about $2.4 billion in fiscal year 2016. Specifically, unit manpower, operations, and maintenance costs have decreased, partly because the F/A-18A-Ds are being permanently transitioned out of service to be replaced by the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.. and financial resources necessary to ensure continued readiness and supportability for the remainder of the aircraft’s service life. The Navy is currently updating this plan and expects to finalize it in 2018. The aircraft are maintained organically at Navy Fleet Readiness Centers under planned maintenance intervals, which typically occur every 48 months for carrier-deploying aircraft, and every 72 months for land-based aircraft. The Navy implemented the High-Flight-Hour program in 2006 to extend the service life from 8,000 to 10,000 flight hours by inspecting and repairing airframes, and replacing major components and parts. The High-Flight-Hour program, along with other factors, has led to maintenance carryover (i.e., into the next fiscal year) due to maintenance events taking longer than planned. In 1999, the Navy entered into a contract with Boeing for engineering support to leverage resources within the technology and industrial base to improve efficiency of the maintenance process and address the maintenance backlog. The F/A-18A-D is operating beyond its planned service life with maintenance and supply issues. The Navy’s actions to mitigate these challenges include extending the service life of the aircraft, allowing maintainers to work overtime to reduce backlog, and cannibalizing parts—moving parts from one aircraft to another. This report is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued on April 25, 2018. DOD deemed some of the information, such as aircraft availability, not mission capable rates, number of aircraft in depots, and budgeted and executed flight hours to be sensitive (i.e., For Official Use Only). This public report omits the information that DOD deemed to be sensitive. The F/A-18E-F Super Hornet was first manufactured in 1998 (see fig. 30). The F/A-18E-F is highly capable across the full mission spectrum: air superiority, fighter escort, reconnaissance, aerial refueling, close air support, air defense suppression, and day/night precision strike. The F/A-18E-F provides aircrew the capability and performance necessary to face 21st century threats. Total operating and support (O&S) costs for the F/A-18E-4 have increased from about $2.2 billion in fiscal year 2011 to about $3.1 billion in fiscal year 2016. Specifically, unit manpower, maintenance, and continuing system support have increased, partly because the inventory is increasing, as the F/A-18E-F is still in production. the Navy is conducting an assessment to determine the number of flight hours the aircraft can safely continue to fly, and then extend the service life of the program through inspections, repairs, and modifications, among other things. The Navy contracted with Boeing to potentially begin these efforts by fiscal year 2018. The F/A-18E-F is a high operational tempo aircraft supporting contingency operations with maintenance and supply issues. The Navy’s actions to mitigate these challenges include plans to extend the service life of the aircraft, training maintainers to transition to vacated positions, and cannibalizing parts—removing parts from one aircraft to another. This report is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued on April 25, 2018. DOD deemed some of the information, such as aircraft availability, not mission capable rates, number of aircraft in depots, and budgeted and executed flight hours to be sensitive (i.e., For Official Use Only). This public report omits the information that DOD deemed to be sensitive. To examine the trends in aircraft availability and operating and support (O&S) costs for selected Air Force and Navy fixed-wing aircraft, including whether the aircraft met availability goals, we selected a nongeneralizable sample of 12 fixed-wing aircraft managed by the Departments of the Air Force and the Navy. These included two Marine Corps aircraft that are managed by the Department of the Navy. This nongeneralizable sample was selected to ensure a mix of aircraft, including type of aircraft (fighter, bomber, cargo, etc.), age of the aircraft, and size of inventory, and whether the aircraft were sustained organically by the Department of Defense (DOD) or through contract arrangements, such as public-private partnerships or performance-based logistics, among other factors. For the Air Force, we selected five fixed-wing aircraft—the B-52 Stratofortress, C-17 Globemaster III, E-8C Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS), F-16 Fighting Falcon, and F-22 Raptor. For the Navy, including the Marine Corps, we selected seven fixed-wing aircraft—the AV-8B Harrier, C-2A Greyhound Logistics Aircraft, E-2 Hawkeye Early Warning and Control Aircraft, E-2 Advanced Hawkeye Early Warning and Control Aircraft, EA-18G Growler, F/A-18 Hornet Strike Fighter A-D, and F/A-18 Super Hornet E-F. The Marine Corps uses the AV-8B Harrier and also uses a variant of the F/A-18A-D. For the selected aircraft, we obtained and reviewed the aircraft availability, sustainment, and O&S data for accuracy and completeness, interviewed officials regarding their data-collection processes, and reviewed available related policies and procedures associated with the collection of the data. As a result, we found the information to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of presenting sustainment metrics, such as aircraft availability and O&S costs. status due to maintenance, supply, and both. With respect to O&S costs, we collected and analyzed data from fiscal years 2011 through 2016. We conducted data-reliability assessments for the data provided by the Air Force and the Navy. To do this, we sent data-reliability questionnaires to both departments requesting information on the sources that generated the data. For the Air Force, we conducted data-reliability assessments on the Air Force Total Ownership Cost system and the Logistics Installation and Mission Support system. For the Navy, we conducted data-reliability assessments on the Aviation Management Supply and Readiness Reporting—Type Model Series Integrated Database, the Decision Knowledge Programming for Logistics Analysis and Technical Evaluation system, the Flying Hour Projection System / Cost Adjustment and Visibility Tracking System, and the Visibility and Management of Operating and Support Costs system. We reviewed responses from both departments on these sources as well as documentation—such as guidance, user manuals, and data dictionaries—provided to corroborate questionnaire responses, and interviewed knowledgeable officials to discuss the data. We concluded that the data provided by the Air Force and the Navy were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of reporting condition metrics such as aircraft availability; not mission capable status due to maintenance, supply, and both; depot inductions; budgeted and executed flight hours; and O&S costs for the selected fixed-wing aircraft in our review. To identify the sustainment challenges and mitigation actions for the selected aircraft, we reviewed sustainment metrics data, performance briefings, and other relevant documentation to identify specific challenges for each of the 12 aircraft in our review. We also reviewed ongoing and planned actions to address those challenges. Additionally, we interviewed program officials, depot officials, field maintainers, and squadron personnel to obtain their views on the challenges they face in sustaining the aircraft and the actions they take to mitigate those challenges. In some instances, we visited depots and squadrons to observe aircraft undergoing maintenance, discuss the respective maintenance processes, and discuss challenges and mitigation actions with officials. We then grouped the identified challenges into categories and represented them in a table to demonstrate which aircraft are experiencing specific challenges. To assess the extent to which the Air Force and the Navy have sustainment strategies, regularly review sustainment metrics, and have plans to improve aircraft availability for the selected fixed-wing aircraft, we obtained and analyzed sustainment strategies, performance management frameworks (i.e., sustainment metrics collected and monitored as well as the levels of management review), and improvement plans for each of the selected 12 fixed-wing aircraft. We also identified and reviewed DOD, Air Force, and Navy guidance to analyze the departments’ efforts in sustaining these aircraft and to determine whether these were consistent with federal standards for internal control that deal with management defining objectives in specific terms. Specifically, we reviewed DOD Instruction 5000.02, Operation of the Defense Acquisition System, which provides management principles and mandatory policies for defense acquisition systems such as fixed- wing aircraft. These policies incorporate decision processes and assessing of readiness, which includes the creation of and requirements for a Life-cycle Sustainment Plan. We also reviewed Air Force Instruction 63-101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle Management, which implements various Air Force and DOD policy directives, including DOD Instruction 5000.02. It establishes the integrated life-cycle management guidelines and procedures for Air Force personnel who develop, review, approve, or manage the systems, subsystems, end-items, services, and activities procured by the Air Force. For the Navy, we reviewed Secretary of the Navy M-5000.2, Department of the Navy Acquisition and Capabilities Guidebook, which provides guidance for the operation of the defense acquisition system and the joint capabilities integration and development system. It also implements DOD Instruction 5000.02 for the Navy and Marine Corps, including guidance on the management and execution of a sustainment strategy. and service guidance. We also reviewed the Air Force’s and the Navy’s performance metric briefings and improvement plans to determine whether the departments regularly reviewed sustainment metrics and had plans aimed at improving aircraft availability. We interviewed DOD, Air Force, and Navy officials knowledgeable about sustainment of these selected fixed-wing aircraft to discuss DOD’s and the departments’ efforts in sustaining these aircraft, including historical information on each aircraft, applicability of policy and guidance for legacy aircraft, and overviews of performance management frameworks identified by the departments to monitor and improve aircraft availability. To develop the fixed-wing aircraft sustainment summary documents (i.e., “Sustainment Quick Looks”) in appendixes II–XIII we obtained historical and current information including background on aircraft capabilities, manufacturer, sustainment strategy, depot maintenance and squadron locations, and key dates in the life cycle of each aircraft (i.e., first manufactured, initial and full operational capability, last production, and planned sunset year). We collected and analyzed the following metrics: aircraft availability, not mission capable maintenance, not mission capable supply, and not mission capable aircraft from fiscal year 2011 through March 2017; the number of aircraft in depots for fiscal years 2011 through 2016; budgeted and executed flight hours from fiscal years 2011 through overall O&S and maintenance costs for fiscal years 2011 through 2016. We compared availability actuals to goals, aircraft in depots to availability trends, and budgeted and executed flight hours to availability trends. We analyzed O&S cost by reviewing its six elements and compared them to availability trends. We also analyzed the subcategories of the maintenance costs element. Through interviews with knowledgeable officials and reviewing documentation, we identified sustainment challenges (i.e., aging, maintenance and supply support) and mitigation actions to address these challenges for each selected fixed-wing aircraft. DOD deemed some of the information, such as aircraft availability, not mission capable status, number of aircraft in depots, and budgeted and executed flight hours, to be sensitive (i.e., For Official Use Only), which must be protected from public disclosure. This public report omits the information that DOD deemed to be sensitive. Additionally, to support our work for each objective we conducted site visits and interviewed officials to discuss data trends and identify specific sustainment challenges such as aging, maintenance, and supply support, among other challenges affecting aircraft availability, and mitigation actions to address these challenges. For the Air Force, we met with the following entities: Headquarters—Secretary of the Air Force, Logistics and Product Support and Deputy Assistant Secretary for Cost and Economics, Air Force Cost Analysis Agency; Materiel Commands—Air Force Materiel Command and Air Force Life Cycle Management Center; Program Offices—B-52 Program Office, C-17 Program Office, E-8C Program Office, F-16 Program Office, and F-22 Program Office; Depots—Tinker Air Force Base at Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (B-52); Robins Air Force Base at Warner Robbins, Georgia (C-17); Northrop Grumman facility at Lake Charles, Louisiana (E-8C); Ogden Air Logistics Center / Hill Air Force Base at Ogden, Utah (F-16 and F-22); and Squadrons—437th Maintenance Group, Joint Base Charleston, South Carolina (C-17); 461st Air Control Wing, Robins Air Force Base Georgia (E-8C); 20th Fighter Wing, Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina (F-16); and 325th Maintenance Group, Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida (F-22). For the Navy, we met with the following entities: Headquarters—Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy— Expeditionary Programs and Logistics Management, Marine Corps Aviation Plans and Policy Branch, and Air Warfare Division; Materiel Commands—Commander, Fleet Readiness Center; Naval Air Systems Command; and Naval Supply Systems Command; Program Offices—Program Manager–Air (PMA)-231 (C-2A, E-2C, and E-2D); PMA- 257 (AV-8B); and PMA-265 (F/A-18A-F, and EA- 18G); Depots—Fleet Readiness Center–East at Cherry Point, North Carolina; Fleet Readiness Center–Mid Atlantic at Naval Air Station Norfolk, Virginia, and Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia; Squadrons—Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina; Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, California; Naval Air Station Norfolk, Virginia; and Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia; and Other—Naval Center for Cost Analysis. The performance audit upon which this report is based was conducted from September 2016 to April 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate, evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We subsequently worked with DOD from April 2018 to September 2018 to prepare this unclassified version of the original sensitive report for public release. This public version was also prepared in accordance with these standards. For fiscal year 2016, total operating and support (O&S) costs for the five Air Force fixed-wing aircraft selected in our review were about $12 billion, and the average O&S cost per aircraft across all five fleets was about $96 million, as shown in figure 32. Each of the C-17 and F-16 fleets accounted for about 33 percent of the total O&S cost, and the E-8C’s average cost per aircraft accounted for about 48 percent of the total average cost per aircraft. For fiscal year 2016, total O&S costs for the seven Navy fixed-wing aircraft selected in our review were about $7.7 billion, and the average O&S cost per aircraft across all seven fleets was about $44 million, as shown in figure 33. The F/A-18E-F fleet accounted for about 40 percent of the total O&S cost, and the E-2C’s average cost per aircraft accounted for about 19 percent of the total average cost per aircraft. In addition to the contact named above, John Bumgarner (Assistant Director), Clarine Allen, Ron Aribo, Vincent Buquicchio, Amie Lesser, Richard Powelson, Steven Putansu, Matt Spiers, and Natasha Wilder made key contributions to this report.

The Air Force and Navy are operating many of their fixed-wing aircraft well beyond their original designed service lives and therefore are confronted with sustainment challenges. House Report 114-537 included a provision for GAO to evaluate the sustainment of major weapon systems. This report, among other things, (1) examines the trends in availability and O&S costs for selected Air Force and Navy fixed-wing aircraft since fiscal year 2011, including whether they met availability goals, and (2) assesses the extent that the departments documented sustainment strategies, reviewed sustainment metrics, and implemented plans to improve aircraft availability. GAO selected a nongeneralizable sample of 12 fixed-wing aircraft by considering a variety of factors, such as the type, age, and manufacturer of the aircraft, among other factors, and analyzed condition and availability data, O&S costs, and sustainment challenges from fiscal year 2011 through March 2017 for each aircraft in a “Sustainment Quick Look.” GAO also analyzed policies, strategies, and plans, and interviewed Navy and Air Force officials in program offices, squadrons, and maintenance depots. Between fiscal years 2011 and 2016, the Air Force and Navy generally did not meet aircraft availability goals, and operating and support (O&S) cost trends for GAO's selected fixed-wing aircraft varied. Specifically, GAO found that availability declined for 6 of 12 aircraft—3 from each service—between fiscal years 2011 and 2016; availability fell short of goals for 9 of 12 aircraft in fiscal year 2016; and O&S costs increased for 5 of the aircraft, and maintenance costs—the largest share—increased for 8 of 12 aircraft. GAO found, and officials agreed, that these aircraft face similar challenges. a Obsolescence means a part is unavailable due to its lack of usefulness or it is no longer current or available for production. b Diminishing manufacturing sources is a loss or impending loss of manufacturers or suppliers. The Air Force and Navy have documented sustainment strategies for some aircraft, regularly reviewed sustainment metrics, and implemented improvement plans. The Air Force has documented sustainment strategies for all aircraft GAO reviewed; however, the Navy has not documented or updated its sustainment strategies for four aircraft. Specifically, the Navy does not have a documented sustainment strategy for the C-2A, and has not updated the strategies for the E2C, EA-18G, and F/A-18A-D since before 2012. The Navy is in the process of documenting its strategies, but Department of Defense (DOD) policy is unclear on whether a sustainment strategy is required and has to be updated every 5 years for weapon systems that are in the operations and support phase of their life cycle (i.e., legacy systems). Also, Navy guidance does not specify a requirement for legacy systems, although Air Force guidance does. Clarifying the requirements to document sustainment strategies for legacy systems, and documenting those strategies, would add additional visibility over the availability and O&S costs of DOD aircraft and any associated sustainment risks. This is a public version of a sensitive report issued in April 2018. Information on aircraft availability and other related information was deemed to be sensitive and has been omitted from this report. GAO is recommending that DOD and the Navy update or issue new policy and guidance clarifying the requirements for documenting sustainment strategies for legacy weapon systems. DOD concurred with the recommendations.""]","12207","gov_report","en","None","e6030e255f6b8c70f7b3c9faf0320d4f7729b4eddacf727f","Summary:","gov_report","532","\nThe report examines the sustainment of selected Air Force and Navy fixed-wing aircraft in wing aircraft, including their operating and support management, and the challenges they are faced by aging, maintenance, supply chain, and supply chain management.

"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nAs reported by the United Nations, the International Criminal Police Organization, and other organizations, wildlife trafficking networks span the globe. These organizations have attempted to measure the value of illegally traded wildlife, but available estimates are subject to uncertainty. In 2016, for example, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) reported that various sources estimated the global scale of illegal wildlife trade to be from $7 billion to $23 billion annually. UNEP also estimated that the scale of wildlife crime has increased in recent years in part based on a rise in environmental crime. U.S. trade in wildlife and related products includes a variety of species, such as live reptiles, birds, and mammals, as well as elephant ivory, according to law enforcement reports and government and nongovernmental officials. FWS and NOAA data on wildlife products seized at U.S. ports provide examples of the diversity of illegally traded plants, fish, and wildlife imported into or exported from the United States. For example, from 2007 to 2016, the top 10 plant, fish, and wildlife shipments seized nationally by FWS were coral, crocodiles, conchs, deer, pythons, sea turtles, mollusks, ginseng, clams, and seahorses. During that time, FWS reported that more than one-third of the wildlife shipments it seized were confiscated while being imported from or exported to Mexico (14 percent), China (13 percent), or Canada (9 percent). FWS and NOAA law enforcement offices are responsible for enforcing certain laws and treaties prohibiting wildlife trafficking. FWS Office of Law Enforcement. This office enforces certain U.S. laws and regulations as well as treaties prohibiting the trafficking of terrestrial wildlife, freshwater species, and birds. Among other things, the office aims to prevent the unlawful import, export, and interstate commerce of foreign fish and wildlife, as well as to protect U.S. plants, fish, and wildlife from unlawful exploitation. As of fiscal year 2016, the office had a budget of $74.7 million and employed 205 special agents to investigate wildlife crime, including international and domestic wildlife trafficking rings. Most of these special agents report to one of eight regional offices, which receive national oversight, support, training, and policy guidance from the FWS Office of Law Enforcement headquarters. The office’s headquarters houses a special investigative unit focused on conducting complex, large- scale criminal investigations of wildlife traffickers. In addition, the FWS Office of Law Enforcement has deployed special agents to serve as international attachés at seven U.S. embassies. These attachés provide countertrafficking expertise to embassy staff, work with host government officials to build law enforcement capacity, and contribute directly to casework or criminal investigations of wildlife traffickers. According to FWS data, the FWS Office of Law Enforcement opened more than 7,000 investigations on wildlife trafficking and other illegal activities in fiscal year 2016, including nearly 5,000 cases involving Endangered Species Act violations and nearly 1,500 cases involving Lacey Act violations. FWS Office of Law Enforcement investigations have disrupted wildlife trafficking operations. For example, Operation Crash—an ongoing rhino horn and elephant ivory-trafficking investigation launched in 2011—has led to over 30 convictions and more than $2 million in fines. NOAA Office of Law Enforcement. This office enforces certain U.S. laws and regulations as well as treaties prohibiting the trafficking of marine wildlife, including fish, as well as anadromous fish. Among other things, the office aims to prevent the illegal, unregulated, and unreported harvesting and trade of fish as well as the trafficking of protected marine wildlife. As of fiscal year 2016, the office had a budget of $68.6 million and employed 77 special agents to investigate wildlife crimes within its jurisdiction. These agents report to one of five regional offices, and those offices receive national oversight, support, and policy guidance from the NOAA Office of Law Enforcement headquarters. According to NOAA data, the NOAA Office of Law Enforcement initiated more than 5,000 investigations in fiscal year 2016. About half of those investigations involved violations of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, as amended, and some of the 5,000 investigations involved violations of the Endangered Species Act or the Lacey Act. NOAA Office of Law Enforcement investigations have disrupted wildlife trafficking operations. For example, in fiscal year 2016, a NOAA Office of Law Enforcement investigation led to the conviction of a company and five individuals for illegally trafficking whale bone carvings, walrus ivory carvings, black coral carvings, and other products derived from protected species into the United States. The FWS and NOAA law enforcement offices collaborate with other government agencies and organizations to combat wildlife trafficking. Both agencies work with other federal, state, and tribal law enforcement officers as well as their international counterparts as needed during wildlife trafficking investigations. For example, FWS and NOAA work with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to maintain import and export controls and interdict smuggled wildlife and related products at U.S. ports of entry. In addition, FWS and NOAA collaborate with Department of Justice prosecutors on criminal cases that result from agency investigations. Both agencies also collaborate with nongovernmental organizations to combat wildlife trafficking. For example, FWS and NOAA officials said that nongovernmental organizations have, in some cases, offered financial rewards (in addition to rewards offered by FWS and NOAA) for information on a wildlife crime. In addition, some nongovernmental organizations proactively provide information to FWS and NOAA on wildlife trafficking activities in the United States or foreign countries that violate U.S. laws. For example, in 2017, a nongovernmental organization created a website to collect tips on wildlife crime and to connect the sources of those tips with relevant U.S. authorities for potential financial rewards. FWS may pay financial rewards from moneys in two accounts. Law Enforcement Reward Account. FWS may pay rewards under the Endangered Species Act, the Lacey Act, and the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act from moneys in the agency’s Law Enforcement Reward Account. The moneys in this account come from fines, penalties, and proceeds from forfeited property for violations of these three laws. According to FWS officials, these moneys are available until expended. These moneys can be used to (1) pay financial rewards to those who provide information that leads to an arrest, criminal conviction, civil penalty assessment, or forfeiture of property for any violation of the Endangered Species Act, the Lacey Act, or the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act or (2) provide temporary care for plants, fish, or wildlife that are the subject of a civil or criminal proceeding under the Endangered Species Act, Lacey Act, or the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act. As of the beginning of fiscal year 2017, the balance of the Law Enforcement Reward Account was about $7 million. Law Enforcement Special Funds Account. FWS may also pay rewards from moneys in its law enforcement office’s Special Funds Account. The moneys in this account come from an annual line item appropriation and are available until expended. Since fiscal year 1988, this appropriation has provided FWS up to $400,000 each year to pay for information, rewards, or evidence concerning violations of laws FWS administers, as well as miscellaneous and emergency expenses of enforcement activity that the Secretary of the Interior authorized or approved. NOAA generally pays rewards from moneys available in the Fisheries Enforcement Asset Forfeiture Fund. The moneys in this account come from fines, penalties, and proceeds from forfeited property for violations of marine resource laws that NOAA enforces, including the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Lacey Act. According to NOAA officials, moneys are available until expended and can be used to pay certain enforcement- related expenses, including travel expenses, equipment purchases, and the payment of financial rewards. As of the beginning of fiscal year 2017, the Fisheries Enforcement Asset Forfeiture Fund had a balance of about $18 million. Academic literature on the use of financial rewards to combat illegal activities and stakeholders we interviewed identified several advantages and disadvantages of using financial rewards to obtain information on wildlife trafficking. Potential advantages of using financial rewards include the following: Providing incentives. The potential for a financial reward can motivate people with information to come forward when they otherwise might not do so. Increasing public awareness. Financial rewards may bring greater public attention to the problem of wildlife trafficking, including federal efforts to combat wildlife trafficking. Saving resources. Using financial rewards may save agency resources by enabling agents to get information sooner and at a lower cost than they could have through their own efforts. Potential disadvantages of using financial rewards include the following: Eliciting false or unproductive leads. Financial rewards may generate false or unproductive leads. Affecting witness credibility. Financial rewards may lead to a source’s credibility being challenged at trial by defense attorneys since sources receive compensation for the information they provide. Consuming resources. The potential for a financial reward may create a flood of tips that take agency time and resources to follow up on or corroborate. Outside of wildlife trafficking, multiple federal agencies and federal courts are authorized to pay financial rewards for information on illegal activities under certain circumstances. For example, U.S. Customs and Border Protection—which controls, regulates, and facilitates the import and export of goods through U.S. ports of entry—is authorized, under certain circumstances, to pay rewards for original information about violations of any laws that it enforces. The Department of State may also pay rewards under certain circumstances, including for information leading to the disruption of financial mechanisms of a transnational criminal group. Similarly, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may pay rewards for information about violations of federal securities laws and the underpayment of taxes, respectively, if certain conditions are met. Federal judges may award money to persons who give information leading to convictions for violating treaties, laws, and regulations that prohibit certain pollution from ships, including oil and garbage discharges. FWS and NOAA officials identified multiple laws, such as the Endangered Species Act and the Lacey Act, that authorize the payment of financial rewards to people who provide information on wildlife trafficking. FWS and NOAA reported paying few financial rewards under these laws from fiscal years 2007 through 2017. However, agency officials could not provide sufficient assurance that the reward information they provided to us represented all of their reward payments for this period. FWS and NOAA officials identified over 10 laws prohibiting wildlife trafficking—including the Endangered Species Act, Lacey Act, and Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act—that specifically authorize the payment of financial rewards in certain circumstances to people who provide information on violations of the law (see app. II for a complete list of the laws). These laws provide discretion to the agencies to choose whether to pay rewards but have varying requirements for who is eligible to receive a reward and the payment amounts. For example, the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act caps rewards at $2,500 for information that leads to a conviction. In contrast, the Endangered Species Act does not cap reward amounts and authorizes rewards for information that leads to a conviction as well as to an arrest, civil penalty, or forfeiture of property. Table 1 identifies the laws that FWS and NOAA officials indicated they have used to pay financial rewards for information on wildlife trafficking from fiscal years 2007 through 2017, along with information on these laws’ requirements for payment of rewards. FWS and NOAA reported paying few financial rewards for information on wildlife trafficking from fiscal years 2007 through 2017, but agency officials could not provide sufficient assurance that this information was complete. Officials from both agencies said that their agencies have not prioritized the use of rewards, and they believed that the reward information they identified—such as the number, dollar amount, and year that rewards were paid—appropriately captured the few reward payments they made during this time frame. Based on the agencies’ reviews of their records, FWS reported paying 25 rewards for a total of $184,500 from fiscal years 2007 through 2017, and NOAA reported paying 2 rewards for a total of $21,000 during that same period (see table 2). See appendix III for additional details on the cases where financial rewards were paid. FWS reported paying rewards in trafficking cases involving a variety of wildlife species, such as eagles, bears, reptiles, and mollusks, across the 11-year period. FWS officials said they generally paid rewards to thank sources who proactively provided information. For example, based on our review of a reward case, FWS paid a reward in 2010 because the source provided information that was crucial in uncovering an attempt to illegally traffic leopards into the United States from South Africa. FWS would not have known about this illegal activity if the source had not come forward with the information. In several cases we reviewed, FWS officials said that the sources did not know about the possibility of receiving a reward when they contacted the agency with information. The two rewards NOAA reported paying from fiscal years 2007 through 2017 involved the illegal trafficking of sea scallops and a green sea turtle. NOAA officials said that in both cases they paid a reward to thank the source who proactively provided information to law enforcement agents. For example, the agent who investigated the sea scallop case reported requesting the reward because the information the source proactively provided was timely, credible, and led to the criminal conviction of several individuals. FWS and NOAA officials could not provide sufficient assurance that the reward information they reported to us represented all of the rewards their agencies had paid from fiscal years 2007 through 2017, but they said the information was complete to the best of their knowledge. Specifically, FWS and NOAA officials said they track all their expenditures, including reward payments, in their financial databases. However, they are not able to readily identify reward payments because their financial systems do not include a unique identifier for such payments and their reward information is located in multiple databases and formats. As a result, FWS and NOAA officials said they identified the rewards they reported to us by manually reviewing their financial and law enforcement records. In particular, FWS officials said they reviewed their paper records to identify instances when the agency paid rewards and then retrieved additional information from their financial and law enforcement databases, such as final payment amounts. NOAA officials said they identified instances when the agency paid rewards by using a combination of paper and electronic records located at NOAA’s headquarters office. NOAA officials also contacted their regions to obtain additional information located at the regional offices to confirm information about the rewards NOAA had paid. Seventeen stakeholders we interviewed who had experience investigating wildlife trafficking or expertise in using financial rewards as a law enforcement tool said that it would be useful for FWS and NOAA to maintain comprehensive information on the rewards they paid. For example, two stakeholders said that maintaining comprehensive information and making that information available to law enforcement agents could motivate agents to make greater use of rewards as a law enforcement tool. Two other stakeholders said that maintaining information on and monitoring reward use would allow the agencies to make ongoing adjustments, such as adjusting payment amounts, to make the most effective use of rewards in combating wildlife trafficking. Federal internal control standards say that management should clearly document internal control and all transactions and other significant events in a manner that allows the documentation to be readily available for examination. Control activities can be implemented in either an automated or a manual manner, but automated control activities tend to be more reliable because they are less susceptible to human error and are typically more efficient. FWS and NOAA officials agreed that maintaining reward information so that complete information is easily retrievable may be beneficial. FWS officials said having clearly documented and readily available reward information could improve how they manage rewards and enable them to monitor and examine their use of rewards more holistically. The officials said they may analyze options for creating a single repository for reward information but did not commit to doing so. They said that creating a single repository for reward information may involve some drawbacks, such as duplicating some data entry in separate databases. Similarly, NOAA officials said having clearly documented and readily available reward information would provide agency management with easier and more consistent access to that information. As a result, they said that they are exploring modifications to their financial and law enforcement databases to better identify and track rewards. For example, NOAA officials said they may be able to create a unique identifier to flag payments that are for rewards in their financial system to enable them to identify payment amounts more easily. NOAA officials did not provide a time frame for completing modifications to their financial system. By tracking reward information so that it is clearly documented and readily available for examination, FWS and NOAA can better ensure that they have complete information on the rewards they have paid to help manage their use of rewards as a law enforcement tool. FWS and NOAA have policies to guide their law enforcement agents on the process for preparing and submitting a request to pay a financial reward. Specifically, both agencies’ policies call for agents to include a description of the case, the nature of the information that the source provided, a justification for providing a reward, and an explanation of how a proposed reward amount was developed. These policies also outline the general review and approval process, how payments are to be made upon approval of a request, and eligibility criteria to receive a reward. For example, FWS and NOAA policies prohibit paying rewards to foreign government officials as well as paying rewards to any person whose receipt of a reward would create a conflict of interest or the appearance of impropriety. NOAA’s policy explicitly states that the NOAA Office of Law Enforcement is to use statutorily authorized rewards as a tool to obtain information from the public on resource violations and that rewards can help promote compliance with marine resource laws. NOAA’s policy suggests that agents consider advertising reward offers to assist investigations, encourages press releases, and describes the process agents should follow to do so. Moreover, NOAA’s policy specifies factors that agents might include in their reward requests to support the proposed reward, such as (1) the benefit to the marine resources that was furthered by the information provided; (2) the risk, if any, the individual took in collecting and providing the information; (3) the probability that the investigation would have been successfully concluded without the information provided; and (4) the relationship between any fines or other collections and the information provided. FWS’s policy specifies that rewards may be provided in situations in which an individual furnishes essential information leading to an arrest, conviction, civil penalty, or forfeiture of property. However, it does not discuss the usefulness of financial rewards as a law enforcement tool or the types of circumstances when rewards should be used or advertised to the public. Further, FWS’s policy does not communicate necessary quality information internally that agents may need when deciding to request the payment of rewards. In particular, it does not specify factors for agents to consider when developing proposed reward amounts. Instead, the policy leaves it to the discretion of field and regional agents to develop proposed reward amounts within any limitations specified in law. Some FWS agents we interviewed said that they developed proposed reward amounts on a case-by-case basis and did not know whether their proposed amounts were enough, too little, or too much. In addition, some agents said that because FWS’s policy does not specify factors for agents to consider, the reward approval process is subjective and unclear and this has made it challenging for the agents to develop proposed reward amounts. For example, one agent we interviewed said he submitted a request to his supervisor to pay a $10,000 reward to a source who provided information on a major wildlife trafficker. But, for reasons unknown to the agent, his supervisor reduced the amount to $1,000. FWS headquarters officials said field agents submit reward requests to headquarters for approval, and these officials were not aware of instances of proposed reward amounts being changed or denied during the review process. Seven of the 20 stakeholders we interviewed suggested that FWS augment its reward policy to specify factors for agents to consider when developing proposed reward amounts. For example, helpful factors to consider when developing a proposed reward amount may include (1) the number of hours the source dedicated to the case, (2) the risk the source took in providing the information, (3) the significance of the information provided by the source, and (4) the amount of fines or other penalties collected as a result of the information. Two stakeholders expressed concern that some of FWS’s reward payments were insufficient, especially when comparing the amount of time and effort or the risk a source faced in providing the information. A couple of stakeholders also said that without a policy that specifies factors for agents to consider, reward amounts may be subjective and could vary depending on which agent develops the reward proposal. Another stakeholder said that it was important to specify factors for agents to consider when developing proposed reward amounts so that the agency has a reasonable and defensible basis for the reward amounts it pays across cases. According to federal standards for internal control, management should internally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve an agency’s objectives. For example, management communicates quality information down and across reporting lines to enable personnel to make key decisions. FWS officials said they believe that their reward policy is sound, indicating they believe that law enforcement agents have the information they need to develop proposals for reward amounts in cases where rewards are warranted. However, they also agreed that it may be helpful to review their policy but did not commit to doing so. By augmenting its policy to specify factors for agents to consider when developing proposed reward amounts, FWS can better ensure that its agents have the necessary quality information to prepare defensible reward proposals. Based on our review of the agencies’ websites and other communications, we found that FWS and NOAA communicate little information to the public on financial rewards for reporting information on wildlife trafficking, such as the potential availability of rewards and eligibility criteria. Specifically, some FWS and NOAA law enforcement websites provided information to the public on ways to report violations of the laws that the agencies are responsible for enforcing, such as via tip lines. Some of the websites also provided examples of the types of information the public can report, such as photos or other documentation of illegal activities. However, most of the agencies’ websites did not indicate that providing information on illegal activities could result in a reward. In contrast, the FWS Alaska regional office’s website provided information on the potential availability of rewards and ways the public may submit information for a potential reward. For example, this website provided phone numbers and an e-mail address for the public to use when submitting information. Figure 1 shows the information available on FWS’s and NOAA’s national and regional websites relevant to reporting violations of the laws the agencies enforce in general and on receiving rewards in particular. In addition, FWS and NOAA headquarters officials said their field agents have used other means to communicate the potential availability of rewards in specific cases when the agents had no other information that could help solve those cases. For example, a FWS field official said that the agency advertised a reward offer for information on a case of bald eagle killings by distributing reward posters and posting news releases in the vicinity where the killings occurred. Similarly, NOAA officials said they have advertised reward offers through various means, including circulating reward posters in specific geographic areas after an illegal activity has occurred. Figure 2 shows a reward poster that NOAA distributed in Guam in 2017 advertising a $1,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of sea turtle poachers. Instead of having a plan for communicating general information to the public on rewards, FWS and NOAA grant discretion to their regional offices and law enforcement agents to determine the type and level of communication to provide, according to FWS and NOAA policies. FWS officials explained that because they typically use financial rewards to thank individuals who come forward on their own accord—rather than using rewards to incentivize individuals with information to come forward—they have not seen the need to communicate more information to the public on the potential availability of rewards. NOAA officials said they have targeted their communications on rewards by publicizing reward offers for specific cases where they do not have leads. They added that they want to receive quality information and already receive a substantial amount of information from sources who reach out to them proactively, so NOAA has not seen the need to communicate more information to the public on the potential availability of rewards. Sixteen of the 20 stakeholders we interviewed said that it would be useful for FWS and NOAA to advertise the potential availability of financial rewards. Several stakeholders said that if the public does not know about the possibility for rewards, then some people with information may not be incentivized to come forward. Two stakeholders added that agencies should carefully consider how and which reward information to communicate to the public so that people who are most likely to have information on illegal wildlife trafficking learn about the potential for rewards. For example, one stakeholder suggested advertising rewards at ports where international shipments are offloaded or placing advertisements at wildlife trafficking nodes, such as entrances to African wildlife refuges. This stakeholder suggested advertising rewards along with wildlife trafficking awareness-raising posters that nongovernment organizations place in some airports. In addition, 14 stakeholders suggested that it would be useful for FWS and NOAA to provide information to the public on the process for submitting information to potentially receive rewards. Several other stakeholders said that it is important for the public to understand whether they may be eligible for a reward, how to submit information, and whether or to what extent their confidentiality will be protected. Another stakeholder provided examples of how other agencies provide information about their reward programs on their websites. SEC and IRS, for instance, use their websites to communicate information to the public on the process for reporting illegal activity for financial rewards. This information includes the types of information to report, confidentiality rules, eligibility criteria, and the process for submitting information to obtain a reward. In addition, the Department of State posts instructions on its websites on how to submit information on an illegal activity and potentially receive a reward. Federal internal control standards say that management should externally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve an agency’s objectives. For example, using appropriate methods to communicate, management communicates quality information so that external parties, such as the public, can help the agency achieve its objectives. This could include communicating information to the public on the types of information and eligibility requirements for potentially receiving rewards for reporting information on wildlife trafficking. FWS officials said that making more reward information available could lead to a significant increase in the amount of information the agency receives, which, in turn, could strain FWS’s resources in following up on that information. However, FWS officials also agreed that it was reasonable to consider making more reward information available to relevant members of the public, particularly in targeted circumstances, but did not commit to doing so. Similarly, NOAA officials said they had some concerns about the additional resources it might take to investigate potentially unreliable or false tips that may result if they make reward information broadly available to the public, but they agreed that it would be reasonable for the agency to consider doing so. NOAA officials also said they may consider making more reward information publicly available at the conclusion of our audit but provided no plans for doing so. By determining the types of additional information to communicate to the public on rewards—such as providing information on the agency’s website on the potential availability of rewards—and then developing and implementing plans to do so, FWS and NOAA can improve their chances of obtaining information on wildlife trafficking activities that they otherwise might not receive. FWS and NOAA have not reviewed the effectiveness of their use of financial rewards or considered whether any changes might improve the usefulness of rewards as a tool for combating wildlife trafficking. FWS officials said their agency has not reviewed or considered changes to its use of rewards because the agency has not prioritized the use of rewards. NOAA officials said their agency has not focused on using rewards or identified the need to review its use of this tool, particularly in light of other, higher mission priorities. Nine of the 20 stakeholders we interviewed said that FWS and NOAA should review the effectiveness of their use of rewards and consider potential improvements. Several stakeholders said that it would be useful for FWS and NOAA to compare their respective approaches to those of federal agencies that use rewards in contexts outside of wildlife trafficking to identify best practices or lessons learned that might be applicable in the context of combating wildlife trafficking. For example, one stakeholder said that SEC has an effective whistleblower program and may have lessons learned that are relevant for FWS and NOAA to consider. Another stakeholder we interviewed separately indicated that in 2010, before SEC had a whistleblower program that publicized rewards and provided detailed instructions on how members of the public could report information on illegal activities, SEC received few tips. Once SEC implemented a whistleblower program that publicized rewards and provided detailed instructions on its public website, the agency’s use of the program grew substantially, according to the stakeholder. Other stakeholders said it would be useful for the agencies to consider potential improvements to their use of rewards, such as making a standing reward offer for information on wildlife trafficking targeted at high-priority endangered species or particular criminal networks. Two of these stakeholders said such an offer might improve FWS’s and NOAA’s use of rewards by generating more tips than reward offers focused on individual cases. At the same time, they said such an offer would likely filter out some of the false or unproductive tips that the agencies might receive if they made an untargeted standing reward offer. Federal internal control standards state that management should design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks by, for example, conducting reviews at the functional or activity level by comparing actual performance to planned or expected results and analyzing significant differences. Further, under the standards, management should periodically review policies, procedures, and related control activities for continued relevance and effectiveness in achieving an agency’s objectives or addressing related risks. FWS and NOAA officials agreed that reviewing the effectiveness of their use of rewards would be worthwhile. Specifically, FWS officials said that it would be useful to compare their approach to those of other federal agencies that use rewards in investigating crimes that involve interstate and foreign smuggling of goods. Similarly, NOAA officials said that reviewing the agency’s use of financial rewards would be worthwhile but cautioned that such a review would need to be balanced against the agency’s constrained resources and many mission requirements. FWS and NOAA officials said they may consider conducting such a review at the conclusion of our audit but provided no plans for doing so. By reviewing the effectiveness of their use of rewards, FWS and NOAA can identify opportunities to improve the usefulness of rewards as a tool for combating wildlife trafficking. Wildlife trafficking is a large and growing transnational criminal activity, with global environmental, security, and economic consequences. The federal government has emphasized strengthening law enforcement efforts to combat wildlife trafficking, and using financial rewards to obtain information on illegal activities is one tool that some federal agencies have used. However, to date, FWS and NOAA have not prioritized the use of rewards and were unable to provide sufficient assurance that the 27 rewards they paid during fiscal years 2007 through 2017 represented all of the rewards they provided during that period. By tracking reward information so that it is clearly documented and readily available for examination, FWS and NOAA can better ensure that they have complete information on the rewards they have paid to help manage their use of rewards as a law enforcement tool. Additionally, FWS and NOAA have policies outlining the processes their law enforcement agents are to use in making reward payments, and NOAA’s policy specifies factors for its agents to consider in developing proposed reward amounts, such as the risk the individual took in collecting the information. FWS’s policy does not specify such factors that could inform agents in achieving the agency’s objectives, which is not consistent with federal internal control standards. By augmenting its policy to specify factors for its agents to consider when developing proposed reward amounts, FWS can better ensure that its agents have the necessary quality information to prepare defensible reward proposals. Both agencies have also advertised the potential for rewards in specific cases when agents had no other information, but FWS and NOAA have otherwise communicated little information to the public on the potential availability of rewards. If the public does not know about the possibility of rewards, then some people with information may not be incentivized to come forward. By determining the types of additional information to communicate to the public on rewards—such as providing information on the agency’s website about the potential availability of rewards—and then developing and implementing plans to do so, FWS and NOAA can improve their chances of obtaining information on wildlife trafficking activities that they otherwise might not receive. Finally, FWS and NOAA have not reviewed the effectiveness of their use of financial rewards or considered whether any changes might improve the usefulness of rewards as a law enforcement tool. By undertaking such reviews, the agencies can identify opportunities to improve the usefulness of rewards as a tool for combating wildlife trafficking. We are making a total of seven recommendations, including four to FWS and three to NOAA. Specifically: The Assistant Director of the FWS Office of Law Enforcement should track financial reward information so that it is clearly documented and readily available for examination. (Recommendation 1) The Director of the NOAA Office of Law Enforcement should track financial reward information so that it is clearly documented and readily available for examination. (Recommendation 2) The Assistant Director of the FWS Office of Law Enforcement should augment FWS’s financial reward policy to specify factors law enforcement agents are to consider when developing proposed reward amounts. (Recommendation 3) The Assistant Director of the FWS Office of Law Enforcement should determine the types of additional information to communicate to the public on financial rewards and then develop and implement a plan for communicating that information. (Recommendation 4) The Director of the NOAA Office of Law Enforcement should determine the types of additional information to communicate to the public on financial rewards and then develop and implement a plan for communicating that information. (Recommendation 5) The Assistant Director of the FWS Office of Law Enforcement should review the effectiveness of the agency’s use of financial rewards and implement any changes that the agency determines would improve the usefulness of financial rewards as a law enforcement tool. (Recommendation 6) The Director of the NOAA Office of Law Enforcement should review the effectiveness of the agency’s use of financial rewards and implement any changes that the agency determines would improve the usefulness of financial rewards as a law enforcement tool. (Recommendation 7) We provided a draft of this report for review and comment to the Departments of Commerce and the Interior. The departments transmitted written comments, which are reproduced in appendixes IV and V of this report. The Department of Commerce concurred with the three recommendations directed to NOAA and stated that NOAA is developing procedures to ensure that its rewards are closely tracked, clearly documented, and better communicated. In written comments from NOAA, NOAA stated the report fairly and thoroughly reviews NOAA’s use of financial rewards. NOAA outlined the steps it plans to take in response to our recommendations, including developing a procedure to track financial reward information, reviewing information currently disseminated to the public and evaluating whether additional information may be useful, and reviewing the agency’s reward policy to determine whether changes are needed to enhance reward effectiveness. In its written comments, the Department of the Interior concurred with the four recommendations directed to FWS. Interior stated that it appreciated our review of the challenges faced by FWS’s Office of Law Enforcement in combating wildlife trafficking and identifying areas where FWS and NOAA can improve the use of financial rewards as a tool for combating wildlife trafficking. Interior also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior, and other interested parties. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-3841 or fennella@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and of Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made major contributions to this report are listed in appendix VI. The objectives of our review were to (1) identify laws that authorize the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to pay financial rewards for information on wildlife trafficking and the extent to which these agencies paid such rewards from fiscal years 2007 through 2017, (2) evaluate FWS’s and NOAA’s policies on financial rewards, (3) evaluate the information available to the public on financial rewards, and (4) determine the extent to which FWS and NOAA reviewed the effectiveness of their use of financial rewards in combating wildlife trafficking. To address these objectives, we reviewed academic literature on the use of financial rewards to combat illegal activities and United Nations Environment Programme reports on the scope and scale of wildlife trafficking. We also interviewed officials from federal agencies that play a role in combating wildlife trafficking or manage programs that pay financial rewards for information on illegal activities. Specifically, we interviewed officials from the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Homeland Security, the Interior, Justice, and State, as well as officials from the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the U.S. Agency for International Development. In addition, we reviewed documentation that the Department of the Treasury provided on its role in paying financial rewards. We did not compare FWS’s and NOAA’s use of financial rewards in combating wildlife trafficking to federal agencies’ use of financial rewards in other contexts because the different contexts are not directly comparable. However, we reviewed information on other federal agencies’ use of financial rewards as examples of how financial rewards are used in contexts outside of wildlife trafficking. In addition, we interviewed representatives of six nongovernmental organizations that we selected based on those organizations’ knowledge or experience in combating wildlife trafficking. Specifically, we interviewed representatives from the Elephant Action League, the Environmental Investigation Agency, the National Association of Conservation Law Enforcement Chiefs, the National Whistleblower Center, TRAFFIC, and the World Wildlife Fund. To identify laws that authorize FWS and NOAA to pay financial rewards for information on wildlife trafficking, we asked FWS and NOAA attorneys to compile a list of laws that each of their agencies implements or enforces that prohibit wildlife trafficking and authorize the agency to pay rewards for providing information about trafficking. We then compared that list to the results of our search of the United States Code for such laws. We also reviewed FWS and NOAA documentation for accounts where the fines, penalties, and proceeds from forfeited property that are used to pay rewards are deposited as well as the accounts where appropriations available to pay rewards were deposited. To identify the extent to which FWS and NOAA have paid financial rewards for information on wildlife trafficking, we analyzed FWS and NOAA data on financial rewards the agencies reported paying from fiscal years 2007 through 2017. The data included information on, among other things, the fiscal years in which rewards were paid, laws under which rewards were paid, types of wildlife involved in those cases, the amounts of civil penalties or criminal fines imposed in those cases, the numbers of arrests and convictions as a result of those cases, and whether reward recipients were individuals or groups and U.S. or foreign citizens. To assess the reliability of the data FWS and NOAA provided on financial rewards, we interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about the data and compared the data to case records the agencies provided. Specifically, FWS and NOAA officials said they track all expenditures, including reward payments, in their financial databases, but they are not able to readily identify reward payments because their financial systems do not include a unique identifier for such payments and their reward information is located in multiple databases and formats. As a result, FWS and NOAA officials said they identified the rewards that they reported to us by manually reviewing their financial and law enforcement records, and officials said the information was complete to the best of their knowledge. Based on these steps, we found the data that the agencies provided to us to be sufficiently reliable for reporting information on the rewards the agencies reported paying. However, as we discuss in the report, FWS and NOAA officials could not provide sufficient assurance that the data included all the financial rewards that they had paid from fiscal years 2007 through 2017. To obtain additional detail about cases where financial rewards were paid, we reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 10 wildlife trafficking cases. We selected these cases based on the agency that investigated the case (to include both FWS and NOAA cases), the amount of the reward paid in the case (to reflect both low and high amounts), the year in which the reward was paid (to include rewards paid more recently), and the type of wildlife trafficked in the case (to include both fish and wildlife cases—there were no plant trafficking cases to select). While the findings from our review cannot be generalized to cases we did not select and review, they illustrate how FWS and NOAA have used financial rewards in wildlife trafficking cases. To evaluate FWS and NOAA policies on financial rewards, we reviewed relevant FWS and NOAA policies and compared them to each other; interviewed FWS and NOAA officials about those policies; and compared the information in the policies with federal internal control standards on information and communication. To evaluate information available to the public on rewards, we reviewed relevant FWS and NOAA publications and examples of communications to the public on the availability of rewards in specific cases and interviewed FWS and NOAA officials. We also reviewed information available on FWS’s and NOAA’s national and regional websites as of December 2017 and January 2018, respectively, relevant to reporting violations of the laws that the agencies enforce in general and on receiving rewards in particular. We compared the agencies’ public communications on rewards with federal internal control standards on information and communication. To evaluate the extent to which FWS and NOAA reviewed the effectiveness of their use of financial rewards in combating wildlife trafficking, we interviewed FWS and NOAA officials and requested any reviews the agencies had conducted regarding their use of financial rewards to compare with federal internal control standards on control activities. FWS and NOAA did not have any such reviews to provide. In addition, for all four objectives, we interviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 20 stakeholders who had experience investigating wildlife trafficking or expertise in the use of financial rewards as a law enforcement tool. To select stakeholders to interview, we first identified a list of stakeholders by reviewing (1) FWS and NOAA data on law enforcement agents with at least 5 years of experience who had investigated wildlife trafficking cases and used financial rewards, (2) Department of Justice data on federal prosecutors who had prosecuted wildlife trafficking cases since fiscal year 2014, (3) literature search results identifying academics with expertise in the use of financial rewards as a law enforcement tool and federal programs that use financial rewards to combat illegal activities in contexts outside of wildlife trafficking, (4) the biographies of members of the federal Advisory Council on Wildlife Trafficking, and (5) recommendations from stakeholders we interviewed. From this list, we then used a multistep process to select the 20 stakeholders to interview. To ensure coverage and a range of perspectives, we selected stakeholders from the following groups: FWS and NOAA law enforcement agents, including field and federal prosecutors responsible for prosecuting wildlife trafficking cases; federal officials responsible for programs that use financial rewards to combat illegal activities in contexts outside of wildlife trafficking; academics with expertise in the use of financial rewards as a law members of the federal Advisory Council on Wildlife Trafficking; and representatives of nongovernmental organizations that investigate wildlife trafficking. We conducted semistructured interviews with the 20 selected stakeholders using a standard set of questions. We asked questions about stakeholder views on the usefulness of financial rewards in combating wildlife trafficking; the strength and weaknesses of the statutory provisions that authorize federal agencies to pay financial rewards for information on wildlife trafficking; FWS’s and NOAA’s use of financial rewards to combat wildlife trafficking; and how, if at all, the two agencies could improve their use of financial rewards to combat wildlife trafficking. We analyzed the stakeholders’ responses to our questions, grouping the responses into overall themes. We summarized the results of our analysis and then shared the summary with relevant FWS and NOAA officials to obtain their views. Views from these stakeholders cannot be generalized to those whom we did not select and interview. We conducted this performance audit from February 2017 to April 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. The Department of the Interior’s U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) implement or enforce multiple laws that specifically authorize the payment, under specified circumstances, of financial rewards to persons for information about violations of laws that prohibit wildlife trafficking. The laws that FWS officials identified are listed and summarized in table 3, and the laws that NOAA officials identified are listed and summarized in table 4. In addition, as noted above, the reward provisions in the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act as amended and the Fish and Wildlife Improvement Act as amended authorize the payment of rewards for information about violations of multiple laws. Specifically, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act as amended authorizes the payment of rewards for information about violations of the act as well as any other marine resource law that the Secretary of Commerce enforces. Further, the Fish and Wildlife Improvement Act as amended authorizes the payment of rewards for information about violations of any law administered by NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service relating to plants, fish, or wildlife. NOAA officials identified 14 such laws that prohibit wildlife trafficking (see table 5). If a violation of the laws listed in table 5 occurs, NOAA officials said they could use the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act or Fish and Wildlife Improvement Act reward provision to pay a reward for information on the violation. None of the laws listed in table 5 specifically authorize the payment of financial rewards. Table 6 provides information on U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration cases where these agencies reported paying rewards for information on wildlife trafficking from fiscal years 2007 through 2017. In addition to the contact named above, Alyssa M. Hundrup (Assistant Director), David Marroni (Analyst-in-Charge), Cindy Gilbert, Keesha Luebke, Jeanette Soares, Sheryl Stein, Sara Sullivan, and Judith Williams made key contributions to this report.\n\n","[""Wildlife trafficking—the poaching and illegal trade of plants, fish, and wildlife—is a multibillion-dollar, global criminal activity that imperils thousands of species. FWS and NOAA enforce laws prohibiting wildlife trafficking that authorize the agencies to pay financial rewards for information about such illegal activities. GAO was asked to review FWS's and NOAA's use of financial rewards to combat wildlife trafficking. This report examines (1) laws that authorize FWS and NOAA to pay rewards for information on wildlife trafficking and the extent to which the agencies paid such rewards from fiscal years 2007 through 2017, (2) the agencies' reward policies, (3) information available to the public on rewards, and (4) the extent to which the agencies reviewed the effectiveness of their use of rewards. GAO reviewed laws, examined FWS and NOAA policies and public communications on rewards, analyzed agency reward data for fiscal years 2007 through 2017 and assessed their reliability, interviewed FWS and NOAA officials, and compared agency policies and public communications on rewards to federal internal control standards. Multiple laws—such as the Endangered Species Act and Lacey Act—authorize the Departments of the Interior's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to pay rewards for information on wildlife trafficking. FWS and NOAA reported paying few rewards from fiscal years 2007 through 2017. Specifically, the agencies collectively reported paying 27 rewards, totaling $205,500. Agency officials said that the information was complete to the best of their knowledge but could not sufficiently assure that this information represented all of their reward payments. FWS and NOAA have reward policies that outline the general process for preparing reward proposals, but FWS's policy does not specify factors for its agents to consider when developing proposed reward amounts. Some FWS agents GAO interviewed said that in developing proposals, they did not know whether their proposed reward amounts were enough, too little, or too much. By augmenting its policy to specify factors for agents to consider, FWS can better ensure that its agents have the necessary quality information to prepare proposed reward amounts, consistent with federal internal control standards. FWS and NOAA communicate little information to the public on rewards. For example, most agency websites did not indicate that providing information on wildlife trafficking could qualify for a reward. This is inconsistent with federal standards that call for management to communicate quality information so that external parties can help achieve agency objectives. FWS and NOAA officials said they have not communicated general reward information because of workload concerns, but they said it may be reasonable to provide more information in some instances. By developing plans to communicate more reward information to the public, the agencies can improve their chances of obtaining information on wildlife trafficking that they otherwise might not receive. FWS and NOAA have not reviewed the effectiveness of their use of rewards. The agencies have not done so because using rewards has generally not been a priority. FWS and NOAA officials agreed that such a review would be worthwhile but provided no plans for doing so. By reviewing the effectiveness of their use of rewards, FWS and NOAA can identify opportunities to improve the usefulness of rewards as a tool for combating wildlife trafficking. GAO is making seven recommendations, including that FWS and NOAA track reward information, FWS augment its reward policy to specify factors for agents to consider when developing proposed reward amounts, FWS and NOAA develop plans to communicate more reward information to the public, and FWS and NOAA review the effectiveness of their reward use. Both agencies concurred with these recommendations.""]","8129","gov_report","en","None","cbc3f7193f9fa873108c6ccc73a558eb1d2a97b249a1f930","Summary:","gov_report","532","\n\nThe United Nations, United States, and other countries have been facing a significant issue of wildlife trafficking, which has led to a rise in environmental crime and security and economic consequences.

The report highlights the need for these agencies to track and communicate the financial reward information more effectively, and to review the effectiveness of their use of financial rewards in combating wildlife trafficking.

Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nCross-border data flows underlie today's globally connected world and are essential to conducting international trade and commerce. Data flows enable companies to transmit information for online communication, track global supply chains, share research, and provide cross-border services. One study estimates that digital commerce relying on data flows drives 22% of global economic output, and that global GDP will increase by another $2 trillion by 2020 due to advances in emerging technologies. However, while cross-border data flows increase productivity and enable innovation, they also raise concerns around the security and privacy of the information being transmitted. Cross-border data flows are central to trade and trade negotiations as organizations rely on the transmission of information to use cloud services, and to send nonpersonal corporate data as well as personal data to partners, subsidiaries, and customers. U.S. policymakers are considering various policy options to address online privacy, some of which could affect cross-border data flows. For example, new consumer rights to control their personal data may impact how companies can use such data. To enable international data flows and trade, the United States has aimed to eliminate trade barriers and establish enforceable international rules and best practices that allow policymakers to achieve public policy objectives, including promoting online security and privacy. Building consensus for international rules and norms on data flows and privacy has become increasingly important as recent incidents have heightened the public's awareness of the risk of personal data stored online. For example, the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal drew attention because the firm reportedly acquired and used data on more than 87 million Facebook accounts in an effort to influence voters in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the UK referendum on continued European Union (EU) membership (""Brexit""). In addition, security concerns have been raised about data breaches, such as those that exposed the personal data of half a million Google users or 500 million Marriot hotel customers. Organizations value consumers' personal online data for a variety of reasons. For example, companies may seek to facilitate business transactions, analyze marketing information, detect disease patterns from medical histories, discover fraudulent payments, improve proprietary algorithms, or develop competitive innovations. Some analysts compare data to oil or gold, but unlike those valuable substances, data can be reused, analyzed, shared, and combined with other information; it is not a scarce resource. However, personal data is considered personal private property. Individuals often want to control who accesses their data and how it is used. Experts suggest that data may therefore be considered both a benefit and a liability that organizations hold. Data has value, but an organization takes on risk by collecting personal data; they become responsible for protecting users' privacy and not misusing the information. Data privacy concerns may become more urgent as the amount of online information organizations access and collect, and the level of global data flows, continue to expand. Countries vary in their policies and laws on these issues. The United States has traditionally supported open data flows and has regulated privacy at a sectoral level to cover data, such as health records, rather than create a comprehensive policy. U.S. trade policy has sought to balance the goals of consumer privacy, security, and open commerce, including eliminating trade barriers and opening markets. Other countries are developing data privacy policies that affect international trade as some governments or groups seek to limit data flows outside of an organization or across national borders for a number of reasons. Blocking international data flows may impede the ability of a firm to do business or of an individual to conduct a transaction, creating a form of trade protectionism. Research demonstrates not only the economic gains from digital trade and international data flows, but also the real economic costs of restrictions on such flows. For many policymakers, the crux of the issue is: How can governments protect individual privacy in the least trade-restrictive way possible? The question is similar to concerns raised about ensuring cybersecurity while allowing the free flow of data. In recent years, Congress has examined multiple issues related to cross-border data flows and online privacy. In the 115 th Congress, congressional committees held hearings on these topics, introduced multiple bills, and conducted oversight over federal laws on related issues such as data breach notification. Members are introducing new bills and holding hearings in the 116 th Congress. Congress may consider the proposed U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and examine the digital trade chapter as an example of how to address the issues through trade agreements. In most circumstances, a consumer expects both privacy and security when conducting an online transaction. However, users' expectations and values may vary and there is no globally accepted standard or definition of data privacy in the online world. In addressing online privacy, Congress may need to define personal data and differentiate between sensitive and nonsensitive personal data. In general, data privacy can be defined by an individual's ability to prevent access to personally identifiable information (PII). According to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance to federal agencies, PII refers to information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, either alone or when combined with other information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual. Since electronic data can be readily shared and combined, some data not traditionally considered PII may have become more sensitive. For example, the OMB definition does not specifically mention data on location tracking, purchase history, o r preferences, but these digital data points can be tracked by a device such as a mobile phone or laptop that an individual carries or logs into. The EU definition of PII attempts to capture the breadth of data available in the online world: ""personal data"" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. Policymakers may consider differentiating between sensitive and nonsensitive personal data. For example, sensitive personal data could include ethnic origin, political or religious affiliation, biometric data, health data, sexual orientation, precise geolocation data, etc. ""Cross-border data flows"" refers to the movement or transfer of information between computer servers across national borders. Cross-border data flows are part of, and integral to, digital trade and facilitate the movement of goods, services, people, and finance. A 2017 analysis estimated that global flows of goods, services, finance, and people increased world gross domestic product (GDP) by at least 10% in the past decade, adding $8 trillion between 2005 and 2015. Effective and sustainable digital trade relies on data flows that permit commerce and communication but that also ensure privacy and security, protect intellectual property, and build trust and confidence. Impeding cross-border data flows, including through some privacy regulations, may decrease efficiency and reduce other benefits of digital trade, resulting in the fracturing, or so-called balkanization, of the internet. In addressing online privacy, some policymakers focus on limiting access to online information by restricting the flow of data beyond a country's borders. Such limits may also act as protectionist measures. Online privacy policies may create barriers to digital trade, or damage trust in the underlying digital economy. For example, measures to limit cross-border data flows could block companies from using cloud computing to aggregate and analyze global data, or from gaining economies of scale, constrain e-commerce by limiting international online payments, hinder global supply chains seeking to use blockchain to track products or manage supply chains, customs documentation, or electronic payments, impede the trading of crypto-currency, or limit the use of advanced technology like artificial intelligence. According to the World Trade Organization (WTO), one of the most significant overall impacts of the growth of digital technologies is in transforming international trade. Technology can lower the costs of trade, change the types of goods and services that are traded, and may even change the factors defining a country's comparative advantage. The extent of the impact of digital technologies on trade, however, depends in large part on open cross-border data flows. One study of U.S. companies found that data localization rules (i.e., requiring organizations to store data on local servers) were the most-cited digital trade barrier. Some governments advocate privacy or security policies that require data localization and limit cross-border data flows. However, many industry stakeholders argue that blocking cross-border data flows and storing data domestically does not make such data more secure or private. Many experts argue that policymakers should limit cross-border data flows in the least trade-restrictive manner possible and also ensure security and privacy. These objectives are not easily reconciled. Moreover, although an overlap exists between data protection and privacy, the two are not equivalent. Cybersecurity measures are essential to protect data (e.g., against intrusions or theft by hackers). However, they may not be sufficient to protect privacy. For example, if an organization shares user data with a third party, it may be doing so securely, but not in a way that protects users' privacy or aligns with consumer expectations. Similarly, breach notification requirements are not the same as proactive privacy protection measures. At the same time, policies that protect a consumer's privacy can align with security policies. Laws can limit law enforcement's access to information except in certain circumstances. Keeping user information anonymous may enable firms to analyze data while protecting individuals' identities. Some see an inherent conflict between online security, privacy, and trade; others believe that policies protecting all three can be coherent and consistent. The U.S. government has traditionally sought to balance these objectives. Some stakeholders note, however, that current U.S. policy has been inadequate in protecting online privacy and that change is needed. In some cases in the past, Congress has acted to address privacy concerns in particular sectors; for example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 led to health privacy standards regulations. The Trump Administration has begun an effort to devise an overarching data privacy policy (see "" Defining the U.S. Approach "") and many Members of Congress are also considering possible approaches. There are no comprehensive multilateral rules specifically about privacy or cross-border data flows. However, the United States and other countries have begun to address these issues in negotiating new and updated trade agreements, and through international economic forums and organizations such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The World Trade Organization (WTO) General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) entered into force in January 1995, predating the current reach of the internet and the explosive growth of global data flows. Many digital products and services that did not exist when the agreements were negotiated are not covered. On the other hand, privacy is explicitly addressed within GATS as an exception to allow countries to take measures that do not conform with the agreement in order to protect ""the privacy of individuals in relation to the processing and dissemination of personal data and the protection of confidentiality of individual records and accounts,"" as long as those measures are not arbitrary or a disguised trade restriction. Efforts to update the multilateral agreement and discussions for new digital trade rules under the WTO Electronic Commerce Work Program stalled in 2017. Given the lack of progress on multilateral rules, some have suggested that the WTO should identify best practices or guidelines for digital trade rules that could lay the foundation for a future multilateral WTO agreement. In December 2017, a group of more than 70 WTO members, including the United States, agreed to ""initiate exploratory work together toward future WTO negotiations on trade-related aspects of electronic commerce."" Overall U.S. objectives include allowing the free flow of information for international trade and cross-border data flows, ""subject to reasonable safeguards like the protection of consumer data when it is exported,"" but do not specifically address privacy. The group formally launched the e-commerce initiative in January 2019. The official joint statement lists the United States and EU as participants, and also several developing countries such as China and Brazil. India stated it will not join, preferring to maintain its flexibility to favor domestic firms, limit foreign market access, and raise revenue in the future. The statement did not define the scope of any potential agreement. After the meeting, the EU noted data localization measures among the potential new rules to be discussed when negotiations officially launch in March 2019. The U.S. Trade Representative's (USTR's) statement emphasized the need for a high-standard agreement that includes enforceable obligations. Although some experts note that harmonization or mutual recognition is unlikely given divergent legal systems, privacy regimes, and norms of the parties, a common system of rules to allow for cross-border data flows while ensuring privacy protection is reportedly under discussion. Personal privacy has received increasing focus with the growth of digital trade encouraging global cooperation. The United States has contributed to developing international guidelines or principles related to privacy and cross-border data flows, although none are legally binding. The OECD 1980 Privacy Guidelines established the first international set of privacy principles emphasizing data protection as a condition for the free flow of personal data across borders. These OECD guidelines were intended to assist countries with drawing up national data privacy policies. The guidelines were updated in 2013, focusing on national level implementation based on a risk management approach and improving interoperability between national privacy strategies. The updated guidelines identify specific principles for countries to take into account in establishing national policies. The guidelines are to be reviewed and updated again in 2019. Building on the OECD principles and prior G-20 work, the 2018 G-20 Digital Economy Ministerial Declaration identified principles to ""facilitate an inclusive and whole-of-government approach to the use of information and communication technology (ICT) and assist governments in reshaping their capacities and strategies, while respecting the applicable frameworks of different countries, including with regards to privacy and data protection."" Japan is to host the 2019 G-20 and plans to focus on data governance, offering a forum to address potential global standards on privacy and cross-border data flows. APEC is a regional forum for economic cooperation whose initiatives on privacy and cross-border data flows have influenced members' domestic policies. APEC's 21 members, including the United States, agreed to the 2005 APEC Privacy Framework , based on the OECD guidelines. The framework identifies a set of principles and implementation guidelines to provide members with a flexible approach to regulate privacy at a national level. Once the OECD publishes updated guidelines in 2019, APEC members may revise the framework and principles to reflect the updated guidelines. The APEC Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPR), endorsed by APEC Leaders in 2011, is a privacy code of conduct, based on the framework. The CBPR system establishes a set of principles for governments and businesses to follow to protect personal data and allow for cross-border data flows between CBPR members. They aim to balance information privacy with business needs and commercial interests, and facilitate digital trade to spur economic growth in the region. Rather than creating a new set of international regulations, the APEC framework and CBPR system identify best practices that each APEC member can tailor to its domestic legal system and allow for interoperability between countries. The scope and implementation mechanisms under CBPR can vary according to each member country's laws and regulations, providing flexibility for governments to design national privacy approaches. To become a member of the CBPR, a government must 1. Be a member of APEC; 2. Establish a regulator with authority to sign the Cross-Border Privacy Enforcement Arrangement (CPEA); 3. Map national laws to the published APEC guidelines, which set baseline standards; and 4. Establish an accountability agent empowered to audit and review a company's practices, and enforce privacy rules and laws. If a government joins the CBPR system, every domestic organization is not required to also join; however, becoming a member of CBPR may benefit an organization engaged in international trade by indicating to customers and partners that the organization values and protects data privacy. With certified enrollment in CBPR, organizations can transfer personal information between participating economies (e.g., Mexico to Singapore) and be assured of compliance with the legal regimes in both places. To become a CBPR member, an individual organization must develop and implement data privacy policies consistent with the APEC Privacy Framework and complete a questionnaire. The third party accountability agent is responsible for assessing an organization's application, ongoing monitoring of compliance, investigating any complaints, and taking enforcement actions as necessary. Domestic enforcement authorities in each member country serve as a backstop for dispute resolution if an accountability agent cannot resolve a particular issue. All CBPR member governments must join the CPEA to ensure cooperation and collaboration between the designated national enforcement authorities. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the regulator and enforcement authority. TrustArc is the only accountability agent, but many expect the U.S. Department of Commerce to recognize additional agents soon. As of this writing, TrustArc lists about 20 U.S. firms that are APEC CBPR certified. The CBPR grows in significance as the number of participating economies and organizations increases. The U.S. ambassador to APEC aims to have ""as many APEC economies as possible as soon as possible to join the system."" Currently, the United States, Japan, Mexico, Canada, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Australia are CBPR members; the Philippines is in the process of joining. Russia, on the other hand, stated it has no plans to join. Although APEC initiatives are regionally focused, they can provide a basis to scale up to larger global efforts because they reflect economies at different stages of development and include industry participation. Due to its voluntary nature, APEC has served as a testbed for identifying best practices, standards, and principles and for creating frameworks that can lead to binding commitments in plurilateral or larger multilateral agreements (see "" Data Flows and Privacy in U.S. Trade Agreements ""). Expanding CBPR beyond APEC could represent the next step toward consistent international rules and disciplines on data flows and privacy. Countries vary in their privacy policies and laws, reflecting differing priorities, cultures, and legal structures. According to one index, China is the most restrictive digital trade country among 64 countries surveyed, followed by Russia, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam (see Figure 1 ). The United States ranks 22 in the index, less restrictive than Brazil or France but more restrictive than Canada or Australia. The relatively high U.S. score largely reflects financial sector restrictions. The ""restrictions on data"" category covers data policies such as privacy and security measures; this category is included in the composite index. Looking specifically at the 64 countries' data policies, Russia is the most restrictive country, followed by Turkey and China. Russia's policies include data localization, retention, and transfer requirements, among others. Turkey's comprehensive Data Protection Law also establishes requirements in these areas. In contrast, the United States ranks 50 for data policy restrictions. Two of the top U.S. trading partners (the EU and China) have established their data policies from different perspectives. The EU's policies are driven by privacy concerns; China's policies are based on security justifications. Both are setting examples that other countries, especially those with (or seeking) closer trading ties to China or the EU, are emulating; thus, these policies have affected U.S. firms seeking to do business in those other countries as well. The EU considers the privacy of communications and the protection of personal data to be fundamental human rights, which are codified in EU law. Differences between the United States and EU in their approaches to data protection and data privacy laws have long been sticking points in U.S.-EU economic and security relations. The EU and United States negotiated the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield to allow for the transatlantic transfer of personal data by certified organizations. The bilateral agreement established a voluntary program with commitments and obligations for companies, limitations on law enforcement access, and transparency requirements. U.S. companies that participate in the program must still comply with all of the obligations under EU law (see below) if they process personal data of EU persons. The Privacy Shield is overseen and enforced by EU federal and U.S. agencies, including the Department of Commerce and the FTC, and is reviewed by both parties annually. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), effective May 2018, establishes rules for EU members, with extraterritorial implications. The GDPR is a comprehensive privacy regime that builds on previous EU data protection rules. It grants new rights to individuals to control personal data and creates specific new data protection requirements. The GDPR applies to (1) all businesses and organizations with an EU establishment that process (i.e., perform operations on) personal data of individuals in the EU, regardless of where the actual processing of the data takes place; and (2) entities outside the EU that offer goods or services (for payment or for free) to individuals in the EU or monitor the behavior of individuals in the EU. While the GDPR is directly applicable at the EU member state level, individual countries are responsible for establishing some national-level rules and policies as well as enforcement authorities, and some are still in the process of doing so. As a result, some U.S. stakeholders have voiced concerns about a lack of clarity and inadequate country compliance guidelines. Many U.S. firms doing business in the EU have made and are making changes to comply with the GDPR, such as revising and clarifying user terms of agreement and asking for explicit consent. For some U.S. companies, it may be easier and cheaper to apply GDPR protections to all users worldwide rather than to maintain different policies for different users. Large firms may have the resources to hire consultants and lawyers to guide implementation and compliance; it may be harder and costlier for small and mid-sized enterprises to comply, possibly deterring them from entering the EU market and creating a de facto trade barrier. Since the GDPR went into effect on May 25, 2018, some U.S. businesses, including some newspaper websites and digital advertising firms, have opted to exit the EU market given the complexities of complying with the GDPR and the threat of potential enforcement actions. European Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) have received a range of GDPR complaints and initiated several GDPR enforcement actions in the fall of 2018. In January 2019, the French DPA issued the largest penalty to date for a data privacy breach. The agency imposed a €50 million (approximately $57 million) fine on Google for the ""lack of transparency"" regarding how the search engine processes user data. Analysts contend that the high fine may set a benchmark and signal for future enforcement, raising concerns among some firms doing business in the EU. Under the GDPR, a few options exist to transfer personal data in or out of the EU and ensure that privacy is maintained. 1. An organization may use specific Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) or Model Contracts approved by the EU; 2. An organization may comply with domestic privacy regimes of a country that has obtained a mutual adequacy decision from the EU, which means that the EU has deemed that a country's laws and regulations provide an adequate level of data protection; currently, fewer than 15 jurisdictions are deemed adequate by the EU; or 3. A U.S.-based organization may enroll in the bilateral U.S.-EU Privacy Shield program for transatlantic transfer of personal data. The GDPR legal text seems to envision a fourth way, such as a certification scheme to transfer data, that the EU has yet to elaborate. A certification option(s) could create a less burdensome means of compliance for U.S. and other non-EU organizations to transfer personal data to or from the EU in the future. This could be an opportunity for the United States to work with the EU on creating a common system, perhaps even setting a global standard. Some experts contend that the GDPR may effectively set new global data privacy standards, since many companies and organizations are striving for GDPR compliance to avoid being shut out of the EU market, fined, or otherwise penalized, or in case other countries introduce rules that imitate the GDPR. The EU is actively promoting the GDPR and some countries, such as Argentina, are imitating all or parts of the GDPR in their own privacy regulatory and legislative efforts or as part of broader trade negotiations with the EU. In general, the EU does not include cross-border data flows or privacy in free trade agreements. However, alongside trade negotiations with Japan, the EU and Japan agreed to recognize each other's data protection systems as ""equivalent,"" allowing for the free flow of data between the EU and Japan and serving as a first step in adopting an adequacy decision. Under the agreement, Japan committed to implementing additional measures to address the handling of the personal data of EU persons on top of Japan's own privacy regime. China's trade and internet policies reflect state direction and industrial policy, limiting the free flow of information and individual privacy. For example, the requirement for all internet traffic to pass through a national firewall can impede the cross-border transmission of data. China's 2015 counterterrorism law requires telecommunications operators and internet service providers to provide assistance to the government, which could include sharing individuals' data. Citing national security concerns, China's Internet Sovereignty policies, Cybersecurity Law, and Personal Information Security Specification impose strict requirements on companies, such as storing data domestically; limiting the ability to access, use, or transfer data internationally; and mandating security assessments that provide Chinese authorities access to proprietary information. In 2014, China announced a new social credit system, a centralized big-data-enabled system for monitoring and shaping businesses' and citizens' behavior that serves as a self-enforcing regulatory mechanism. According to the government, China aims to make individuals more ""sincere"" and ""trustworthy,"" while obtaining reliable data on the creditworthiness of businesses and individuals. An individual's score would determine the level of government services and opportunities he or she could receive. China seeks to have all its citizens subject to the social credit system by 2020, forcing some U.S. businesses who do business in China, such as airlines, to participate. As of 2018, multiple government agencies and financial institutions contribute data to the platform. Pilot projects are underway in some provinces to apply various rewards and punishments in response to data collected. The lack of control an individual may have and the exposure of what some consider private data is controversial among observers in and out of China. Some countries, such as Vietnam, are following China's approach in creating cybersecurity policies that limit data flows and require local data storage and possible access by government authorities. Some U.S. firms and other multinational companies are considering exiting the Vietnamese market rather than complying, while some analysts suggest that Vietnam's law may not be in compliance with its recent commitments in trade agreements (see below). India has also cited security as the rationale for its draft Personal Data Protection Bill, which would establish broad data localization requirements and limit cross-border transfer of some data. Unlike the EU, these countries do not specify mechanisms to allow for cross-border data flows. U.S. officials have raised concerns with both Vietnam's and India's localization requirements. The EU's emphasis on privacy protection and China's focus on national security (and the countries that emulate their policies) have led these countries to create data-focused policies that restrict international trade and commerce. The United States has traditionally sought a balanced approach between trade, privacy, and security. U.S. data flow policy priorities are articulated in USTR's Digital 2 Dozen report, first developed under the Obama Administration, and the White House's 2017 National Security Strategy. Both Administrations emphasize the need for protection of privacy, the free flow of data across borders, and an interoperable internet. These documents establish the U.S. position that the free flow of data is not inconsistent with privacy protection. Recent free trade agreements translate the U.S. position into binding international commitments. The United States has taken a data-specific approach to regulating data privacy, with laws protecting specific information, such as healthcare or financial data. The FTC enforces consumer protection laws and requires that consumers be notified of and consent to how their data will be used, but the FTC does not have the mandate or resources to enforce broad online privacy protections. There is growing interest among some Members of Congress and in the Administration for a more holistic U.S. data privacy policy. The United States has played an important role in international discussions on privacy and data flows, such as in the OECD, G-20, and APEC, and has included provisions on these subjects in recent free trade agreements. Congress noted the importance of digital trade and the internet as a trading platform in setting the current U.S. trade negotiating objectives in the June 2015 Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation ( P.L. 114-26 ). TPA includes a specific principal U.S. trade negotiating objective on ""digital trade in goods and services and cross-border data flows."" According to TPA, a trade agreement should ensure that governments ""refrain from implementing trade-related measures that impede digital trade in goods and services, restrict cross-border data flows, or require local storage or processing of data."" However, TPA also recognizes that sometimes measures are necessary to achieve legitimate policy objectives and aims for such regulations to be the least trade restrictive, nondiscriminatory, and transparent. Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans‐Pacific Partnership (CPTPP /TPP-11 ) . The CPTPP is a recently concluded trade agreement among 11 Asia-Pacific countries. The CPTPP is based on the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement negotiated by the Obama Administration and from which President Trump withdrew the United States in January 2017. The electronic commerce chapter in TPP, left unchanged in CPTPP, contains the strongest binding trade agreement commitments on digital trade in force globally. CPTPP includes provisions on cross-border data flows and personal information protection. The text specifically states that the parties ""shall allow the cross-border transfer of information."" The agreement allows restrictive measures for legitimate public policy purposes if they are not discriminatory or disguised trade barriers. The agreement also prohibits localization requirements for computing facilities, with similar exceptions. On privacy, the CPTPP requires parties to have a legal framework in place to protect personal information and to have consumer protection laws that cover online commerce. It encourages interoperability between data privacy regimes and encourages cooperation between consumer protection authorities. United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). The released text for the proposed USMCA aims to revise and update the trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and illustrates the Trump Administration's approach. The USMCA chapter 19 on digital trade includes articles on consumer protection, personal information protection, cross-border transfer of information by electronic means, and cybersecurity, among other topics. Building on the TPP, the agreement seeks to balance the legitimate objectives by requiring parties to have a legal framework to protect personal information, have consumer protection laws for online commercial activities, and not prohibit or restrict cross-border transfer of information. While the agreement does not prescribe specific rules or measures that a party must take to protect privacy, it goes further than the TPP (or CPTPP) provisions and provides guidance to inform a country's privacy regime. In particular, the USMCA explicitly refers to the APEC Privacy Framework and OECD Guidelines as relevant and identifies key principles. In general, the proposed USMCA requires that parties not restrict cross-border data flows. Governments are allowed to do so to achieve a legitimate public policy objective (e.g., privacy, national security), provided the measure is not arbitrary, discriminatory, a disguised trade barrier, or greater than necessary to achieve the particular objective. In this way, the parties seek to balance the free flow of data for commerce and communication with protecting privacy and security. The agreement specifically states that the parties may take different legal approaches to protect personal data and also recognizes APEC CBPR as a ""valid mechanism to facilitate cross-border information transfer while protecting personal information."" The agreement aims to increase cooperation between the United States, Mexico, and Canada on a number of digital trade issues, including exchanging information on personal information protection and enforcement experiences; strengthening collaboration on cybersecurity issues; and promoting the APEC CBPR and global interoperability of national privacy regimes. The governments also commit to encourage private-sector self-regulation models and promote cooperation to enforce privacy laws. While the agreement is only between three parties, the provisions are written broadly to encompass global efforts. Some stakeholders look at USMCA as the basis for potential future trade agreements (such as with the UK). Cross-border data flows will likely be a key issue in future U.S.-EU trade negotiations. The United States has articulated a clear position on data privacy in trade agreements; however, there is no single U.S. data privacy policy. Nevertheless, the Trump Administration is seeking to define an overarching U.S. policy on data privacy. The Trump Administration's ongoing three-track process is being managed by the Department of Commerce (Commerce) in consultation with the White House. Different bureaus in Commerce are tasked with different aspects of the process, as follows. 1. The National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing a privacy framework. Similar to its cybersecurity framework, NIST aims to create a voluntary framework as a tool for organizations to adopt to identify, assess, manage, and communicate about privacy risks. By classifying specific privacy outcomes and potential approaches, the framework is intended to enable organizations to create and adapt privacy strategies, innovate, and manage privacy risks within diverse environments. As part of its transparent approach, NIST is currently consulting with public- and private-sector stakeholders through various forms of outreach to collect feedback and aims to have a draft framework before the end of 2019. 2. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is developing a set of privacy principles to guide a domestic legal and policy approach. The NITA sought public comment on a proposed set of ""user-centric privacy outcomes"" and a set of high-level goals. 3. The International Trade Administration (ITA) engages with foreign governments and international organizations such as APEC. ITA is focusing on the international interoperability aspects of potential U.S. privacy policy. ITA's role is to ensure that the NIST and NTIA approaches are consistent with U.S. international policy objectives, including TPA, and principles, such as the OECD framework and APEC CBPRs. Like the EU and China, Commerce is seeking input through a public- and private-sector consultation process. However, unlike the EU or China, Commerce is expecting to create a voluntary privacy framework. Some observers question whether the Commerce approach is sufficient to result in strong privacy protections if it is not backed up by congressional action and federal legislation. Some suggest that Congress could lead a whole-of-government approach through new federal legislation. In the 115 th Congress, then-House Committee on Energy and Commerce Ranking Member Frank Pallone, Jr. requested that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) examine issues related to federal oversight of internet privacy. The January 2019 GAO report concluded that now is ""an appropriate time for Congress to consider comprehensive Internet privacy."" GAO stated that ""Congress should consider developing comprehensive legislation on Internet privacy that would enhance consumer protections and provide flexibility to address a rapidly evolving Internet environment. Issues that should be considered include what authorities agencies should have in order to oversee Internet privacy, including appropriate rulemaking authority."" Recognizing the importance of protecting open data flows amid growing concerns about online privacy, some stakeholders seek to influence U.S. policies on these issues. In addition to submitting comments in response to NTIA and NIST requests and participating in their forums, multiple organizations issued their own sets of principles or guidelines, some referencing the EU GDPR. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has also published model privacy legislation for Congress to consider. Though they vary in emphasis, these proposals share common themes: transparency on what data is being collected and how it is being used; user control, including the ability to opt out of sharing at least some information and to access and correct personal data collected; data security measures, like data breach notification requirements; and enforcement by the FTC; FTC commissioners also voiced support for the agency as the appropriate federal enforcer for consumer privacy. But these groups also differ in some areas, such as whether, or to what extent, to include certain aspects included in the GDPR, such as the right to deletion (so-called ""right to be forgotten""), requirements for data minimization, or extraterritorial reach. There is not consensus on whether the FTC should be given rule-making authority or additional resources, the enforcement role of states, or if an independent data protection commission is needed similar to EU DPAs. Consistent with U.S. trade policy, industry groups generally point out the need to be flexible, encourage private-sector innovation, establish sector- and technology-neutral rules, create international interoperability between privacy regimes, and facilitate cross-border data flows. Private-sector stakeholders generally want to avoid what they regard as overregulation or high compliance burdens. These groups emphasize risk management and a harm-based approach, which they state keeps an organization's costs proportional to the consumer harm prevented. On the other hand, some consumer advocates point to a need for baseline obligations to protect against discrimination, disinformation, or other harm. In general, consumer advocates believe that any comprehensive federal privacy policy should complement, and not supplant, sector-specific privacy legislation or state-level legislation. Finding a global consensus on how to balance open data flows and privacy protection may be key to maintaining trust in the digital environment and advancing international trade. One study found that over 120 countries have laws related to personal data protection. Divergent national privacy approaches raise the costs of doing business and make it harder for governments to collaborate and share data, whether for scientific research, defense, or law enforcement. A system for global interoperability in a least trade-restrictive and nondiscriminatory way between different national systems could help minimize costs and allow entities in different jurisdictions with varying online privacy regimes to share data via cross-border data flows. Such a system could help avoid fragmentation of the internet between European, Chinese, and American spheres, a danger that some analysts have warned against. For example, Figure 2 suggests the potential of an interoperability system that allows data to flow freely between GDPR- and CBPR-certified economies. The OECD guidelines, G-20 principles, APEC CBPR, CPTPP, and USMCA provisions demonstrate an evolving understanding on how to balance cross-border data flows, security, and privacy, to create interoperable policies that can be tailored by countries and avoid fragmentation or the potential exclusion of other countries or regulatory systems. The various trade agreements and initiatives with differing sets of parties may ultimately pave the way for a broader multilateral understanding and eventually lead to more enforceable binding commitments founded on the key WTO principles of nondiscrimination, least trade restrictiveness, and transparency. Congress may consider the trade-related aspects of data flows in trade agreements, including through close examination of these provisions during the congressional debate and consideration of legislation to implement the proposed USMCA. Issues include whether the agreements make progress in meeting TPA's related trade negotiating objectives and if the provisions strike the appropriate balance among public policy objectives. In addition, USTR's specific trade negotiating objectives for future agreements with the EU and Japan include establishing rules to protect cross-border data flows. These future trade negotiations present challenges and provide opportunities for Congress to further engage USTR on the issues and to conduct oversight. Congress may further consider how best to achieve broader consensus on data flows and privacy at the global level. Congress could, for example, conduct additional oversight of current best practice approaches (e.g., OECD, APEC) or ongoing negotiations in the WTO on e-commerce to create rules through plurilateral or multilateral agreements. Congress may consider endorsing certain of these efforts to influence international discussions and the engagement of other countries. Congress may want to examine the potential challenges and implications of building a system of interoperability between APEC, CBPR, and the EU GDPR. Related issues are the extent to which the EU is establishing its system as a potential de facto global approach through its trade agreements and other mechanisms, and how U.S. and other trade agreements may ultimately provide approaches that could be adopted more globally. Congress may seek to better understand the economic impact of data flows and privacy regimes in other countries related to U.S. access to other markets and the extent to which barriers are being put in place that may discriminate against U.S. exporters. Congress may examine the lack of reciprocal treatment and limits on U.S. firms' access to some foreign markets. Congress may consider the implications of not having a comprehensive national data privacy policy. Will the EU GDPR and China cybersecurity policies become the global norms that other countries follow in the absence of a clear U.S. alternative? Congress may enact comprehensive privacy legislation. In considering such action, Congress could investigate and conduct oversight of the Administration's ongoing privacy efforts, including requesting briefings and updates on the NTIA, NIST, and ITA initiatives to provide congressional feedback and direction and ensure they are aligned with U.S. trade objectives. Congress may also seek input from other federal agencies. In deliberating a comprehensive U.S. policy on personal data privacy, Congress may review the GAO report's findings and conclusions. Congress may also weigh several factors, including: How can U.S. trade and domestic policy achieve the appropriate balance to encourage cross-border commerce, economic growth, and innovation, while safeguarding individual privacy and national security? How would a new privacy regime affect U.S. consumers and businesses, including large multinationals who must comply with different national privacy regimes and small- and medium-sized enterprises with limited resources and technology expertise? Do U.S. agencies have the needed tools to accurately assess the size and scope of cross-border data flows to help analyze the economic impact of different privacy policies, or measure the costs of trade barriers? How should an evolving U.S. privacy regime align with U.S. trade policy objectives and evolving international standards, such as the OECD Guidelines for privacy and cybersecurity, and should U.S. policymakers prioritize interoperability with other international privacy frameworks to avoid further fragmentation of global markets and so-called balkanization of the internet? In addition, there are a host of other policy considerations not directly related to trade.\n\n","['""Cross-border data flows"" refers to the movement or transfer of information between computer servers across national borders. Such data flows enable people to transmit information for online communication, track global supply chains, share research, provide cross-border services, and support technological innovation. Ensuring open cross-border data flows has been an objective of Congress in recent trade agreements and in broader U.S. international trade policy. The free flow of personal data, however, has raised security and privacy concerns. U.S. trade policy has traditionally sought to balance the need for cross-border data flows, which often include personal data, with online privacy and security. Some stakeholders, including some Members of Congress, believe that U.S. policy should better protect personal data privacy and security, and have introduced legislation to set a national policy. Other policymakers and analysts are concerned about increasing foreign barriers to U.S. digital trade, including data flows. Recent incidents of private information being shared or exposed have heightened public awareness of the risks posed to personal data stored online. Consumers\' personal online data is valued by organizations for a variety of reasons, such as analyzing marketing information and easing the efficiency of transactions. Concerns are likely to grow as the amount of online data organizations collect and the level of global data flows expand. As Congress assesses policy options, it may further explore the link between cross-border data flows, online privacy, and trade policy; the trade implications of a comprehensive data privacy policy; and the U.S. role in establishing best practices and binding trade rules that seek to balance public policy priorities. There is no globally accepted standard or definition of data privacy in the online world, and there are no comprehensive binding multilateral rules specifically about cross-border data flows and privacy. Several international organizations, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), G-20, and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, have sought to develop best practice guidelines or principles related to privacy and cross-border data flows, although none are legally binding. U.S. and other recent trade agreements are establishing new enforceable trade rules and disciplines. Countries vary in their data policies and laws; some focus on limiting access to online information by restricting the flow of data beyond a country\'s borders, aiming to protect domestic interests (e.g., constituents\' privacy). However, these policies can also act as protectionist measures. The EU and China, two top U.S. trading partners, have established prescriptive rules on cross-border data flows and personal data from different perspectives. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is driven by privacy concerns; China is focused on security. Their policies affect U.S. firms seeking to do business in those regions, as well as in other markets that emulate the EU and Chinese approaches. Unlike the EU or China, the United States does not broadly restrict cross-border data flows and has traditionally regulated privacy at a sectoral level to cover data, such as health records. U.S. trade policy has sought to balance the goals of consumer privacy, security, and open commerce. The proposed United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) represents the Trump Administration\'s first attempt to include negotiated trade rules and disciplines on privacy, cross-border data flows, and security in a trade agreement. While the United States and other countries work to define their respective national privacy strategies, many stakeholders seek a more global approach that would allow interoperability between differing national regimes to facilitate and remove discriminatory trade barriers to cross-border data flows; this could offer an opportunity for the United States to lead the global conversation. Although Congress has examined issues surrounding online privacy and has considered multiple bills, there is not yet consensus on a comprehensive U.S. online data privacy policy. Congress may weigh in as the Administration seeks to define U.S. policy on data privacy and engages in international negotiations on cross-border data flows.']","7088","gov_report","en","None","1b6b47fa851187e2eb91a700bfab672580beef5a1671dd5c","Summary:","gov_report","532","\n\nThe report provides an in-depth analysis of cross-border data flows and privacy in the context of international trade and polic"
"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nThe federal government supports the development of airport infrastructure in three different ways. First, the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) provides federal grants to airports for planning and development, mainly of capital projects related to aircraft operations such as runways and taxiways. Second, Congress has authorized airports to assess a local passenger facility charge (PFC) on each boarding passenger, subject to specific federal approval. PFC revenues can be used for a broader range of projects than AIP funds, including ""landside"" projects such as passenger terminals and ground access improvements. Third, federal law grants investors preferential income tax treatment on interest income from bonds issued by state and local governments for airport improvements (subject to compliance with federal rules). Airports may also draw on state and local funds and on operating revenues, such as lease payments and landing fees. A federal role in airport infrastructure first developed during World War II. Prior to the war, airports were a local or private responsibility, with federal support limited to the tax exclusion of municipal bond interest. National defense needs led to the first major federal support for airport construction. After the war, the Federal Airport Act of 1946 (P.L. 79-377) continued federal a id, although at lower levels than during the war years. Initially, much of this spending supported conversion of military airports to civilian use. In the 1960s, substantial funding also was used to upgrade and extend runways for use by commercial jets. In 1970, Congress responded to increasing congestion, both in the air and on the ground at U.S. airports, by passing two laws. The first, the Airport and Airway Development Act, established the forerunner programs of AIP: the Airport Development Aid Program and the Planning Grant Program. The second, the Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970, dealt with the revenue side of airport development, establishing the Airport and Airway Trust Fund (AATF, also referred to as the Aviation Trust Fund, and in this report, the trust fund). The Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 ( P.L. 97-248 ; the 1982 Act) created the current AIP and reactivated the trust fund. For a more detailed legislative history of AIP, see Appendix A of this report. Eight years later, amid concerns that the existing sources of funds for airport development would be insufficient to meet national airport needs, the Aviation Safety and Capacity Expansion Act of 1990 (Title IX of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, P.L. 101-508 ) allowed the Secretary of Transportation to authorize public agencies that control commercial airports to impose a passenger facility charge on each paying passenger boarding an aircraft at their airports. Different airports use different combinations of AIP funding, PFCs, tax-exempt bonds, state and local grants, and airport revenues to finance particular projects. Small airports are more likely to be dependent on AIP grants than large or medium-sized airports. Larger airports are much more likely to issue tax-exempt bonds or finance capital projects with the proceeds of PFCs. Each of these funding sources places various legislative, regulatory, or contractual constraints on airports that use it. The availability and conditions of one source of funding may also influence the availability and terms of other funding sources. In a 2015 study, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that airport-generated net income financed about 38% of airports' capital spending, AIP 33%, PFCs 18%, capital contributions by airport sponsor (often a state or municipality) or by other sources such as an airline or tenant 6%, and state grants nearly 5%. AIP provides federal grants to airports for airport development and planning. Participants range from very large publicly owned commercial airports to small general aviation airports that may be privately owned but are available for public use. AIP funding is usually limited to construction of improvements related to aircraft operations, such as runways and taxiways. Commercial revenue-producing facilities are generally not eligible for AIP funding, nor are operating costs. The structure of AIP funds distribution reflects congressional priorities and the objectives of assuring airport safety and security, increasing airport capacity, reducing congestion, helping fund noise and environmental mitigation costs, and financing small state and community airports. The main financial advantage of AIP to airports is that, as a grant program, it can provide funds for capital projects without the financial burden of debt financing, although airports are required to provide a modest local match to the federal funds. Limitations on the use of AIP grants include the range of projects that AIP can fund and the requirement that recipients adhere to all program regulations and grant assurances. Federal law requires the Secretary of Transportation to publish a national plan for the development of public-use airports in the United States. This appears as a biannual Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) publication called the National Plan of Integrated Airport System s (NPIAS) . For an airport to receive AIP funds, it must be listed in the NPIAS. AIP program structure and authorizations are set in FAA authorization acts. Modifications have been made to AIP through the years, but the basic program structure remains the same. The most recent act, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 ( P.L. 115-254 ), authorized AIP funding through FY2023. The trust fund was designed to assure an adequate and consistent source of funds for federal airport and airway programs. It is the primary funding source for most FAA activities in addition to federal grants to airports. These include facilities and equipment (F&E); research, engineering, and development (R, E&D); and FAA operations and maintenance (O&M). Congress determines how much the trust fund will be allowed to expend for various purposes, including the AIP. The money flowing into the Airport and Airway Trust Fund comes from a variety of aviation-related taxes. These taxes were authorized by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 ( P.L. 105-34 ) and reauthorized by the 2018 FAA reauthorization act. Revenue sources include the following: 7.5% ticket tax, $4.20 flight segment tax, 6.25% tax on cargo waybills, 4.4 cents per gallon on commercial aviation fuel, 19.4 cents per gallon on general aviation gasoline, 21.9 cents per gallon on general aviation jet fuel, 14.1 cents per gallon fractional ownership surtax on general aviation jet fuel, $18.60 international arrival tax, $18.60 international departure tax, and 7.5% ""frequent flyer"" award tax. In most years since the trust fund was established, the revenues plus interest on the unexpended balances brought in more money than was being paid out. This led to the growth in the end-of-year unexpended balances in the trust fund. At times these unexpended balances are inaccurately referred to as a surplus. In practice, FAA may have committed unexpended balances to fund particular airport projects, so those balances may not be available for other purposes. Most air carriers have altered their pricing structures in ways that have implications for the trust fund. Ancillary fees are now commonly charged for services such as checked baggage that in the past were included in the ticket price. Such fees are not subject to the 7.5% ticket tax. Had the $4.57 billion in baggage fees collected in 2017 been subject to the ticket tax, the trust fund might have received more than $343 million in additional revenue. AIP spending authorized and the amounts actually made available for grants from the aviation trust fund since FY2000 are illustrated in Table 1 . After trending upward from FY1982 to FY1992, grant funding approved in annual appropriations declined through the mid-1990s as part of federal deficit reduction efforts, leaving large gaps between authorized AIP spending levels and the amounts the program was actually allowed to expend. This occurred despite provisions in place since 1976 designed to ensure that federal capital spending for airports is fully funded at the authorized level (see Text B ox ). The Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21 st Century (AIR21; P.L. 106-181 ), enacted in 2000, provided major increases in AIP's authorization, starting in FY2001. During FY2001-FY2006 AIP was funded near its fully authorized levels. The amount available for grants peaked at $3.47 billion in FY2008. From FY2008 through FY2011, when AIP was authorized by a series of authorization extension acts, appropriators set the program's annual obligation limitation at $3.515 billion. The 2012 FAA Modernization and Reform Act authorized funding through FY2015 at an annual level of $3.35 billion. In July 2016, the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 ( P.L. 114-190 ) was passed to further extend the authorization of AIP at the annual level of $3.35 billion through September 30, 2017. The 115 th Congress passed a six-month extension ( P.L. 115-63 ) of aviation funding and programs through the end of March 2018. Subsequently, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 ( P.L. 115-141 ), provided a further extension through the end of FY2018. In addition to the annual funding of $3.35 billion, the 2018 appropriations act provided a $1.0 billion appropriation from the general fund to the AIP discretionary grants program. The Secretary of Transportation was directed to keep this supplemental funding available through September 30, 2020, and to give priority to nonprimary, nonhub, and small hub airports. These supplemental funds are not included in the AIP funding summary or discussion in this report, as FAA is in the process of evaluating applications and distributing funds. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 ( P.L. 115-254 ) funded AIP from FY2019 through FY2023 at an annual level of $3.35 billion. It also authorized supplemental annual funding from the general fund to the AIP discretionary grants program ($1.02 billion in FY2019, $1.04 billion in FY2020, $1.06 billion in FY2021, $1.09 billion in FY2022, and $1.11 billion in FY2023), and required at least 50% of these additional funds to be available to nonhub and small hub airports. In February 2019, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ). The act provided a $500 million supplemental appropriation from the general fund to the AIP discretionary grants program and required that this money remain available through September 30, 2021. The distribution system for AIP grants is complex. It is based on a combination of formula grants (also referred to as apportionments or entitlements) and discretionary funds. Each year the entitlements are first apportioned by formula to specific airports or types of airports. Once the entitlements are satisfied, the remaining funds are defined as discretionary funds. Airports apply for discretionary funds for projects in their airport master plans. Formula grants and discretionary funds are not mutually exclusive, in the sense that airports receiving formula funds may also apply for and receive discretionary funds. Grants are generally awarded directly to airports. Legislation sets forth definitions of airports that are relevant both in discussions of the airport system in general and of AIP funding distribution in particular (see Appendix B ). The statutory provisions for the allocation of both formula and discretionary funds are based on these definitions. Entitlements are funds that are apportioned by formula to airports and may generally be used for any eligible airport improvement or planning project. These funds are divided into four categories: primary airports, cargo service airports, general aviation airports, and Alaska supplemental funds (see Appendix B for a full list of airport definitions). Each category distributes AIP funds by a different formula (49 U.S.C. §47114). Most airports have up to three years to use their apportionments. Nonhub commercial service airports have up to four years. The formula distributions are contingent on an annual AIP obligation limitation of $3.2 billion or more. If this threshold is not met in a particular fiscal year, most formulas revert to prior authorized funding formulas. Primary Airports. The apportionment for airports that board more than 10,000 passengers each year is based on the number of boardings (also referred to as enplanements) during the prior calendar year. The amount apportioned for each fiscal year is equal to double the amount that would be received according to the following formulas: $7.80 for each of the first 50,000 passenger boardings; $5.20 for each of the next 50,000 passenger boardings; $2.60 for each of the next 400,000 passenger boardings; $0.65 for each of the next 500,000 passenger boardings; and $0.50 for each passenger boarding in excess of 1 million. The minimum allocation to any primary airport is $1 million. The maximum is $26 million. Cargo Service Airports. Some 3.5% of AIP funds subject to apportionment are apportioned to airports served by all-cargo aircraft with a total annual landed weight of more than 100 million pounds. The allocation formula is the proportion of the individual airport's landed weight to the total landed weight at all cargo service airports. General Aviation Airports. General aviation, reliever, and nonprimary commercial service airports are apportioned 20% of AIP funds subject to apportionment. From this share, all airports, excluding all nonreliever primary airports, receive the lesser of the following: $150,000; or one-fifth of the estimated five-year costs for airport development for each of these airports as listed in the most recent NPIAS. Any remaining funds are distributed according to a state-based population and area formula. FAA makes the project decisions on the use of these funds in consultation with the states. Although FAA has ultimate control, some states view these funds as an opportunity to address general aviation needs from a statewide, rather than a local or national, perspective. Alaska Supplemental Funds. Funds are apportioned to airports in Alaska to assure that Alaskan airports receive at least twice as much funding as they did under the Airport Development Aid Program in 1980. Foregone Apportionments. Large and medium hub airports that collect a passenger facility charge of $3 or less have their AIP formula entitlements reduced by an amount equal to 50% of their projected PFC revenue for the fiscal year until they forgo or give back 50% of their AIP formula grants. In the case of PFC above the $3 level the percentage forgone is 75%. A special small airport fund, which provides grants on a discretionary basis to airports smaller than medium hub, gets 87.5% of these foregone funds. The discretionary fund gets the remaining 12.5%. The discretionary funds (49 U.S.C. §§47115-47116) include the money not distributed under the apportioned entitlements, as well as the forgone PFC revenues that were not deposited into the small airport fund. AIP discretionary funding for FY2018 was about 9.4% of the total AIP funding. Discretionary grants are approved by FAA based on project priority and other selection criteria. Figure 1 illustrates the composition of both apportioned and discretionary grants, based on FY2018 data. Despite its name, the discretionary fund is not allocated solely at FAA's discretion. Allocations are subject to the following three set-asides and certain other spending criteria: Airport Noise Set-Asides . At least 35% of discretionary funds are set aside for noise compatibility planning and for carrying out noise abatement and compatibility programs. Military Airport Program . At least 4% of discretionary funds are set aside for conversion and dual use of up to 15 current and former military airports. The program allows funding of some projects not normally eligible under AIP. Grants for Reliever Airports . There is a set-aside of two-thirds of 1% of discretionary funds for reliever airports in metropolitan areas suffering from flight delays. The Secretary of Transportation is also directed to see that 75% of the grants made from the discretionary fund are used to preserve and enhance capacity, safety, and security at primary and reliever airports, and also to carry out airport noise compatibility planning and programs at these airports. From the remaining 25%, FAA is required to set aside $5 million for the testing and evaluation of innovative aviation security systems. Subject to these limitations and the three set-asides, the Secretary of Transportation, through FAA, has discretion in distribution of grants from the remainder of the discretionary fund. Under this program, FAA provides funds directly to participating states for projects at airports classified as other than primary airports. Each participating state receives a block grant made up of the state's apportionment (formula) funds and available discretionary funds. A block grant program state is responsible for selecting and funding AIP projects at the small airports in the state. In making the selections, the participating states are required to comply with federal priorities. Each block grant state is responsible for project administration as well as most of the inspection and oversight roles normally assumed by FAA. The states that currently participate in the state block grant program are Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin. For AIP projects, the federal government share differs depending on the type of airport. The federal share, whether funded by formula or discretionary grants, is as follows: 75% for large and medium hub airports (80% for noise compatibility projects); 90% for other airports; ""not more than"" 90% for airport projects in states participating in the state block grant program; 70% for projects funded from the discretionary fund at airports receiving exemptions under 49 U.S.C. §47134, the pilot program for private ownership of airports; airports reclassified as medium hubs due to increased passenger volumes may retain eligibility for up to a 90% federal share for a two-year transition period; certain economically distressed communities receiving subsidized air service may be eligible for up to a 95% federal share of project costs. This cost-share structure means that smaller airports pay a lower share of AIP-funded project costs than larger airports. The airports themselves must raise the remaining share from other sources. Although smaller airports' individual grants are of much smaller dollar amounts than the grants going to large and medium hub airports, the smaller airports are much more dependent on AIP to meet their capital needs. This is particularly the case for noncommercial airports, such as general aviation and reliever airports, which received over 25% of AIP grants distributed in FY2018. Air carriers have objected to this allocation, pointing out that their passengers and freight shippers pay the vast majority of revenue flowing into the trust fund. General aviation interests, however, defend AIP grants to noncommercial airports. Figure 2 shows the share of AIP grants awarded in FY2018, by value, broken out by airport type. Figure 3 displays AIP grants awarded by type of project for FY2018. For the most part, AIP development grants support ""airside"" development projects such as runways, taxiways, aprons, navigation aids, lighting, and airside safety projects. Substantial AIP funds also go for state block grants and noise planning and abatement. AIP spending on roads is generally restricted to roads on or entering airport property. In cases in which a primary or reliever airport may want to begin an AIP-eligible project without waiting for the funds to become available, FAA is authorized to issue a letter of intent (LOI). If it does so, the LOI states that eligible project costs, up to the allowable federal share, will be reimbursed according to a schedule set forth in the letter. Although the LOI technically does not obligate the federal government, it is an indication of FAA's approval of the scope and timing of the project, as well as the federal intent to fund the project in future years. Because most primary airports fund their major development projects with tax-exempt revenue bonds, the evidence of federal support that the LOI provides is likely to lead to favorable bond interest rates. The airport may proceed with the project with assurance that all AIP-allowable costs specified in the LOI will remain eligible for reimbursement over the life of the LOI. Both entitlement and discretionary funds are used to fulfill LOIs. FAA limits the total of discretionary funds in all LOIs subject to future obligation to roughly 50% of forecast available discretionary funds. LOIs have certain eligibility restrictions. They can only be issued to cover projects at primary and reliever airports. The proposed airport development project or action must ""enhance airfield capacity in terms of increased aircraft operations, increased aircraft seating or cargo capacity, or reduced airfield operational delays."" For large and medium hub airports, the project must enhance ""system-wide airport capacity significantly."" Airports' grant applications are conditioned on assurances regarding future airport operations. Examples of such assurances include making the airport available for public use on reasonable conditions and without unjust economic discrimination (against all types, kinds, and classes of aeronautical activities); charging air carriers making similar use of the airport substantially comparable amounts; maintaining a current airport layout plan; making financial reports to FAA; and expending airport revenue only on capital or operating costs at the airport. Within the AIP context, assurances are a means of guaranteeing the implementation of federal policy. Obligations derived from airports' assurances extend beyond the formal closure of AIP grant-supported projects. Obligations related to the use, operation, and maintenance of an airport remain in effect for the expected life of the improvement, up to 20 years. In the case of the purchase of land with AIP funds, the federal obligations do not expire. Airports may request that FAA release them from their AIP contractual obligations. Typically, as a condition of the release, the airport sponsor must either reimburse the federal government for the AIP grants (in the case of land grants, the federal share of the fair market value of the land) or reinvest the amount in an approved AIP project (see Text B ox ). When airport managers or interest groups express concerns about the ""strings attached"" to AIP funding, they are usually referring to AIP grant assurances. In 1990, federal deficits and expected tight budgets led to concerns that the Airport and Airway Trust Fund and other existing sources of funds for airport development would be insufficient to meet national airport needs. This led to authorization of a new user charge, the Passenger Facility Charge (PFC). The PFC was seen as a complementary funding source to AIP. The Aviation Safety and Capacity Expansion Act of 1990 allowed the Secretary of Transportation to authorize public agencies that control commercial airports to impose a fee on each paying passenger boarding an aircraft at their airports. Initially, there was a $3 cap on each airport's PFC and a $12 limit on the total PFCs that a passenger could be charged per round trip. The PFC is a state, local, or port authority fee, not a federally imposed tax deposited into the Treasury. Because of the complementary relationship between AIP and PFCs, PFC provisions are generally folded into the sections of FAA reauthorization legislation dealing with AIP. The money raised from PFCs must be used to finance eligible airport-related projects. Unlike AIP funds, PFC funds may be used to service debt incurred to carry out projects. Legislation in 2000 raised the PFC ceiling to $4.50, with an $18 limit on the total PFCs that a passenger can be charged per round trip. To impose a PFC above $3 an airport has to show that the funded projects will make significant improvements in air safety, increase competition, or reduce congestion or noise impacts on communities, and that these projects could not be fully funded by using the airport's AIP formula funds or AIP discretionary grants. Large and medium hub airports imposing PFCs above the $3 level forgo 75% of their AIP formula funds. PFCs at large and medium hub airports may not be approved unless the airport has submitted a written competition plan to FAA, which includes information about the availability of gates, leasing arrangements, gate-use requirements, controls over airside and ground-side capacity, and intentions to build gates that could be used as common facilities. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 included minor changes to the PFC program. The act made permanent the trial program that authorized nonhub small airports to impose PFCs. The act also required GAO to study alternative means of collecting PFCs without including the PFC in the ticket price. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 did not include significant changes to the PFC program and maintained the $4.50 PFC cap, with a maximum charge of $18 per round-trip flight. It did include a provision, however, that required a qualified organization to conduct a study assessing the infrastructure needs of airports and existing financial resources for commercial service airports and to make recommendations on the actions needed to upgrade the national aviation infrastructure system. Unlike AIP grants, of which over 67% in FY2018 went to airside projects (runways, taxiways, aprons, and safety-related projects), PFC revenues are heavily used for landside projects, such as terminals and transit systems on airport property, and for interest payments. Table 2 shows the AIP grant awards and PFC approvals by project type in FY2018. Annual system-wide PFC collections grew from $85.4 million in 1992 to over $3.4 billion in 2018. The PFC statutory language lends itself to a broader interpretation of ""capacity enhancing"" projects, and the implementing regulations are less constraining than those for AIP funds. Air carriers, which historically have preferred funding to be dedicated to airside projects, must be notified and provided with an opportunity for consultation about airports' proposals to fund projects with PFC revenues. They are generally less involved in the PFC project planning and decisionmaking process than is the case with AIP projects. The difference in the pattern of project types may also be influenced by the fact that larger airports, which collect most of the PFC revenue, tend to have substantial landside infrastructure, whereas smaller airports that are much more dependent on AIP funding have comparatively limited landside facilities. Bonds have long been a major source of funding for capital projects at primary airports. According to Bond Buyer, a trade publication, airports raised approximately $17.4 billion in 84 bond issues in 2018, a substantial increase over the $14.7 billion raised in 116 issues in 2017. Most airport-related bonds are classified as tax-exempt private activity bonds (PABs). These bonds, issued by a local government or public authority, allow the use of landing fees, charges on airport users, and property taxes on privately controlled on-airport buildings, such as cargo facilities, to service debt without obligating tax revenue. Their tax-exempt status enables airports to raise funds more cheaply than would otherwise be the case because investors enjoy a federal income tax exclusion on interest paid on the bonds. In some cases, revenue from PFCs may be used to service the bonds. PABs may be used to build facilities that are directly related and essential to servicing aircraft, enabling aircraft to take off and land, and transferring passengers or cargo to or from aircraft. Normally, airport bonds might be classified as taxable PABs because they are used to finance facilities where more than 90% of the activity is private and more than 90% of the repayment is from revenue generated by the facility. Issuers of taxable PABs must pay higher interest rates than required on tax-exempt bonds, to compensate investors for the taxes due on interest income. Congress therefore created an exception allowing airports that are owned by governmental entities to issue ""qualified"" PABs that are tax-exempt.  The majority of airport bonds are considered by the Internal Revenue Service to be ""qualified"" PABs. Some recent proposals would allow privately owned airports to receive the same tax-preferred treatment of their bonds as airports owned by public authorities. A possible precedent for this is the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users ( P.L. 109-59 , §1143; SAFETEA-LU), which allowed for up to $15 billion in tax-exempt bond financing for highways or freight transfer facilities that would otherwise not qualify for tax-exempt financing. Many of the supporters of the SAFETEA-LU provisions envisioned expanded eligibility for PABs as a means of facilitating public-private partnerships between a public authority and an outside investor. In the airport context, this would be analogous to an airport authority agreeing to a long-term lease with a private investor who would have the ability to enter the market for tax-exempt bonds to finance improvements at the airport and, perhaps, also to finance the purchasing costs of the lease itself. By statute, the safe operation of airports is the highest aviation priority. Other priorities established by Congress include increasing capacity to the maximum feasible extent, minimizing noise impacts, and encouraging efficient service to state and local communities (i.e., support for general aviation airports). But there are significant disagreements about the appropriate degree of federal participation in airport development and finance and about the specific types of expenditure that should be given priority within AIP. Airline and airport operators tend to view the fully authorized funding of the program as a good thing. An alternative view, however, is that too much has been spent on AIP, particularly at smaller airports that do not play a significant role in commercial aviation. The assessment of airport capital needs is fundamental to determining the appropriate federal support needed to foster a safe and efficient national airport system. The federal government's interest goes beyond capacity issues to include implementation of federal safety and noise policies. Both FAA and the Airports Council International-North America (ACI-NA) have issued projections of airports' long-term financial needs. In its most recent NPIAS report, FAA estimated that the national system's capital needs for FY2019-FY2023 will total $35.1 billion (an annual average of approximately $7 billion). The ACI-NA infrastructure needs survey resulted in an estimate of $128.1 billion over the same years (an annual average of approximately $25.6 billion). The main reason for the widely differing estimates was disparate views on what kinds of airport projects to include. The NPIAS report was based on information taken from airport master plans and state system plans, but FAA planners screened out planned projects not justified by aviation activity forecasts or not eligible for AIP grants. Only designated NPIAS airports were included in the FAA study. Implicit in this methodology is that the planning has been carried through to the point where financing is identified. Not all projects used to develop the NPIAS estimates are actually completed, or in some cases even begun, within the range of years covered in the NPIAS estimates. ACI-NA argues that the NPIAS underestimates AIP eligible needs because not all such needs will be in the current airport plans. The ACI-NA study reflects the broader business view of major airport operators and casts a substantially wider net. It includes projects funded by PFCs, bonds, or state or local funding; airport-funded air traffic control facilities; airport- or TSA-funded security projects; ""necessary"" AIP-ineligible projects such as parking facilities, hangars, revenue portions of terminals, and off-airport roads/transit facilities; and AIP-eligible projects not reported to FAA in the belief that there would be a low probability of receiving additional AIP funding. Its 2019-2023 infrastructure needs survey, for example, included major airport terminal projects that are ineligible for AIP grants. The ACI-NA study also includes projects without identified funding sources. The ACI-NA estimate is higher than the FAA estimate because of the wider net it casts and because it is adjusted for projected inflation. The estimates are important because the primary AIP reauthorization issue is the program's appropriate level of funding. Because the ACI-NA airport needs projection includes much that is not eligible for AIP grants, its accuracy may not be as critical in evaluating appropriate AIP funding levels as that of the NPIAS projections. On the other hand, the broader ACI-NA estimate may be more significant for policy choices related to bond issuance and PFCs, since these sources fund a broader range of projects than AIP. In 2004, then-FAA Administrator Marion C. Blakey stated that the agency's goal was to increase total capacity at the top 35 U.S. airports by 30% over a 10-year period. FAA's Operational Evolution Plan (OEP) is intended to increase the capacity and efficiency of the National Airspace System (NAS) over a 10-year period to keep up with the expected growth in demand for air travel and air cargo. In support of that goal, FAA released a study focused on the 35 busiest airports, Capacity Needs in the National Airspace System: An Analysis of Airport and Metropolitan Area Demand and Operational Capacity in the Future (also referred to as FACT1). The study projected 18 airports would need additional capacity by 2020. In 2007, FACT1 was updated by a second study, FACT2. FACT2 expanded the study to include 21 non-OEP airports that were identified as having the potential to be capacity constrained or were in capacity-constrained metropolitan areas. The study examined airports that would need capacity increases and also projected which airports would need capacity increases in 2015 and 2025. It identified four airports plus the New York metropolitan area that needed additional capacity in 2007. It further identified 14 hub airports as likely to be capacity-constrained in 2025. FACT2 found that, in comparison to FACT1, many non-OEP airports ""... have higher capacities than originally presumed and thus less need for additional capacity."" A further update, FACT3, was released in January 2015. FACT3 forecasted that the 2007-2009 recession, volatile fuel costs, airline consolidation, and replacement of many 50-seat regional jets with larger aircraft would result in 32% fewer operations and about 23% fewer enplanements in 2025 at the 30 core airports than forecast in FACT2. It projected that airport delays would remain concentrated at a few major hub airports, notably the three New York City-area airports, Philadelphia International Airport, and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. This study may have implications for the reauthorization of AIP. The large runway projects that are the focus of the OEP can require long lead times—10 or more years from concept to initial construction is not unusual. At large and medium hub airports, runway projects are usually paid for, in part, by AIP funds. Therefore, some projects needed by 2025 may require AIP funding in earlier years. Because large and medium airports that levy PFCs must forgo either 50% or 75% of their AIP formula entitlement funds, most federal funding for their runway projects would probably need to take the form of AIP discretionary funds. The pool of discretionary funds is primarily the remainder of annual funding after the entitlement formula requirements are satisfied. Of the forgone PFC funds, 87.5% are reserved for the small airport fund and are also not available for OEP airports. If the AIP budget is constrained in the future, either under a reauthorization bill or during the annual appropriations process, and the entitlement formulas remain as they are, the discretionary portion of the AIP budget may be squeezed, limiting large airports' ability to draw on AIP funds for major capacity expansion projects. Many of the attributes of AIP's programmatic structure are similar to those of the 1982 act that created the program. Over the years these attributes have been modified based on perceived needs and on the practical politics of passing the periodic FAA reauthorization bills that contain the AIP provisions. These considerations make a major overhaul of the AIP structure unlikely, but may leave room for programmatic adjustments in the distribution of apportionments. One such adjustment might shift AIP funds to enhancing capacity at large and medium hub airports. There are several ways Congress might accomplish this. One would be to eliminate the requirement that large and medium hub airports that impose the maximum PFCs forgo 75% of their entitlements. This change would give larger airports a greater share of entitlement funding, but at the cost of reducing AIP grants to small airports. Alternatively, changes in the statutory set-asides of discretionary funds could give FAA more flexibility to use that money for capacity enhancement, but might reduce funding for noise mitigation and other purposes. Changes in the last several FAA authorization acts increased entitlements and broadened the range of landside projects eligible for AIP grants. These changes generally benefitted airports smaller than medium hub size. In particular, the increased amount of apportioned funds has limited the availability of funds for discretionary grants at major airports. Further changes giving airports increased flexibility in the use of their entitlements might benefit smaller airports not served by commercial aviation, in line with the national goal of having an ""extensive"" national airport system, but this use of funds might conflict with the goal of reducing congestion at major commercial airports. The current apportionment system relies on a $3.2 billion funding level trigger mechanism to lift most of the apportionments to twice their formula level. This has been in place for two reauthorization cycles. Should that trigger be breached, entitlements for all airports would be reduced drastically. The entitlement formulas may not be sustainable, without depleting discretionary funds, in the absence of additional funding for AIP. One way to reduce the amount of trust fund revenue needed for AIP would be to allow large and medium hub airports to opt out of AIP and rely exclusively on PFCs to finance capital projects. This would require raising or eliminating the federal cap on PFCs. These ""defederalized"" airports could then be released from some or all of the AIP grant assurances under which they now operate, such as land use requirements and airport revenue use restrictions. If airports exit the program, AIP spending could be reduced or could be redirected to other NPIAS airports. Airport privatization denotes a change in ownership from a public entity (such as a local government or an airport authority established by a state government) to a private one. In a number of countries, such as Great Britain, government-owned airports have been privatized by sale to private owners. In the United States, some airports have allowed private ownership of certain on-airport facilities or management functions, but the ownership of all major airports remains in the hands of government entities. The Airport Privatization Pilot Program (49 U.S.C. §47134; Section 149 of the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996, P.L. 104-264 , as amended) authorizes FAA to exempt up to 10 airports from certain federal restrictions on the use of airport revenue off-airport. Participating airports may be also exempted from certain requirements on the repayment of federal grants. Privatized airports may still participate in the AIP, but at a lower federal share (70%). The pilot program was renamed the Airport Investment Partnership Program (AIPP) in the 2018 FAA reauthorization act and expanded to admit more than 10 airports. The AIPP provides that at primary airports, the airport sponsor may only recover from the sale or lease an amount approved by at least 65% of the scheduled air carriers serving the airport, as well as by both scheduled and unscheduled air carriers that together account for 65% of the total landed weight at the airport for the year. The requirement that air carriers approve the use of airport revenue for nonairport purposes, such as profit distribution, may have served to limit interest in the program. To date, only two airports have completed the privatization process established under the provisions of the AIPP. One of those, Stewart International Airport in New York State, subsequently reverted to public ownership when it was purchased by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan, PR, is now the only commercial service airport operating under private management after privatization under the APPP. As of 2018, there are three applicants under active FAA consideration: Hendry County Airglades Airport in Clewiston, FL; Westchester Airport in White Plains, NY; and St. Louis Lambert International Airport in St. Louis, MO. There is no certainty that any AIP cost savings from privatization would be retained for use by the other AIP-eligible airports. AIP spending is determined by the authorization and appropriations process, and Congress could choose to use any savings to reduce the program size, to marginally assist in deficit reduction, to reduce general fund portions of FAA operations funding, or to make money available for spending elsewhere. Debate over FAA reauthorization generally brings forth proposals to alter the AIP grant assurances, such as ensuring that workers on airport construction projects receive prevailing wages set under the Davis-Bacon Act and pledging to use airport revenue solely for spending on airport operations and capital costs. If AIP spending remains constrained, critics are likely to argue that the grant assurances raise the cost of projects to increase airport capacity and complicate the closure and reuse of underutilized airports or airports that are locally unpopular due to noise or safety concerns. Historically, a basic funding issue is whether to change the existing discretionary fund set-aside for noise mitigation and abatement. The noise set-aside, however, has been increased in previous reauthorization acts and is now 35% of discretionary funding. Demand to use AIP funds for noise mitigation could increase if Congress grants FAA the flexibility to fund noise mitigation projects that are outside the DNL 65 decibel (dB) noise impact area, but this could divert resources from capacity and safety projects. A related issue is whether to make the planning for noise-mitigating air traffic control procedures at individual airports eligible for AIP funding. The central issue related to PFCs is whether to raise the $4.50 per enplaned passenger ceiling or to eliminate the ceiling altogether. In general, airports argue for increasing or eliminating the ceiling, whereas most air carriers and some passenger advocates oppose higher limits on the PFCs. A 2015 GAO study analyzed the effects by raising the PFC cap under three scenarios: setting the cap at $6.47, $8.00, or $8.50. The study found raising PFC would significantly increase airport funding, but could also marginally slow passenger growth and therefore the growth in revenues to the trust fund. PFC supporters feel that the PFC is more reliable than AIP funding, which is subject to the authorization and appropriations process. They also argue that PFCs are procompetitive, helping airports build gates and facilities that both encourage new entrant carriers and allow incumbent carriers to expand. Advocates of an increase in the cap also argue that over time, the value of the PFC has been eroded by inflation and an adjustment is therefore necessary. The permissible uses of revenues are an ongoing point of contention. Airport operators, in particular, would like more freedom to use PFC funds for off-airport projects, such as transportation access projects, and want the process of obtaining FAA approval to be streamlined. Carriers, on the other hand, often complain that airports use PFC funds to finance proposals of dubious value, especially outside airport boundaries, instead of high-priority projects that offer meaningful safety or capacity enhancements. The major air carriers are also unhappy with their limited influence over project decisions, as airports are required only to consult with resident air carriers instead of having to get their agreement on PFC-funded projects. Unlike interest income from governmental bonds, which is not subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT), interest from private activity bonds is still subject to the AMT. ACI-NA has proposed broadening the definition of governmental airport bonds to, in effect, include either all airport bonds or at least those bonds issued for public-use projects that meet AIP or PFC eligibility requirements. Opponents of such changes express concerns that these changes would reduce U.S. Treasury revenues. Some also argue it would make more sense to change the AMT as part of a tax bill rather than including a specific exemption for income on airport bonds in an FAA reauthorization bill. In either case, such a change would not be under the jurisdiction of the congressional committees that will have jurisdiction over most reauthorization provisions. Changes to the AMT would be under the jurisdiction of the congressional tax-writing committees, the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance. Appendix A. Legislative History of Federal Grants-in-Aid to Airports Prior to World War II the federal government viewed airports as a local responsibility. During the 1930s, it spent about $150 million a year on airports through work relief agencies such as the Works Progress Administration (WPA). The first federal support for airport construction was granted during World War II. After the war, the Federal Airport Act of 1946 (P.L. 79-377) created the Federal Aid to Airports Program, using funds appropriated annually from the general fund. Initially much of this spending supported conversion of military airports to civilian use. In the 1960s substantial funding went to upgrade and extend runways for use by commercial jets. By the end of the 1960s, congestion, both in the air and on the ground at U.S. airports, was seen as evidence that airport capacity was inadequate. Airport and Airway Development and Revenue Acts of 1970 (P.L. 91-258) In 1970, Congress responded to the capacity concerns by passing two acts. The first, the Airport and Airway Development Act (Title I of P.L. 91-258), established the Airport Development Aid Program (ADAP) and the Planning Grant Program (PGP), and set forth the programs' grant criteria, distribution guidelines, and authorization of grant-in-aid funding for the first five years of the program. The second, the Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970 (Title II of P.L. 91-258), established the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Revenues from levies on aviation users and fuel were dedicated to the fund. Under the 1970 acts the trust fund could pay capital costs and, when excess funds existed, could also help cover FAA's administrative and operations costs. Airport and Airway Development and Revenue Acts Amendments of 1971 (P.L. 92-174) The Nixon Administration's FAA budget requests for FY1971 and FY1972 under the new trust fund system brought it into immediate conflict with Congress over the budgetary treatment of trust fund revenues. The Administration treated the new financing system as a user-pay system, whereas many Members of Congress viewed the trust fund as primarily a capital fund. The 1971 Amendments Act made the trust fund a capital-only account (although only through FY1976), disallowing the use of trust fund revenues for FAA operations. Airport and Airway Development Amendments Act of 1976 ( P.L. 94-353 ) The 1976 act made a number of adjustments to the ADAP and reauthorized the Airport and Airway Trust Fund through FY1980. The act again allowed the use of trust fund resources for the costs of air navigation services (a part of operations and maintenance). However, in an attempt to assure adequate funding of airport grants, the act included ""cap and penalty"" provisions which placed an annual cap on spending for costs of air navigation systems and a penalty that reduced these caps if airport grants were not funded each year at the airport program's authorized levels. This cap was altered multiple times in reauthorization acts in the following decades. ADAP grants totaled about $4.1 billion from 1971 through 1980. Congress did not pass authorizing legislation for ADAP during FY1981 and FY1982, during which the aviation trust fund lapsed, although spending for airport grants continued. Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 ( P.L. 97-248 ) The 1982 act created the current AIP and reactivated the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. It altered the funding distribution among the newly defined categories of airports, extending aid eligibility to privately owned general aviation airports, increasing the federal share of eligible project costs, and earmarking 8% of total funding for noise abatement and compatibility planning. The act also required the Secretary of Transportation to publish a national plan for the development of public-use airports in the United States. This biannual publication, the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS) , identifies airports that are considered important to the national aviation system. For an airport to receive AIP funds it must be listed in the NPIAS. Although the 1982 act was amended often in the 1980s and early 1990s, the general structure of AIP remained the same. The Airport and Airway Safety and Capacity Expansion Act of 1987 ( P.L. 100-223 ; 1987 act) authorized significant spending increases for AIP and added a cargo service apportionment. It also included provisions to encourage full funding of AIP at the authorized level. Title IX of P.L. 101-508 , the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA1990), included the Aviation and Airway Safety and Capacity Act of 1990, which allowed airports, under certain conditions, to levy a Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) to raise revenue and also established the Military Airport Program (MAP), which provided AIP funding for capacity and/or conversion-related projects at joint-use or former military airports. The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 (OBRA 1990, Title IX, Subtitle D) set a national aviation noise policy. OBRA1990 included the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990, which reauthorized the Aviation Trust Fund and adjusted some of the aviation taxes. The Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1994 ( P.L. 103-305 ) reauthorized AIP for two more years and again made modifications in the cap and penalty provisions. Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-264 ) The 1996 reauthorization of the AIP made a number of adjustments to entitlement funding and discretionary set-aside provisions. It also included directives concerning intermodal planning, cost reimbursement rules, letters of intent, and the small airport fund. A demonstration airport privatization program and a demonstration program for innovative financing techniques were established. The demonstration status of the state block grant program was removed. The act did not reauthorize the taxes that supported the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. This was done by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 ( P.L. 105-34 ), which extended, subject to a number of modifications, the existing aviation trust fund taxes through September 30, 2007. The Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21 st Century of 2000 (AIR21; P.L. 106-181 ) The enactment of AIR21 was the culmination of two years of legislative effort to pass a multiyear FAA reauthorization bill. The initial debate focused on provisions to take the aviation trust fund off-budget or erect budgetary ""firewalls"" to assure that all trust fund revenues and interest would be spent each year for aviation purposes. These proposals, however, never emerged from the conference committee. Instead, the enacted legislation included a so-called ""guarantee"" that all of each year's receipts and interest credited to the trust fund would be made available annually for aviation purposes. AIR21 did not make major changes in the structure or functioning of AIP. It did, however, greatly increase the amount available for airport development projects. The AIP funding authorization rose from $1.9 billion in FY2000 to $3.4 billion in FY2003. The formula funding and minimums for primary airports were doubled starting in FY2001. The state apportionment for general aviation airports was increased from 18.5% to 20%. The noise set-aside was increased from 31% to 34% of discretionary funding and a reliever airport discretionary set-aside of 0.66% was established. AIR21 also increased the PFC maximum to $4.50 per boarding passenger. In return for imposing a PFC above the $3 level, large and medium hub airports would forgo 75% of their AIP formula funds. This had the effect of making a greater share of AIP funding available to smaller airports. Vision 100: Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act of 2003 ( P.L. 108-176 ; H.Rept. 108-334 ) Vision 100, signed by President George W. Bush on December 12, 2003, included significant changes to AIP. The law codified the AIR21 spending ""guarantees"" through FY2007. It increased the discretionary set-aside for noise compatibility projects from 34% to 35%. It increased the amount that an airport participating in the Military Airport Program (MAP) could receive to $10 million for FY2004 and FY2005, but in FY2006 and FY2007 it returned the maximum funding level to $7 million. The act allowed nonprimary airports to use their entitlements for revenue-generating aeronautical support facilities, including fuel farms and hangars, if the Secretary of Transportation determines that the sponsor has made adequate provisions for the airside needs of the airport. The law permitted AIP grants at small airports to be used to pay interest on bonds issued to finance airport projects. The act included a trial program to test procedures for authorizing small airports to impose PFCs. Vision 100 repealed the authority to use AIP or PFC funds for most airport security purposes. FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 ( P.L. 112-95 ) The 2012 FAA reauthorization act funded AIP for four years from FY2012 to FY2015 at an annual level of $3.35 billion. A new provision, Section 138, permitted small airports reclassified as medium hubs due to increased passenger volumes to retain eligibility for up to a 90% federal share for a two-year transition period. This provision also allows certain economically distressed communities receiving subsidized air service to be eligible for up to a 95% federal share of project costs. The 2012 act maintained the $4.50 PFC cap, with a maximum charge of $18 per round-trip flight. It included a provision that instructed GAO to study alternative means for collecting PFCs. The act also expanded the number of airports that could participate in the airport privatization pilot program from 5 to 10. This law was extended through July 15, 2016. The FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 ( P.L. 114-190 ) The 2016 FAA extension act funded AIP through FY2017 at an annual level of $3.35 billion. A new provision, Section 2303, provided temporary relief to small airports that had 10,000 or more passenger boardings in 2012 but had fewer than 10,000 during the calendar year used to calculate the AIP apportionment for FY2017. This provision allowed such airports to receive apportionment for FY2017 an amount based on the number of passenger boardings at the airport during calendar year 2012. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 ( P.L. 115-254 ) The 2018 FAA reauthorization act funded AIP for five years from FY2019 through FY2023 at an annual level of $3.35 billion. It also authorized supplemental annual funding from the general fund to the AIP discretionary funds—$1.02 billion in FY2019, $1.04 billion in FY2020, $1.06 billion in FY2021, $1.09 billion in FY2022, and $1.11 billion in FY2023—and required at least 50% of the additional discretionary funds to be available to nonhub and small hub airports. The act included a provision permitting eligible projects at small airports (including those in the State Block Grant Program) to receive 95% federal share of project costs (otherwise capped at 90%), if such projects are determined to be successive phases of a multiphase construction project that received a grant in FY2011. The 2018 reauthorization expanded the number of states that could participate in the State Block Grant Program from 10 to 20 and also expanded the existing airport privatization pilot program (now renamed the Airport Investment Partnership Program) to include more than 10 airports. The law included a provision that forbids states or local governments from levying or collecting taxes on a business on an airport that ""is not generally imposed on sales or services by that State, political subdivision, or authority unless wholly utilized for airport or aeronautical purposes."" Appendix B. Definitions of Airports Included in the NPIAS Commercial Service Airports Publicly owned airports that receive scheduled passenger service and board at least 2,500 passengers each year (506 airports). Primary Airports . Airports that board more than 10,000 passengers each year. There are four subcategories: Large Hub Airports . Board 1% or more of system -wide boardings ( 30 airports, 72 % of all enplanements)Medium Hub Airports . Board 0.25% but less than 1% (31 airports, 16% of all enplanements) Small Hub Airports . Board 0.05% but less than 0.25% (72 airports, 8% of all enplanements) Non hub Primary Airports . Board more than 10,000 but less than 0.05% (247 airports, 3% of all enplanements) Non primary Commercial Service Airports . Board at least 2,500 but no more than 10,000 passengers each year (126 airports, 0.1% of all enplanements). Other Airports General Aviation Airports . General aviation airports do not receive scheduled commercial or military service but typically do support business, personal, and instructional flying; agricultural spraying; air ambulances; on-demand air-taxies; and/or charter aircraft service (2,554 airports). Reliever Airports . Airports designated by FAA to relieve congestion at commercial airports and provide improved general aviation access (261 airports). Cargo Service Airports . Airports served by aircraft that transport cargo only and have a total annual landed weight of over 100 million pounds. An airport may be both a commercial service and a cargo service airport. New Airports Seven airports are anticipated to be built between 2019 and 2023. They include two primary airports, two nonprimary commercial service airports, and three general aviation airports.\n\n","['There are five major sources of airport capital development funding: the federal Airport Improvement Program (AIP); local passenger facility charges (PFCs) imposed pursuant to federal law; tax-exempt bonds; state and local grants; and airport operating revenue from tenant lease and other revenue-generating activities such as landing fees. Federal involvement is most consequential in AIP, PFCs, and tax-exempt financing. The AIP has been providing federal grants for airport development and planning since the passage of the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-248). AIP funding is usually spent on projects that support aircraft operations such as runways, taxiways, aprons, noise abatement, land purchase, and safety or emergency equipment. The funds obligated for AIP are drawn from the airport and airway trust fund, which is supported by a variety of user fees and fuel taxes. Different airports use different combinations of these sources depending on the individual airport\'s financial situation and the type of project being considered. Although smaller airports\' individual grants are of much smaller dollar amounts than the grants going to large and medium hub airports, the smaller airports are much more dependent on AIP to meet their capital needs. This is particularly the case for noncommercial airports, which received over 25% of AIP grants distributed in FY2018. Larger airports are much more likely to issue tax-exempt bonds or finance capital projects with the proceeds of PFCs. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-254) provided annual AIP funding of $3.35 billion from the airport and airway trust fund for five years from FY2019 to FY2023. The act left the basic structure of AIP unchanged, but authorized supplemental annual funding of over $1 billion from the general fund to the AIP discretionary funds, starting with $1.02 billion in FY2019, and required at least 50% of the additional discretionary funds to be available to nonhub and small hub airports. The act included a provision permitting eligible projects at small airports (including those in the State Block Grant Program) to receive a 95% federal share of project costs (otherwise capped at 90%), if such projects are determined to be successive phases of a multiphase construction project that received a grant in FY2011. The 2018 reauthorization expanded the number of states that could participate in the State Block Grant Program from 10 to 20 and also expanded the existing airport privatization pilot program (now renamed the Airport Investment Partnership Program) to include more than 10 airports. The law included a provision that forbids states or local governments from levying or collecting taxes on a business at an airport that ""is not generally imposed on sales or services by that State, political subdivision, or authority unless wholly utilized for airport or aeronautical purposes."" The airport improvement issues Congress generally faces in the context of FAA reauthorization include the following: Should airport development funding be increased or decreased? Should the $4.50 ceiling on PFCs be eliminated, raised, or kept as it is? Could AIP be restructured to address congestion at the busiest U.S. airports, or should a large share of AIP resources continue to go to noncommercial airports that lack other sources of funding? Should Congress set tighter limits on the purposes for which AIP and PFC funds may be spent? This report provides an overview of airport improvement financing, with emphasis on AIP and the related passenger facility charges. It also discusses some ongoing airport issues that are likely to be included in a future FAA reauthorization debate.']","9366","gov_report","en","None","14fff932d702f49ba8037e3853528f5c24952fea97e12075","Summary:","gov_report","532","\n\nThe federal government plays"
"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nDOD’s MILCON appropriations are used to fund the acquisition, construction, installation, and equipping of temporary or permanent public works, military installations, facilities, and real property needed to support U.S. military forces in the United States and overseas. As with other DOD activities, no funds may be appropriated in any fiscal year or obligated or expended for MILCON activities unless such funds have been specifically authorized by law. Each year, the National Defense Authorization Act authorizes amounts to be appropriated in each of the 18 programmatic MILCON appropriations accounts. Individual or conference committee reports accompanying each fiscal year’s National Defense Authorization Act provide specific congressional direction on authorized funding levels designated for specific construction projects supported by the various MILCON accounts. Similarly, conference committee reports or explanatory statements accompanying each fiscal year’s appropriations acts establish appropriated funding levels for MILCON projects. The process through which the active component requests funding for construction projects is supported by DOD’s Form 1391 Military Construction Project Data (Form 1391). The Form 1391 is to be used to support each project proposed for inclusion in the MILCON appropriations request submitted concurrently with all other DOD appropriations requests annually. The forms are to be used for both new projects as well as urgent unforeseen projects. The Form 1391 describes the scope, total project costs, and estimates of specific project elements. Costs associated with other project elements such as contingency and supervision, inspection, and design are also to be captured and included in the total requested amount. Finally, the Form 1391 is to include a description of the proposed construction and a requirements statement indicating what requirement the project provides. Project budget estimates are initially developed at the installation level and are provided to the next responsible level for review, validation, refinement, prioritization, and approval. Administrative support is to be provided when requested across the departments, but ultimately the installation is the originator and the primary responsible entity in developing the completed Form 1391. MILCON appropriations are generally available for obligation for 5 fiscal years, at which time the appropriation expires. For 5 years after they expire, appropriations are available for limited purposes, such as liquidating obligations made during the period of availability or adjusting contract costs. After these 5 years, any remaining unexpended amounts, whether obligated or unobligated, are canceled and returned to the U.S. Treasury. Once funds are returned to the U.S. Treasury, they are no longer available for any purposes. DOD obligates its appropriations throughout the period in which the appropriation is available. An “unobligated balance” is the difference between the total appropriation amount and total obligations made against the appropriated amounts. An “unexpended balance” is the total of obligated but unliquidated and unobligated amounts. According to DOD officials, available but unobligated amounts no longer needed may be either rescinded by Congress or reprogrammed to other MILCON projects that the active component identifies as needing additional funding. Reprogrammed amounts may be used to fund other projects where there are shortfalls; for projects authorized by Congress but not specifically funded through the appropriations process; for emergency projects, such as for facilities destroyed by fires. DOD’s flexibility to reprogram without congressional approval is limited by the amount to be reprogrammed to a particular project. DOD’s Financial Management Regulation requires prior congressional approval for a reprogramming that would result in an increase exceeding 25 percent of a project’s authorized base amount or $2 million, whichever is less. Prior approval is not required when established costs or project-related thresholds are not reached. According to DOD officials, reprogrammings requiring congressional approval are called “above-threshold reprogrammings” and those that do not are called “below-threshold reprogrammings.” DOD designates construction agents for the military departments and defense agencies with primary responsibility for developing and refining MILCON proposals and cost estimates, and to manage the design and construction of projects. Typically, the Army Corps of Engineers is the construction agent for Army MILCON-funded projects and the Naval Facilities Engineering Command is the construction agent for Navy and Marine Corps MILCON-funded projects. Either of those DOD entities can be the construction agent for the defense agencies and activities, such as for the Missile Defense Agency or Defense Education Activity, with the approval of the military department having jurisdiction of the real property facility. However, both the Army and the Navy may use each other’s construction agent if it is in the interest of efficiency and cost- effectiveness or when otherwise considered appropriate. The Air Force may use either the Army Corps of Engineers or Naval Facilities Engineering Command for its projects. Additionally, the Air Force Civil Engineer Center, although not a designated construction agent, reviews and approves requirements for Air Force MILCON cost estimates, and in some cases may design and construct Air Force projects where both the Air Force and the commander of the assigned construction agent agree that it is the most efficient, expeditious, and cost-effective means to complete the project. Within DOD there are two levels of military construction guidance: the Unified Facilities Criteria and component-level guidance. The Unified Facilities Criteria are overarching, DOD-wide technical manuals and standards used for planning, design, construction, restoration, and maintenance of DOD facility projects. The Unified Facilities Criteria was designed to standardize and streamline the process for developing, maintaining, and disseminating criteria in support of MILCON. The Unified Facilities Criteria contains guidance describing methods, procedures, and formats for the preparation of construction cost estimates and construction contract modification estimates, among other types of guidance. The Unified Facilities Criteria is to be used to the greatest extent possible by all the DOD regardless of funding source. In addition to the Unified Facilities Criteria, the military departments and agencies have also developed their own internal guidance on MILCON, providing further direction on conducting activities such as cost analysis and determining facility requirements. We developed the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide: Best Practices for Developing and Managing Capital Program Costs (Cost Guide) to assist federal agencies in developing reliable cost estimates and also as a tool for evaluating existing cost estimating procedures. To develop the Cost Guide, our cost experts assessed measures applied by cost estimating organizations throughout the federal government and industry and considered best practices for the development of reliable cost estimates. While the Cost Guide has a focus on developing cost estimates in the context of government acquisition programs, it outlines best practices that are generally applicable to cost estimation in a variety of circumstances. These best practices can be used to assess (1) the specific project cost estimates an agency develops to determine whether they meet the four characteristics—comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible—for being reliable and (2) an agency’s cost estimating guidance and procedures to see how well they incorporate all the steps needed for producing a high-quality cost estimate. Figure 1 shows the four characteristics and associated best practices for each that define a reliable cost estimate and table 1 shows the 12 steps identified in the Cost Guide that, if followed correctly, should result in high-quality cost estimates that management can use for making informed decisions. During fiscal years 2005 through 2016, Congress appropriated about $66 billion in MILCON funds to the active component and, as of September 30, 2016, the active component had obligated all but about $5.1 billion and expended all but about $11 billion of those funds. Of the $5.1 billion that remains unobligated, about $4.6 billion was unexpired and available for new obligations (i.e., from fiscal year 2013 through 2016 appropriations). Table 2 shows the active component’s combined MILCON appropriations, obligations, and unexpended funds from fiscal year 2005 through fiscal year 2016. In general, during the early first few years of a MILCON appropriation available for 5 years, it is often likely that most of the funds will remain unobligated. For example, as shown in table 2 above, of the nearly $3.9 billion appropriated for military construction for the active component from the fiscal year 2016-2020 appropriation, only about $1.1 billion had been obligated as of September 30, 2016. This is not surprising given the time that it takes to award, obligate and disburse funds for projects. Ultimately, though, as an appropriation nears its expiration date, all or nearly all of the amounts have generally been obligated. In fact, as shown in table 2, for each MILCON appropriation received by the active component prior to fiscal year 2013 (fiscal years 2005 through 2012), less than 2 percent of each year’s appropriation was unexpended as of September 30, 2016. In appendix II, we provide additional analysis of the active component’s unexpended and unobligated balances, by appropriation year and by military department. Although ultimately, the active component obligates and expends most of its MILCON appropriations, the active component can experience a wide range of differences between initial cost estimates and final costs during the execution of individual MILCON projects, resulting in savings or shortfalls depending on the project. For example, we found that from fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2016, the active component achieved about $4.2 billion in MILCON project savings as a result, for example, of canceled projects, projects with lower than expected contractor bids, or the use of less expensive building materials. In appendix III, we provide additional analysis of the active component’s estimated initial costs and the contract award amounts that were funded by MILCON appropriations for fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2016. The active component reprogrammed about $1.6 billion in MILCON appropriations to fund shortfalls caused by emergency projects, projects that were authorized but did not receive specific appropriations, and projects needing additional funding in fiscal years 2010 through 2016. Of this amount, the Army reprogrammed about $789 million of about $14 billion in appropriated MILCON funds; the Navy, about $535 million of about $14 billion in appropriated MILCON funds; and the Air Force, about $295 million of about $7 billion in appropriated MILCON funds. Table 3 shows the number and amounts of above-threshold reprogrammings by the active component for fiscal years 2010 through 2016. As seen in table 3, for any given year there are typically hundreds of millions of dollars reprogrammed. There are generally multiple active or canceled projects that result in cost savings, which may be used to fund authorized but not specifically funded projects. Below are three examples where the active component funded MILCON projects with amounts reprogrammed from other projects: Repair Shop at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam: This is an Air Force project to construct a pacific air resiliency low observable/corrosion control/composite repair shop in Guam. It is an authorized project that did not receive specific funding during the appropriation process but was fully funded by reprogrammed cost savings from active construction projects. Congress authorized $34.4 million for the repair shop in fiscal year 2015; however, no funds were specifically appropriated for the project. According to Air Force officials, since this was their top unfunded military construction priority, they used $34.4 million in savings achieved from other projects to construct the repair shop. Table 4 lists the three projects whose MILCON funds were reprogrammed for the repair shop at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. Training Facility at the Naval Air Station at Mayport, Florida: This is a Navy project to construct a littoral combat ship training facility in Florida. It is a specifically funded project requiring additional funds that received reprogrammed amounts from a canceled project. In fiscal year 2014, the initial cost as listed on the Form 1391 was estimated to be $20.5 million, but project costs increased by 41 percent to an estimated $28.9 million, according to a fiscal year 2016 reprogramming request to Congress. As detailed in the reprogramming request, the Navy attributed the increased cost to underestimated mission simulator and communication line requirements. To fund the increased costs, the Navy used $8.3 million in savings from a canceled project to complete the facility. Table 5 lists the canceled project that resulted in funds being reprogrammed for the training facility at Mayport. Barracks at Presidio of Monterey, California: This is an Army project to construct a trainee barracks in California. It is a specifically funded project in need of additional funds that received reprogrammed amounts from active and canceled construction projects. In fiscal year 2011, the initial cost for the project as listed on the Form 1391 was estimated to be $63 million, but project costs increased by 51 percent to $95 million, according to a fiscal year 2015 reprogramming request to Congress. As detailed in the reprogramming request, the Army attributed the increased costs to a 3-year delay in construction and the need to move the project to a small, steep-terrain site. The reprogramming request further noted that the delay in construction was due to the discovery at the proposed construction site of a seismic fault and a plant that is an endangered species. To fund the increased costs, the Army sought to reprogram funds from the savings achieved from the active and canceled projects. Table 6 lists the projects that generated the reprogrammed funds used for the barracks at Presidio. Our analyses of the cost estimates for three selected projects shows that the cost estimates were not reliable, and DOD’s cost estimating guidance does not fully incorporate all the steps needed for producing reliable estimates. We examined the cost estimates of three high-value military construction projects and noted that the initial cost estimates increased for all three projects, with cost estimates for two of the projects increasing by over 30 percent and the other, by about 7 percent. Specifically: Strategic Command Operations Building, Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. The project to construct a nuclear, space, and network command and control operations building for the command at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska, increased from an initial cost estimate in fiscal year 2012 of $564 million to $601 million in fiscal year 2014 (or a 7-percent increase). According to a fiscal year 2014 reprogramming request to Congress, the Air Force attributed the increased cost to the fact that the project team did not appreciate the full scope, complexity, and risk of such an information technology- intensive project. These cost issues are similar to challenges we have reported on for other information technology-intensive MILCON projects. The Air Force is the project owner and the Army Corps of Engineers is the construction agent for this project. Command Headquarters and Cyberspace Operations Building, Fort Meade, Maryland. The project to construct a command headquarters and cyberspace operations building with sensitive compartmented information facility in Fort Meade, Maryland, increased from an initial cost estimate in fiscal year 2013 of $84 million to $110 million in fiscal year 2015 (or a 31-percent increase). As detailed in the fiscal year 2015 reprogramming request, the Navy attributed the increased cost to higher than expected construction costs due to increased demand on the labor workforce in the Washington, D.C./Baltimore area and underestimated electrical power requirements. The Navy is the project owner and the Army Corps of Engineers is the construction agent for this project. Elementary School Camp Foster, Japan. The project to replace an elementary school at Camp Foster, Japan increased from an initial cost estimate in fiscal year 2012 of $79 million to $107 million in fiscal year 2014 (or a 35-percent increase). As detailed on the fiscal year 2014 reprogramming request, the Department of Defense Education Activity attributed the increased cost to the volatile construction climate in Japan caused by natural disasters; Japanese government policies, economic stimulus, and reform; and the planned developments for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. Although this project is not owned by any of the military departments, it is being managed by the Army Corps of Engineers in its role as a DOD construction agent through which it plays an important role in the development of the construction cost estimate. The Department of Defense Education Activity is the project owner and the Army Corps of Engineers is the construction agent. To determine the reliability of the cost estimates for these three selected projects, we assessed the cost estimates against the best practices for developing a reliable estimate in our Cost Guide. As previously discussed, the Cost Guide defines the four characteristics— comprehensive, well documented, accurate, and credible—of a reliable cost estimate and the associated best practices related to each characteristic. In conducting these assessments, we examined both the Form 1391 estimate (i.e., the estimate used to develop the budget) and the independent government estimate i.e., (the estimate used to award the contract) for each project. Our analysis of the cost estimates for the three selected projects shows that the cost estimators did not follow all the best practices listed for each of the four characteristics. As a result, none of the characteristics were fully or substantially met. To be reliable, a cost estimate must substantially or fully meet each of the four characteristics. As the Cost Guide states, if any of the characteristics are not met, minimally met, or partially met, then the cost estimate does not fully reflect the characteristics of a high-quality estimate and cannot be considered reliable. Table 7 provides the results of our assessment of the cost estimates for each of the three selected projects. The Cost Guide also identifies 12 steps that, when incorporated into an agency’s cost estimating procedures and guidance, are more likely to result in reliable and valid cost estimates. However, our analysis of DOD’s department-wide cost estimating guidance—the Unified Facilities Criteria—found that the criteria did not include all of these 12 steps. The Unified Facilities Criteria incorporates some of the 12 steps to some degree, but not others, and as a result DOD is at a greater risk of developing estimates that are not reliable. Table 8 provides our assessment of the extent to which DOD’s Unified Facilities Criteria incorporates the 12 steps needed to develop a high-quality, reliable cost estimate. Each of the military departments is required to follow the Unified Facilities Criteria to the greatest extent possible when designing and constructing facilities. However, as shown by the table above, there are shortcomings in these criteria when compared with our Cost Guide. Despite these shortcomings, the military departments have gone beyond the Unified Facilities Criteria and developed their own guidance that more closely aligns with our Cost Guide. For example, for both the “determining the estimating structure” and “obtain the data” steps, we found that all three military departments had developed their own guidance that more closely aligned with the 12 steps than the Unified Criteria did. In addition, some military departments are also making improvements to their cost estimating processes, but these improvements have not been fully implemented yet. For example, the Air Force Civil Engineer Center is implementing a cost estimate improvement plan to include the training of nearly 700 airmen and has conducted a study that directly ties the 12 steps in the Cost Guide to the associated tasks to be completed by the Air Force cost estimator to meet each individual step. However, the actions contained in the cost improvement plan have not been fully implemented and still remain in the concept phase. Similarly, although the Army Corps of Engineers is investigating expanding the use the of cost and schedule risk analysis—which could align with the best practices in the Cost Guide—that the Army currently conducts for selected civil work construction projects to its high-cost military construction projects, the Army has not formally required the use of these tools. In appendix IV, we describe the guidance the military departments have developed beyond the Unified Facilities Criteria. The Cost Guide is designed to establish a consistent methodology that is based on best practices and that can be used across the federal government for developing, managing, and evaluating capital program cost estimates. Air Force and Army Corps of Engineers officials noted that there may be instances in which following all the 12 steps of the Cost Guide for every MILCON project would not be appropriate to the risk level of the project. For example, it may not be realistic or to the military departments’ benefit for the military departments to conduct a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis or develop an independent cost estimate for all the construction projects they initiate every year, especially for low-cost projects. We agree that it may not be suitable to fully apply all 12 of the cost estimating steps in the Cost Guide to all MILCON projects. However, incorporating the 12 steps into the Unified Facilities Criteria would establish consistency across DOD in the cost estimating process by ensuring that, for each MILCON project, each step in the Cost Guide would at least be considered. Furthermore, DOD could choose to establish thresholds—based on, for example, the dollar values of the projects—to guide the services in implementing the 12 steps for the most valuable projects. Skipping or not considering any step of the 12-step cost estimating process, especially for high-value projects such as those in our case studies, increases the risk that cost estimates may use improper assumptions, lack appropriate definition, or be otherwise unreliable. Without improving the Unified Facilities Criteria with respect to cost estimating processes, DOD and the services will not be positioned well to provide reliable cost estimates to DOD and congressional decision- makers. Each year DOD receives billions of dollars in MILCON appropriations to use for projects in the United States and overseas. The quality of project cost estimates are of great importance since those estimates are the basis for DOD’s requests for appropriations. While DOD’s policy is that MILCON cost estimates be prepared as accurately as possible in order to reflect the full cost of constructing DOD facilities, DOD’s Unified Facilities Criteria—the department’s primary construction criteria for developing cost estimates—does not fully incorporate all of the steps needed for producing reliable cost estimates. Until DOD incorporates the 12 steps of high-quality, reliable cost estimating into this department-wide construction criteria, DOD and congressional decision-makers may not have reliable estimates to inform their decisions regarding appropriations and the oversight of projects. We are making one recommendation to DOD: The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and the Environment work with DOD’s construction agents, military departments, and other offices to improve DOD’s MILCON cost estimating guidance (i.e., DOD’s Unified Facilities Criteria) by fully incorporating all the steps needed for developing high- quality reliable cost estimates. (Recommendation 1) We provided a draft of this report to DOD. In written comments, which are reprinted in their entirety in appendix VI, DOD partially concurred with our recommendation. DOD also provided technical comments that have been incorporated into the report as appropriate. DOD partially concurred with our recommendation to improve its cost estimating guidance by fully incorporating all 12 steps needed for developing high-quality, reliable estimates. DOD stated that it did not believe that it is suitable to fully apply all 12 steps to any construction project due to characteristics of the military construction program that DOD believes differ from those of major system or weapon acquisition programs. However, DOD also stated that it concurred with the intent and general applicability of the twelve steps to military construction and that DOD cost estimating guidance lacks specificity in several of these areas. DOD acknowledged that expanding its cost guidance to more fully incorporate these steps would benefit the military construction program, and that it is planning to address this by revising its cost guidance during Fiscal Year 2019. In our report, we recognize that it may not be appropriate to fully apply all 12 steps to each construction project. For example, it may not be realistic or to the military departments’ benefit to conduct a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis or develop an independent cost estimate for all the construction projects they initiate every year, especially for low-cost projects. Accordingly, we did not recommend that DOD fully apply all 12 steps to each construction project, but rather that it fully incorporate the 12 steps into the Unified Facilities Criteria so that, at least, each step is considered for each project. DOD could then choose to establish thresholds—based on, for example, the dollar values of the projects—to determine for which the 12 steps should be fully applied or other circumstances in which some steps might not be applicable. We believe DOD’s planned revisions will meet the general intent of our recommendation. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees; the Secretary of Defense, the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.

GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix VI. To examine the active component’s military construction (MILCON) obligations and expended balances, we reviewed MILCON appropriations found in appropriations acts, including accompanying explanatory statements and conference committee reports from fiscal year 2005 through 2016. Further, we analyzed the obligation and disbursement data of the active component‘s MILCON accounts, appropriation status reports, bid savings reports, as well as annual reports from the U.S. Department of the Treasury. We also collected and compared project data from each of the active component on projects that had been initiated and completed during fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2016. Specifically, we compared the initial estimate as shown on the Form 1391—the form DOD uses to submit requirements and justifications in support of its funding requests to Congress—with the contract award amount and analyzed any differences between the two. To examine the amount of MILCON reprogramming during fiscal years 2010 and 2016 by the active component, we reviewed DOD’s requests to Congress to reprogram MILCON funds from one project to another. We calculated the total number of times such requests were made and the dollar amounts for fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2016. We selected this time frame because the reprogramming requests were readily available from DOD. In addition, we judgmentally selected three projects from this same time frame and reviewed accompanying Forms 1391 and the reprogramming requests associated with the projects to illustrate instances in which savings from one MILCON project funded another project. We collected and analyzed data for fiscal years 2005 through 2016 on the active component MILCON appropriations, obligations, and disbursements and we collected reprogramming data for fiscal years 2010 through 2016. We assessed the reliability of the data by interviewing knowledgeable officials about the data and the steps that they had taken to verify the data’s accuracy. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our objectives. To determine the extent to which DOD’s MILCON cost estimates are reliable and DOD’s guidance for producing estimates fully incorporates all of the steps needed for developing reliable estimates, we compared the process for developing three selected projects with the characteristics and best practices for developing a reliable estimate identified in GAO’s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide: Best Practices for Developing and Managing Capital Program Costs (the Cost Guide). This guide is a compilation of cost estimating best practices drawn from across industry and federal government. We selected our projects from the universe of projects that we reasonably expected could have begun execution (i.e., projects initiated during fiscal years 2012-2014); projects that were underway, but not substantially completed (i.e., between 10- and 75- percent complete); and projects that constituted a significant financial investment (i.e., projects with appropriations of $75 million or greater). Ultimately, of 690 total projects we identified DOD-wide, 13 met these criteria and, from this sample, we selected the 3 projects included in this report: (1) the construction of a replacement elementary school at Camp Foster, Japan; (2) the construction of a Strategic Command operations building at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska; and (3) the construction of a Marine Corps command headquarters and cyberspace operations building in Fort Meade, Maryland. In conducting the assessments for these three selected projects, we examined the processes used to develop both the Form 1391 estimate (i.e the form DOD uses to submit project-level requirements and justifications in support of its MILCON funding requests to Congress ) and the independent government estimate (i.e., the estimate used to award the contract) to determine whether the project cost estimates had the characteristics of a high-quality and reliable cost estimate, as defined in the Cost Guide. These projects are not intended to be a projectable sample, but to illustrate how cost estimates are assessed against best practices. Although the Camp Foster project is not owned by any of the active component, the construction and planning of the project is being led by the Army Corps of Engineers in its capacity as a DOD construction agent and, as such, we decided to include it in our review. Additionally, we reviewed DOD’s Unified Facilities Criteria and the active component’s respective guidance related to MILCON cost estimating and compared them with the steps needed for developing reliable estimates identified in the Cost Guide. We also interviewed military project cost estimators and active component construction agents to discuss the requirements and guidance they follow in preparing, documenting, and reviewing project cost estimates. Table 9 details the documents we reviewed for our cost estimating assessments. We conducted this performance audit from January 2016 to March 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. In this appendix we provide the supporting details on the active component’s unobligated and unexpended balances of military construction (MILCON) appropriations for fiscal years 2005 through 2016. We include details on unobligated and unexpended balances by appropriation year and include individual tables for each military department of the active component. Overall, the active component had high obligation and expenditure rates associated with MILCON appropriations that have expired or been canceled. The Army, the Air Force, and the Navy consistently expended over 90 percent of amounts appropriated in fiscal years 2005 through 2011. This appendix also provides supporting details on the active component’s execution of MILCON appropriations for fiscal years 2010 through 2016. Using Department of Defense (DOD) data, we identified two groups of MILCON projects: congressionally directed and other. “Congressionally directed” projects are those MILCON projects specifically identified in an appropriation act, explanatory statement, and/or committee reports accompanying the appropriation act for a specific fiscal year. “Other” projects refer to congressionally directed MILCON projects identified in an appropriation act, explanatory statement, and/or conference committee reports in a previous fiscal year. Overall, the active component obligated about 89 percent of its fiscal years 2010 through 2012 appropriations for congressionally directed projects whose appropriations expired on September 30, 2017. Tables 10 through 12 present detailed information on unexpended and unobligated balances for each military department of the active component’s MILCON appropriation for fiscal years 2005 through 2016, as reported by DOD as of September 30, 2016. Table 10 shows that for fiscal years 2005 through 2012, the Army expended almost all of its MILCON appropriations. Specifically, with the exception of fiscal year 2012, the Army expended at least 90 percent of its appropriations received each fiscal year for 2005 through 2011. Unexpended rates for amounts appropriated for fiscal years 2014 through 2016 vary and unobligated amounts for these years remain available for new obligations. Table 11 shows that, for fiscal years 2005 through 2013, the Air Force expended almost all of its MILCON appropriations. Specifically, the Air Force expended at least 95 percent of its appropriations received each year for fiscal years 2005 through 2011 and also in fiscal year 2013. Unexpended rates for amounts appropriated for fiscal years 2014 through 2016 vary and unobligated amounts for these years remain available for new obligations. Table 12 shows that for fiscal years 2005 through 2012, the Navy expended almost all of its MILCON appropriations. Specifically, the Navy expended at least 90 percent of its appropriations received each fiscal year for 2005 through 2011. Unexpended rates for amounts appropriated for fiscal years 2014 through 2016 vary and unobligated amounts for these years remain available for new obligations. Tables 13 through 15 provide detailed information on budget execution for each active duty military department’s MILCON appropriation for “congressionally directed” and “other” MILCON projects for fiscal years 2010 through 2016, as reported by DOD as of September 30, 2016. Table13 shows the obligations made by the Army for MILCON appropriations for fiscal years 2010 through 2016. We analyzed the obligations made during these appropriations’ period of availability for congressionally directed and other MILCON projects. For fiscal year 2010, using data in the table, we found that about 97.2 percent of obligations were for congressionally directed projects and 2.8 percent were for other projects, as discussed above. In fiscal year 2011, about 94 percent of obligations were for congressionally directed projects and 4.2 percent were for other projects; and in fiscal year 2012, about 86.5 percent of obligations were for congressionally directed projects and 7.2 percent were for other projects. Table 14 shows the obligations made by the Air Force for MILCON appropriations for fiscal years 2010 through 2016. We analyzed the obligations made during these appropriations’ period of availability for congressionally directed and other MILCON projects. For fiscal year 2010, using the data listed in the table, we found that 90.5 percent of obligations were for congressionally directed projects and 7.3 percent were for other projects, as discussed above. In fiscal year 2011, about 84.3 percent of obligations were for congressionally directed projects and 12.9 percent were for other projects; and in fiscal year 2012, about 87.5 percent of obligations were for congressionally directed projects and 9.0 percent were for other projects. Table 15 shows the obligations made by the Navy for MILCON appropriations for fiscal years 2010 through 2016. We analyzed the obligations made during these appropriations’ period of availability for congressionally directed and other MILCON projects. For fiscal year 2010, using data in the table, we found that 84.7 percent of obligations were for congressionally directed projects and 15.0 percent were for other projects, as discussed above. In fiscal year 2011, about 87.7 percent of obligations were for congressionally directed projects and 11.8 percent were for other projects; and in fiscal year 2012, about 85.5 percent of obligations were for congressionally directed projects and 13.4 percent for other projects. This appendix provides information on our analysis of DOD’s estimated initial costs and contract award amounts of projects that had been initiated and completed during fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2016 by the active component. An official from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment told us that, to determine whether initial cost estimates were over- or underestimated, a comparison between initial Form 1391 estimates and contract award amounts would be a valid approach since contract award amounts are, in general, estimates of the same requirements identified on a Form 1391. The official also noted that supervision, inspection, overhead, and contingency costs included on a Form 1391 are not included in contract award amounts, which could create differences between the Form 1391 cost estimates and contract award prices. Because of this, we excluded the supervision, inspection, overhead, and contingency costs from the Form 1391 estimates in the table below to eliminate those differences. Form 1391 cost estimates may also vary from contract award amounts for reasons such as changes in project size or scope, changes in project characteristics, unexpectedly high or low contractor bids, or differences in expected building material costs, among other things. A negative percent change from the Form 1391 estimate to the contract award amount indicates the estimated project cost was overestimated and a positive percent change indicates the project was underestimated. We did not determine the precise reasons for any differences between estimated costs and contract award amounts. Table 16 lists information on 414 completed projects funded with military construction (MILCON) appropriations during fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2016 sorted by largest percentage overestimated to largest percentage underestimated. The military departments of the active component have gone beyond the Unified Facilities Criteria and developed their own guidance for military construction (MILCON) that more closely aligns with the 12 steps needed for developing high-quality, reliable estimates. Table 17 describes the guidance developed by the military departments to align with those steps. In addition to the contact named above, Maria Storts, Assistant Director; Bonita Anderson; Shawn Arbogast; Ronald Bergman; Brian Bothwell; Robert Brown; Farrah Graham; Mae Jones; Jennifer Leotta; Amie Lesser; Felicia Lopez; Carol Petersen; Vikki Porter; Steve Pruitt; and Karen Richey made key contributions to this report.\n\n","[""Between fiscal years 2005 and 2016, Congress annually appropriated between $2.5 to $9.6 billion in MILCON funding for the active component of the U.S. military to use for projects worldwide. Reliable project construction cost estimates are of great importance, since those estimates drive these appropriations. House Report 114-537 accompanying a proposed bill authorizing national defense activities for fiscal year 2017 included a provision for GAO to report on DOD's MILCON cost estimating. This report examines the extent to which (1) the active component obligated and expended the MILCON appropriations received during fiscal years 2005-2016, (2) the active component reprogrammed MILCON appropriations during fiscal years 2010 through 2016, and (3) DOD's MILCON cost estimates are reliable for selected projects and DOD's guidance for developing estimates fully incorporates the steps needed for developing reliable estimates. GAO analyzed the active components' MILCON execution data and reviewed DOD's guidance for cost estimating and compared it with the best practices identified in GAO's Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide . During fiscal years 2005 through 2016, Congress appropriated about $66 billion in military construction funds (MILCON) to the active duty Army, Navy, and Air Force (referred to as the active component) for projects. As of September 30, 2016, the active component had obligated all but about $5.1 billion and expended all but about $11 billion of those funds. Of the $5.1 billion remaining unobligated, about $4.6 billion was still available to be obligated because MILCON appropriations are generally available for new obligations for 5 years. According to Department of Defense (DOD) officials, available but unobligated amounts no longer needed may be either taken back by Congress or reprogrammed to other MILCON projects that the active component identifies as needing additional funding. During fiscal years 2010 through 2016, the active component reprogrammed about $1.6 billion in MILCON appropriations to fund emergency projects, projects that were authorized but did not receive specific appropriations, and projects needing additional funding. Of this amount, the Army reprogrammed about $789 million; the Navy, about $535 million; and the Air Force, about $295 million. DOD's guidance does not fully incorporate the steps needed for developing reliable estimates and the estimates for three projects that GAO reviewed were not reliable. Specifically, two of the three high-value projects GAO examined experienced a more than 30-percent increase from the initial cost estimates submitted to Congress. GAO determined that DOD cost estimators did not follow all the best practices associated with the four characteristics—comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible—of a reliable estimate for these projects. GAO's Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide identifies 12 steps that, if used, are more likely to result in reliable and valid cost estimates. However, as shown below, DOD's construction guidance—the Unified Facilities Criteria—does not include all of these steps. Until DOD incorporates these steps, DOD and congressional decision-makers may not have reliable estimates to inform their decisions regarding appropriations and the oversight of projects. GAO recommends that DOD ensure that its cost estimating guidance fully incorporate the steps needed for developing reliable cost estimates. DOD partially concurred with GAO's recommendation and stated that it will issue revised cost guidance in fiscal year 2019 that more fully incorporates those steps that would benefit the military construction program.""]","6142","gov_report","en","None","cde0dd328fcfff44d9709e0e3b6e07100b1d23ebc8208f78","Summary:","gov_report","532","\n\nThe report examines the Department of Defense's (DOD) Military Const"

Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nTo participate in federal student aid programs, postsecondary schools must be 1) certified by Education as eligible to participate in federal student aid programs, 2) accredited by a recognized accrediting agency— generally nongovernmental, nonprofit entities—and 3) authorized by the state in which the school is physically located. (See table 1.) FSA is responsible for ensuring that schools with access to federal student aid are eligible and capable of properly administering federal student aid funds, according to standards established by Education and authorized by the Higher Education Act. These standards include requirements for schools related to communication, personnel, policies, procedures and reporting, and adequate checks and balances in a system of internal controls, among others. FSA is also responsible for conducting ongoing financial oversight of schools that receive federal student aid. This includes reviewing annual financial statement audits to assess a school’s financial responsibility and providing additional oversight to schools that do not meet financial responsibility standards outlined in the Higher Education Act. Schools that participate in federal student aid programs generally are required to submit annual compliance audits. The compliance audit provides information that FSA can use to assess the school’s administration of federal student aid programs and to identify schools that require additional oversight because they do not fully comply with federal student aid administrative requirements. The OIG is required to assess the quality of school compliance audits and selects a sample to review each year. The OIG reviews the audit documentation to ensure that it supports the auditor’s opinions and that the audit results are reliable. According to agency guidance, FSA staff should refer compliance audits to the OIG for a quality review if they have any concerns about the quality of the audits. Both FSA and OIG officials stated that the OIG has primary responsibility for issues related to audit quality. When a school first applies to be certified to administer federal student aid, FSA will either approve the school for provisional certification— generally for 1 year—or deny certification (see fig. 1). Once a school is approved for initial certification and applies for recertification, FSA will provisionally or fully recertify the school, or deny certification. According to FSA procedures, FSA uses provisional certification for initial, or first time, applicants, as well as schools that are applying for recertification. Provisional certification is the only approval status available to new schools. In addition, FSA may decide to recertify a school provisionally if it determines that a school has not fully complied with federal student aid requirements. FSA prohibits provisionally certified schools from opening new campus locations or offering new programs without approval from FSA, and provisionally certified schools that are denied recertification have a less substantive appeals process than fully certified schools. Further, recertified schools in provisional status are subject to more FSA oversight than schools that are fully certified. FSA procedures allow for some discretion in determining for how long to certify a school. Provisional recertification generally lasts 1 to 3 years, while full recertification generally lasts 4 to 6 years. Education’s FSA regional staff draw information from a variety of sources during the certification process to assess a school’s capability to administer federal student aid. According to FSA documents, regional staff are to review information collected from schools and third parties, such as annual compliance audits conducted by independent auditors, among other information sources. FSA staff responsible for different functional areas, such as financial and compliance audits, accreditation status, and student loan default rates, compile and review information on schools, according to FSA procedures. FSA officials told us that these staff meet to discuss any potential program eligibility issues and to ensure that all information relevant to a school is considered before making a certification decision. FSA’s certification procedures outline some of the key information that regional staff should assess, some of which is relevant to both initial and recertification decisions, and some of which is specific to each type of certification process (see fig. 2). Documents and policies provided by schools: FSA regional staff are directed to review documents submitted by schools, including school catalogs, and certain school policies—such as admissions and student refund policies—that are relevant to assessing administrative capability. Proof of accreditation: School accreditors are responsible for applying and enforcing standards to help ensure that the education offered by schools is of sufficient quality to achieve program objectives. Accreditation of schools, which generally includes a site visit, takes place on a cycle that may range from every few years to as many as 10 years. Proof of state authorization: States are responsible for authorizing schools to offer postsecondary education and respond to student complaints. The process for approving schools varies from state to state and may include on-site visits. Audited financial statements: FSA regional staff are directed to review information in audited financial statements to assess schools’ financial health. Schools are required to have annual audited financial statements issued by an independent certified public accountant or a government auditor. Self-reported school data: FSA regional staff are instructed to review data on continual student enrollment in eligible academic programs and student withdrawal rates. Pre-certification review and school outreach: FSA staff are responsible for contacting school personnel to verify the school’s application information and discuss relevant policies, procedures, and other materials relevant to administering federal student aid. FSA visits to newly certified schools: After schools first apply and are provisionally certified, Education requires FSA regional staff to contact them within 3 months and schedule an on-site school visit. Schools cannot administer federal student aid until they are certified, so FSA has limited information on how newly certified schools are administering federal student aid programs. School visits provide FSA with an opportunity to collect additional information about a provisionally certified school’s ability to administer federal student aid. Some FSA regional staff we interviewed told us that on-site visits to newly certified schools provide valuable first-hand information about whether these schools are administering federal student aid in accordance with program requirements. If FSA regional staff find that a school is having difficulties administering federal student aid, FSA procedures direct regional staff to assist schools by providing clarification and guidance on federal student aid policies, recommending additional training for school officials, and helping schools develop a plan to track and report on their corrective actions, among other things. Compliance audits: FSA staff are directed to review information in compliance audits to determine if schools are complying with specific federal student aid requirements. Generally, compliance audits are required to be conducted annually by an independent auditor, and submitted with the school’s audited financial statements. Program reviews: FSA regional staff are also responsible for conducting program reviews, usually on site, which evaluate school compliance with federal requirements and can provide more in-depth information on schools than compliance audits, according to some FSA staff we interviewed. Generally, FSA selects schools for program reviews that it considers to be at risk for noncompliance, according to Education documents. FSA conducts approximately 250 to 300 program reviews per year, according to FSA documentation. FSA staff from all four of our selected regional offices told us they consider results from any recent program review in decisions about recertification and noted that such information, when available, is valuable for assessing schools’ administrative capability. Education data: FSA regional office staff are also directed to review data on student loan default rates. From calendar years 2006 through 2017, FSA approved most schools applying for certification to receive federal student aid, according to Education data. From 2006 through 2017, FSA approved 89 percent of schools new to administering federal student aid for provisional certification and denied 11 percent of schools overall (see fig. 3). Denial rates for initial certification were 11 percent for public and for-profit schools and 14 percent for nonprofit schools. For more information on 2006-2017 school certification outcomes by year, see appendix I. FSA regional staff responsible for reviewing school applications told us that schools are denied initial certification for issues such as a lack of accreditation, not offering eligible programs for federal student aid, or not meeting other statutory eligibility requirements. For example, FSA staff said that for-profit and vocational schools that apply for initial certification are required to provide an eligible program continuously for 2 years prior to their initial application. FSA staff may also advise schools that do not meet basic eligibility requirements not to apply, which could result in fewer initial certification denials overall. In addition, FSA staff said they often work with schools to address compliance problems, for example, by providing guidance on revising school policies that do not meet requirements, so that the schools are able to meet FSA’s certification requirements. From 2006 through 2017, 76 percent of schools applying for recertification were fully recertified, 21 percent were provisionally recertified, and 3 percent were denied recertification. Sixty-six percent of for-profit schools were fully recertified, 28 percent were provisionally recertified, and 6 percent were denied. In comparison, 86 percent of public schools were fully recertified, 14 percent were provisionally recertified, and fewer than 1 percent were denied. Nonprofit schools had rates similar to public schools, with 80 percent fully recertified, 18 percent provisionally recertified, and 2 percent denied (see fig 4). FSA staff from all four of our selected regional offices told us that they typically deny recertification when a school no longer meets eligibility requirements, such as losing accreditation, or when there is significant evidence of serious issues or massive wrongdoing, such as fraud. For example, managers in one regional office told us they denied recertification for a school because they had evidence that the school was accepting students without valid high school diplomas and referring them to diploma mills to boost enrollment. Staff in two FSA regional offices told us that they can also choose to fully recertify a school for shorter periods of time if they uncover issues related to administrative capability. For example, one regional staff member told us that when they found a school’s default rate for one federal student loan program had been high for the prior 3 years, the regional office decided to shorten the school’s full recertification period from 6 to 4 years, to allow FSA staff to review the school again sooner. FSA staff from all four of our selected regional offices told us that they provisionally certify schools for a variety of reasons, including when a school submits a late compliance audit or when a recent compliance audit indicates that a school could potentially have significant problems. Generally, schools in provisional certification status are subject to additional monitoring by FSA compared to schools that have been fully certified. For example, Education officials said that if they have concerns about a provisionally certified school’s student withdrawal rate, they can add provisional conditions requiring the school to submit monthly enrollment rosters for review. Staff in two FSA regional offices told us that in other cases, if they have concerns about how a school is administering federal student aid or suspected fraud, they can put a school on provisional status and conduct a program review to collect more detailed information on compliance with federal requirements. Education data also show that most schools remain in provisional status the first time they are recertified—62 percent from 2006 to 2017. In contrast, FSA staff fully recertified over three-quarters of schools that applied for recertification a second time during the same time period (see table 2). For more information on first and second recertification outcomes by school sector, see appendix II. We found that FSA generally relies on compliance audits as the only annual on-site review to determine how schools applying for recertification administer federal student aid. The audits provide direct information collected by independent auditors from school visits and file reviews examining how schools administer federal student aid and comply with program requirements. For example, OIG audit guidance directs auditors to check whether schools are distributing federal student aid to eligible students and accurately calculating student loan amounts. FSA officials and staff from all four of our selected regional offices said that compliance audits are a key source of information they use to assess a school’s administrative capability. Officials from Education’s OIG said that the quality of information in compliance audits varies substantially and depends on the auditor. The OIG has found quality problems in some of the compliance audits it selects—based on auditor and school risk factors—for its annual quality control reviews. Because the OIG selects higher risk audits to review, its reviews are more likely to detect problems, and OIG officials said they cannot make any conclusions about the overall prevalence of quality problems in compliance audits. However, our analysis of OIG quality review data found that of the 739 compliance audits reviewed by the OIG from fiscal years 2006 through 2017, the OIG passed 23 percent (173) and failed 59 percent (436). An additional 18 percent (130) passed with deficiencies. For example, across the 41 compliance audits it reviewed in fiscal year 2016, the OIG identified 264 quality deficiencies with the auditor’s work, according to our analysis of quality reviews provided by the OIG. The most frequently cited issues in these 41 audits were: reporting (24 audits), such as lack of evidence that the auditor tested whether the school correctly reported student enrollment status; student eligibility (20 audits), such as lack of evidence that the auditor verified student school attendance; and administrative capability (19 audits), such as lack of evidence that the auditor determined whether the accreditor had been notified about a change in school ownership within 10 days. FSA officials also identified quality issues with the compliance audits of some schools. FSA headquarters officials and staff we interviewed in several regional offices said they have seen schools with significant program review findings that had not been identified in annual compliance audits. FSA staff said they have referred some compliance audits to the OIG for quality reviews when they have had questions about the thoroughness of an audit. We also found a couple of examples in our review of school certification documents in which the findings identified in a school’s compliance audit were different from the findings identified by FSA in a program review of the same school covering the same time period. In one case, FSA staff said they probably would have fully recertified the school if they had relied solely on the compliance audit. Instead, they used the program review to determine that the school should be provisionally recertified. Compliance audits and program review findings are based on a sample of student records, and FSA staff said some differences in findings might be explained by differences in the records reviewed. FSA and OIG officials cited several issues that can affect the quality of compliance audits. FSA and OIG officials we interviewed said that some auditors conducting compliance audits have insufficient training in federal student aid, which contributes to audit quality problems. OIG staff also said that even if an auditor meets the general training hour requirements for auditors, the training content may not be relevant for federal student aid audits. In addition, FSA and OIG officials said some schools— particularly smaller schools—tend to hire less experienced auditors in order to save money, often resulting in poor quality audits. FSA officials in most selected regional offices said that additional training on federal student aid for auditors who are new to or unfamiliar with federal student aid could help improve audit quality. FSA and the OIG recently have taken steps to address audit quality and the information available to FSA staff when making certification decisions. These efforts include: Training for auditors: The OIG has taken steps to enhance training offered to auditors of schools’ administration of federal student aid and is exploring opportunities to provide additional training. In December 2017, the OIG and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants cosponsored training for auditors on the OIG’s 2016 revised guide for audits of for-profit schools, and other topics related to auditing federal student aid. The training included discussion of common audit quality issues and areas of highest risk. According to an OIG official, about 200 auditors attended, and after the event, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the OIG posted a recording of the training to their websites to make it available to additional auditors. In addition, OIG officials said they maintain an email account—listed on the OIG website—through which auditors can ask questions and receive responses. In March 2018, the OIG posted frequently asked questions and answers to the website. Timeliness of OIG quality reviews: Both FSA and OIG officials said that the OIG has recently renewed efforts to issue compliance audit quality reviews more quickly, after several years in which staffing shortages and other issues led to some delayed quality reviews. Guidance to schools on selecting an auditor: OIG officials said that at the 2017 FSA training conference for school financial aid staff, they presented to more than 400 participants about factors schools should consider when hiring an auditor. For example, they suggested that schools verify the licenses of certified public accountants, ask about the types of engagements an auditing firm has conducted, request and check references, check for any actions that may have been taken against a firm, and ask whether the auditor has been subject to a previous review by the OIG or another agency. FSA officials said they expected to invite the OIG to present at future FSA conferences, and OIG officials said they were seeking additional opportunities to share information on auditor selection with schools, including a planned presentation to an association of postsecondary schools. FSA working group: FSA recently established a working group to update its guidance to FSA staff on how to coordinate with the OIG to address compliance audits with quality problems. Among other topics, the working group has consulted with the OIG about how schools are made aware of the OIG’s findings regarding the quality of their audits. FSA officials said that OIG officials have provided input and feedback on FSA’s proposed changes to the guidance. Audit guide revisions: In addition, OIG and FSA staff told us they expected the OIG’s 2016 revisions to the for-profit school audit guide to improve the quality of compliance audits for those schools. They said that because the revised guide clarified some issues that were confusing to auditors in the previous guide issued in 2000, auditors might be better able to implement the guidance. The audit guide revisions include more testing and reporting requirements, clarified procedures, and guidance on issues such as fraud reporting and coordinating financial and compliance audits. The 2016 revisions first applied to audits for fiscal years beginning after June 30, 2016, and FSA began receiving those audits at the end of 2017. In addition, although the OIG’s 2016 revisions only apply to audits of for-profit schools, FSA officials said they planned to establish a working group to consider improvements to audit guidance for public and nonprofit schools. FSA and OIG efforts to address audit quality could help ensure that compliance audits provide accurate and reliable information on school administrative capability for Education’s recertification decisions.

Education is responsible for certifying that these schools are eligible for and capable of properly administering federal student aid funds. Schools are required to submit an annual compliance audit that provides information on schools' administrative capability, which Education considers in its school certification decisions. GAO was asked to review Education's process for certifying schools to receive federal student aid. This report examines (1) how Education certifies schools to administer federal student aid and how frequently schools are approved and denied certification; and (2) the role of compliance audits in the certification process and what, if any, steps Education has taken to address the quality of the audit information. GAO analyzed data on school certification outcomes for calendar years 2006-2017 (when GAO determined data were most reliable); reviewed data and reports summarizing Education's reviews of compliance audit quality for fiscal years 2006-2017; reviewed a non-generalizable sample of 21 school certification decisions from fiscal years 2015 and 2016, selected for a mix of decisions, school characteristics, and geographic regions; examined relevant federal laws, regulations, policy manuals and guidance; and interviewed Education officials. The Department of Education (Education) is responsible for evaluating a variety of information to determine whether a postsecondary school should be certified to administer federal student aid programs, and agency data show that it approves most schools that apply. Education procedures instruct regional office staff to review school policies, financial statements, and compliance audits prepared by independent auditors, among other things. Education can certify schools to participate in federal student aid programs for up to 6 years, or it can provisionally certify them for less time if it determines that increased oversight is needed—for example, when a school applies for certification for the first time or when it has met some but not all requirements to be fully certified. In calendar years 2006 through 2017, Education fully or provisionally approved most schools applying for initial or recertification to receive federal student aid (see figure). Note: Schools applying for certification for the first time and approved are placed in provisional certification. In deciding whether to certify schools, Education particularly relies on compliance audits for direct information about how well schools are administering federal student aid, and Education's offices of Federal Student Aid and Inspector General have taken steps to address audit quality. The Inspector General annually selects a sample of compliance audits for quality reviews based on risk factors, such as auditors previously cited for errors. In fiscal years 2006 through 2017, 59 percent of the 739 selected audits received failing scores. Audits that fail must be corrected; if not, the school generally must repay federal student aid covered by the audit. Because higher risk audits are selected for review, Inspector General officials said they cannot assess the overall prevalence of quality problems in compliance audits. These two Education offices have taken steps to improve audit quality. For example, the Inspector General offered additional training to auditors on its revised 2016 audit guide and provided guidance to schools on hiring an auditor, while Federal Student Aid created a working group to strengthen its procedures for addressing poor quality compliance audits. Education's efforts to address audit quality could help ensure that these audits provide reliable information for school certification decisions. GAO is not making recommendations in this report.""]","3366","gov_report","en","None","81e845f35acd55c1f6b4edda428a0a52fd22bade5be9cf13","Summary:","gov_report","532","\nThe report discusses the process of certification and recertification of postsecondary schools in the United States to participate in federal student aid programs. The certification process is overseen by the U.S. Department of Education's (Education) Federal Student Aid (FSA) office. To be certified, schools must be eligible, accredited, and authorized by the state in their respective state. Provisional certification is available for initial or first-time applicants, as well as schools that are not fully compliant with federal student aid requirements. Recertification can last from 1 to 6 years, with full recertification being more common.

"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nCybersecurity incidents continue to impact federal entities and the information they maintain. According to OMB’s 2018 annual FISMA report to Congress, agencies reported 35,277 information security incidents to DHS’s U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) in fiscal year 2017. As shown in figure 1, these incidents involved threat vectors, such as web-based attacks, phishing attacks, and the loss or theft of computer equipment, among others. These incidents and others like them can pose a serious challenge to economic, national, and personal privacy and security. The following examples highlight the impact of such incidents: In March 2018, the Department of Justice reported that it had indicted nine Iranians for conducting a massive cybersecurity theft campaign on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. According to the department, the Iranians allegedly stole more than 31 terabytes of documents and data from more than 140 American universities, 30 U.S. companies, and 5 federal government agencies, among other entities. In March 2018, a joint alert from DHS and the Federal Bureau of Investigation stated that, since at least March 2016, Russian government actors had targeted U.S. government entities and critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy, nuclear, water, aviation, and critical manufacturing sectors. In June 2015, the Office of Personnel Management reported that an intrusion into its systems had affected the personnel records of about 4.2 million current and former federal employees. Then, in July 2015, the agency reported that a separate but related incident had compromised its systems and the files related to background investigations for at least 21.5 million individuals. The federal approach and strategy for securing information systems is prescribed by federal law and policy. FISMA sets requirements for effectively securing federal systems and information. In addition, the Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015 requires protecting federal networks through the use of federal intrusion prevention and detection capabilities. Further, Executive Order 13800, Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure, directs agencies to manage cybersecurity risks to the federal enterprise by, among other things, using the NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (cybersecurity framework). FISMA was enacted to improve federal cybersecurity and clarify government-wide responsibilities. The law is intended to provide for improved oversight of federal agencies’ information security programs. Specifically, the law provides a comprehensive framework for ensuring the effectiveness of information security controls over information resources that support federal operations and assets. The law is also intended to ensure the effective oversight of information security risks, including those throughout civilian, national security, and law enforcement agencies. FISMA assigns OMB and DHS oversight roles in ensuring federal agencies’ compliance with the law. Among other things, FISMA requires OMB to develop and oversee the implementation of policies, principles, standards, and guidelines on information security in federal agencies, except with regard to national security systems. The law also assigns OMB the responsibility of requiring agencies to identify and provide information security protections commensurate with assessments of risk to their information and information systems. The law further requires DHS to administer the implementation of agency information security policies and practices for non-national security information systems, in consultation with OMB, by developing, issuing, and overseeing implementation of binding operational directives; monitoring agency implementation of information security policies and practices; and convening meetings with senior agency officials to help ensure their effective implementation of information security policies and practices, among other things. FISMA assigned to NIST the responsibility for developing standards and guidelines that include minimum information security requirements. To this end, NIST has issued several publications to provide guidance for agencies in implementing an information security program. For example, NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 provides guidance to agencies on the selection and implementation of information security and privacy controls for systems. FISMA also assigns to the head of each executive branch agency, responsibility for providing information security protections commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information systems used or operated by an agency or by a contractor of an agency or other organization on behalf of an agency. The law also delegates to the agency chief information officer (CIO), or comparable official, the authority to ensure compliance with FISMA requirements. The CIO is responsible for designating a senior agency information security officer whose primary duty is information security. In addition, the law requires agencies to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program to secure federal information systems. Specifically, these information security programs are to provide risk-based protections for the information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency. Further, FISMA requires agencies to comply with DHS binding operational directives, OMB policies and procedures, and NIST federal information processing standards. FISMA also has reporting requirements for OMB and federal agencies. Specifically, OMB is to report annually, in consultation with DHS, on the effectiveness of agency information security policies and practices, including a summary of major agency information security incidents and an assessment of agency compliance with NIST standards. Further, the law requires agencies to report annually to OMB, DHS, certain congressional committees, and the Comptroller General of the United States on the adequacy and effectiveness of their information security policies, procedures, and practices, as well as their compliance with FISMA. The Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015, among other things, sets forth authority for enhancing federal intrusion prevention and detection capabilities among federal entities. The act contains several provisions for DHS and OMB. Specifically, the act requires that DHS deploy, operate, and maintain capabilities to prevent and detect cybersecurity risks in network traffic traveling to or from an agency’s information system. DHS is to make these capabilities available for use by any agency. In addition, the act requires DHS to improve intrusion detection and prevention capabilities, as appropriate, by regularly deploying new technologies and modifying existing technologies. The act also requires OMB and DHS, in consultation with appropriate agencies, to review and update government-wide policies and programs to ensure appropriate prioritization and use of network security monitoring tools within agency networks, and to brief appropriate congressional committees. In May 2017, the President signed Executive Order 13800, which sets policy for managing cybersecurity risk as an executive branch enterprise. Specifically, it outlines actions to enhance cybersecurity across federal agencies and critical infrastructure to improve the nation’s cyber posture and capabilities against cybersecurity threats. To this end, the order states that the President will hold executive agency heads accountable for managing agency-wide cybersecurity risk and directs each executive agency to use the NIST cybersecurity framework to manage those risks. The cybersecurity framework, which provides guidance for cybersecurity activities, is based on five core security functions: Identify: Develop an organizational understanding to manage cybersecurity risk to systems, people, assets, data, and capabilities. Protect: Develop and implement appropriate safeguards to ensure delivery of critical services. Detect: Develop and implement appropriate activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event. Respond: Develop and implement appropriate activities to take action regarding a detected cybersecurity incident. Recover: Develop and implement appropriate activities to maintain plans for resilience and to restore capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity incident. According to NIST, these five functions should be performed concurrently and continuously to address cybersecurity risk. In addition, when considered together, they provide a high-level, strategic view of the life cycle of an organization’s management of cybersecurity risk. Within the five functions are 23 categories and 108 subcategories that include controls for achieving the intent of each function. Appendix II provides a description of the cybersecurity framework categories and subcategories of controls. In February 2013, we reported that the government had issued a variety of strategy-related documents that addressed priorities for enhancing cybersecurity within the federal government, as well as for encouraging improvements in the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure within the private sector. However, we noted that no overarching cybersecurity strategy had been developed that articulated priority actions, assigned responsibilities for performing them, and set time frames for their completion. Accordingly, we recommended that the White House Cybersecurity Coordinator in the Executive Office of the President develop an overarching federal cybersecurity strategy that included all key elements of the desirable characteristics of a national strategy. These characteristics would include, among other things, milestones and performance measures for major activities to address stated priorities; cost and resources needed to accomplish stated priorities; and specific roles and responsibilities of federal organizations related to the strategy’s stated priorities. Since that time, the executive branch has made progress toward outlining a federal strategy for confronting cyber threats. For example, in September 2018, we reported that recent executive branch initiatives that identify cybersecurity priorities for the federal government provide a good foundation toward establishing a more comprehensive strategy. Nevertheless, we pointed out that additional efforts were needed to address all of the desirable characteristics of a national strategy that we recommended. Specifically, recently issued executive branch strategy documents did not include key elements of desirable characteristics that can enhance the usefulness of a national strategy as guidance for decision makers in allocating resources, defining policies, and helping to ensure accountability. For example, these strategy documents did not generally include: milestones and performance measures to gauge results; resources needed to carry out the goals and objectives; and clearly defined roles and responsibilities for key agencies, such as DHS, the Department of Defense, and OMB. Ultimately, we determined that a more clearly defined, coordinated, and comprehensive approach to planning and executing an overall strategy would likely lead to significant progress in furthering strategic goals and lessening persistent weaknesses. Subsequent to our September 2018 report, the President issued the National Cyber Strategy on September 20, 2018. The strategy builds upon Executive Order 13800 and describes actions that federal agencies and the administration are to take to, among other things, secure federal information systems. For example, the strategy states that the administration is expected to further enable DHS to secure federal department and agency networks, to include ensuring that DHS has appropriate access to agency information systems for cybersecurity purposes and can take and direct action to safeguard systems. In addition, the strategy states that the administration plans to continue with its existing efforts underway to transition agencies to shared services and infrastructure and that DHS is to have appropriate visibility into those services and infrastructure to improve cybersecurity posture. DHS’s Network Security Deployment (NSD) division manages cybersecurity programs that are intended to improve the cybersecurity posture of the federal government. Among these programs, NCPS provides a capability to detect and prevent potentially malicious network traffic from entering agencies’ networks. In addition, the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program provides tools to agencies intended to identify and resolve cyber vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis. Operated by DHS’s US-CERT, NCPS is intended to detect and prevent cyber intrusions into agency networks, analyze network data for trends and anomalous data, and share information with agencies on cyber threats and incidents. Deployed in stages, this system, operationally known as EINSTEIN, has provided increasing capabilities to detect and prevent potential cyberattacks involving the network traffic entering or exiting the networks of participating federal agencies. Table 1 provides an overview of the EINSTEIN deployment stages to date. In January 2016, we reported the projected total life-cycle cost of the program was approximately $5.7 billion through fiscal year 2018. In addition, according to the Federal CIO, Congress appropriated $468 million in fiscal year 2017 and $402 million in fiscal year 2018 for NCPS. In that report, we also noted that NCPS was partially, but not fully, meeting most of its stated system objectives. Although the system’s intrusion detection capabilities provided the ability to detect known patterns of malicious activity on agency networks, it was limited in its capabilities to identify potential threats using anomaly-based detection. We also reported that although DHS had developed metrics for measuring the performance of NCPS, the metrics did not gauge the quality, accuracy, or effectiveness of the system’s intrusion detection and prevention capabilities. The department had also identified needs for future capabilities, but had not defined requirements for the capability to detect threats entering and exiting cloud service providers. Further, DHS had not considered specific vulnerability information for agency information systems in making risk- based decisions about future intrusion prevention capabilities. Accordingly, we made nine recommendations to DHS to, among other things, enhance the NCPS capabilities for meeting its objectives and better define requirements for future capabilities. DHS agreed with each of our nine recommendations and indicated that it would take steps to address them. DHS’s CDM program provides federal agencies with tools and services that have the intended capability to automate network monitoring, correlate and analyze security-related information, and enhance risk- based decision making at agency and government-wide levels. These tools include sensors that perform automated scans or searches for known cyber vulnerabilities, the results of which can feed into a dashboard that, at an agency level, is intended to alert network managers and enable the agency to allocate resources based on the risk. Summary data from each participating agency’s dashboard is expected to be transmitted to the Federal Dashboard where the data can be used to inform decisions about cybersecurity risks across the federal government. There are four phases of CDM implementation: Phase 1—involves deploying products to automate hardware and software asset management, configuration settings, and common vulnerability management capabilities. According to the Cybersecurity Strategy and Implementation Plan, DHS purchased phase 1 tools and integration services for all participating agencies in fiscal year 2015. DHS plans to have all phase 1 tools deployed at participating agencies by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2019. Phase 2—intends to address privilege management and infrastructure integrity by allowing agencies to monitor users on their networks and to detect whether users are engaging in unauthorized activity. According to the Cybersecurity Strategy and Implementation Plan, DHS was to provide agencies with additional phase 2 capabilities throughout fiscal year 2016, with the full suite of CDM phase 2 capabilities delivered by the end of that fiscal year. However, according to the OMB FISMA Annual Report to Congress for Fiscal Year 2017, the CDM program began deploying Phase 2 tools and sensors during fiscal year 2017. DHS plans to have all phase 2 tools deployed at participating agencies by the end of fiscal year 2019. Phase 3—includes detection capabilities that are intended to assess agency network activity and identify any anomalies that may indicate a cybersecurity compromise. Full operating capability for phases 1, 2, and 3 is planned to be achieved by the end of fiscal year 2022. Phase 4—intends to provide tools to (1) protect data at rest, in transit, and in use; (2) prevent loss of data; and (3) manage and mitigate data breaches. According to CDM program officials, phase 4 has not been approved and no tools have been selected. An approach for protecting systems against cybersecurity compromise is for federal agencies to build successive layers of defense mechanisms at strategic points in their information technology infrastructures. This approach, commonly referred to as defense in depth, entails implementing a series of protective mechanisms so that if one mechanism fails to detect and prevent an attack, another will provide a backup defense. By utilizing defense in depth, federal agencies can reduce the risk of a successful cyberattack by implementing intrusion detection and prevention capabilities. NIST has developed guidelines for protecting agency information systems using intrusion detection and prevention capabilities. For example, NIST SP 800-53 recommends that agencies strategically deploy capabilities and perform monitoring of their systems to include observation of events occurring on their network and at the external boundary of their network. In addition, NIST SP 800-94 provides agencies with guidance in designing, implementing, configuring, securing, monitoring, and maintaining such capabilities. As part of their defense-in-depth approach and, as recommended by the NIST guidelines, agencies can deploy the following list of capabilities, among others, on their networks to detect and prevent an attack: Protecting email from intrusions: According to OMB, email, by way of phishing attacks, remains one of the most common threat vectors across the government. Methods for protecting email include encryption, false email alerts, and anti-spear-phishing training. Monitoring cloud services: Cloud vendors provide services to agencies, including Software as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Infrastructure as a Service. As agencies increasingly rely on cloud services, monitoring traffic to and from their cloud service providers helps to ensure that agencies detect malicious traffic. Using host-based intrusion prevention: Host-based intrusion prevention systems provide defense at an individual system or device level by protecting against malicious activities. Host-based capabilities include memory-based protection and application whitelisting. Monitoring external and internal traffic: Agencies can monitor external and internal traffic, including: encrypted traffic, traffic between workstations and servers on the network, and direct connections to outside entities such as universities. Monitoring traffic helps to ensure that agencies detect malicious activity. Using security information and event management: A security information and event management capability produces real-time alerts and notifications of significant security events. Security alerts and notifications can provide the agency with better situational awareness regarding possible intrusion activity. According to inspectors general, agency CIOs, and OMB reports on federal information security practices, many agencies were not effectively implementing the federal government’s approach and strategy to securing information systems as of fiscal year 2017. Agencies’ inspectors general determined that most of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies did not have effective agency-wide information security programs. They also reported that agencies did not have effective information security controls in place, leading to deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting. In addition, the CIOs demonstrated that, during fiscal years 2016 and 2017, most agencies had not met all targets for the cybersecurity CAP goal for improving cybersecurity performance. Further, based on FISMA metrics reported for fiscal year 2017, OMB determined that 13 of the 23 agencies were managing risks to their enterprise, while the other 10 agencies were at risk of ineffectively identifying, protecting, detecting, responding to, and if necessary, recovering from cyber intrusions. Figure 2 summarizes agencies’ efforts to implement the government’s approach and strategy for securing information systems as of fiscal year 2017. Appendix III includes a table that provides an additional overview of the effectiveness of each agency’s implementation of the government’s approach and strategy to securing information systems. Inspectors general determined that more than half of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies did not have effective agency-wide information security programs as of fiscal year 2017. Further, in agency financial statement audit reports for fiscal year 2017, inspectors general reported that, despite improvements being made in information security practices, most of the civilian CFO Act agencies continued to exhibit deficiencies in information security controls. As a result of these deficiencies, inspectors general reported material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting. FISMA requires inspectors general to determine the effectiveness of their respective agencies’ information security programs. To do so, FISMA reporting instructions direct inspectors general to provide a maturity rating for agency information security policies, procedures, and practices related to the five core security functions established in the NIST cybersecurity framework, as well as for the agency-wide information security program. The ratings used to evaluate the effectiveness of agencies’ information security programs are based on a five-level maturity model, as described in table 2. According to this maturity model, Level 4 (managed and measurable) represents an effective level of security. Therefore, if an inspector general rates the agency’s information security program at Level 4 or Level 5, then that agency is considered to have an effective information security program. For fiscal year 2017, the inspectors general for 6 of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies reported that their agencies had an effective agency-wide information security program. More specifically, for the 5 core security functions, most inspectors general reported that their agency was at Level 3 (consistently implemented) for the identify, protect, and recover functions, and at Level 2 (defined) for the detect and respond functions, as shown in figure 3. Inspectors general report on the effectiveness of agencies’ information security controls as part of the annual audits of the agencies’ financial statements. The reports resulting from these audits include a description of information security control deficiencies related to the five major control categories defined by the Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual (FISCAM)—access controls, configuration management, segregation of duties, contingency planning, and security management. The reports also identify the inspectors general’s designation of information security as a significant deficiency or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting systems. For fiscal year 2017, inspectors general continued to identify information security control deficiencies in each of the five major control categories across the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies. The number of agencies with deficiencies in the access control and contingency planning information security control categories decreased between fiscal years 2016 and 2017, according to the inspectors general. Nevertheless, the inspectors general reported that agencies continued to exhibit deficiencies in these two control categories. In addition, the number of agencies with deficiencies in the security management and segregation of duties control categories increased from the prior year. The number of agencies reported as having deficiencies in the configuration management control category remained the same. Figure 4 shows the number of agencies that reported deficiencies in each of the information security control categories for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. Overall, inspectors general for the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies reported progress in agencies’ information security practices for fiscal year 2017. Specifically, during that time, 17 inspectors general designated information security as either a significant deficiency (11) or material weakness (6) in internal control over financial reporting systems for their agencies. This is a decrease from the previous fiscal year when 19 inspectors general designated information security as a significant deficiency (12) or material weakness (7). Reporting instructions contained in the fiscal year 2017 FISMA metrics directed CIOs to assess their agencies’ progress toward achieving outcomes that strengthen federal cybersecurity. To do this, CIOs evaluated their agencies’ performance in reaching targets for specific FISMA reporting metrics. According to the reporting instructions, certain metrics were selected to represent the administration’s cybersecurity CAP goal. These selected metrics allowed CIOs to evaluate their agencies progress in meeting targets for that goal. The cybersecurity CAP goal for fiscal years 2015 through 2017 was to improve cybersecurity performance by having an ongoing awareness of information security, vulnerabilities, and threats impacting the operating information environment; ensuring that only authorized users have access to resources and information; and implementing technologies and processes that reduce the risk of malware. The cybersecurity CAP goal consisted of three priority areas with a total of nine performance indicators. Each of the nine performance indicators had an expected level of performance, or target, for implementation. Table 3 shows the three priority areas and related performance indicators and targets of the cybersecurity CAP goal for fiscal years 2015 through 2017. According to agency CIO assessments for fiscal year 2017, 6 of the 23 agencies met all 9 targets for the cybersecurity CAP goal. More specifically, 8 agencies met all four targets for the information security continuous 16 agencies met the two targets for the identity, credential, and access management priority area; and 17 agencies met all three targets for the anti-phishing and malware defense priority area. In addition, CIOs reported that agencies were making progress in meeting the targets for the nine performance indicators for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, with increases in the number of agencies meeting the targets within each of the three priority areas. However, although the number of agencies that met the targets in individual priority areas showed a net increase, not all agencies maintained their status. For example, the CIO for one agency reported meeting all three targets for the anti-phishing and malware defense priority area in fiscal year 2016, but reported that the agency only met two of the three targets in fiscal year 2017. Figure 5 shows the number of agencies that reported meeting each of the targets within the individual cybersecurity CAP goal priority areas for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. Although the CIOs for only six agencies reported meeting each of the targets associated with all nine performance indicators for the three cybersecurity CAP goal priority areas, the CIOs at an additional eight agencies reported meeting each target for two of the three priority areas. Specifically, one CIO reported that its agency met each of the targets for the (1) information security continuous monitoring and (2) identity, credential, and access management priority areas; another CIO reported that its agency met each of the targets for the (1) information security continuous monitoring and (2) anti-phishing and malware defense priority areas; and the CIOs at six other agencies met each of the targets for the (1) identity, credential, and access management and (2) anti-phishing and malware defense priority areas. In fiscal year 2018, the President’s Management Agenda replaced the three cybersecurity-focused CAP goal priority areas with updated performance indicators, most of which are to be met by 2020: 1. the manage asset security priority area is similar to the information security continuous monitoring priority area from the previous CAP goal and has a focus on understanding the assets and users on agency networks. In addition to hardware asset and software asset management, this priority area includes performance indicators for authorization and mobile device management. 2. the limit personnel access priority area focuses on issues of access management. This area includes performance indicators for using automated access management and managing access for privileged network and high-impact system users. The privileged network access management performance indicator is a continuation of the identity, credential, and access management priority area of the previous cybersecurity CAP goal. Therefore, agencies are expected to complete this metric by the end of the fiscal year 2018 FISMA reporting year. 3. the protect networks and data priority area, which is similar to the anti-phishing and malware defense priority area from the previous cybersecurity CAP goal, has three new performance indicators: intrusion detection and prevention, exfiltration and enhanced defenses, and data protection. Appendix IV describes the updated cybersecurity-focused CAP priority areas and performance indicators in more detail. In Executive Order 13800, the President directed OMB, in coordination with DHS, to assess and report to the executive branch on the sufficiency and appropriateness of federal agencies’ processes for managing cybersecurity risks. For these risk management assessments, OMB leveraged the FISMA metrics reported by agency CIOs and inspectors general for fiscal year 2017. The metrics addressed domains that correspond with the five core security functions identified in the cybersecurity framework. Table 4 lists these domains and their relationship to the core functions. Based on OMB’s evaluation of these domains, agency risk management processes related to the five core security functions and overall agency enterprise fell into one of the following three rating categories: managing risk: required cybersecurity policies, procedures, and tools are in use and the agency actively manages cybersecurity risks; at risk: some essential policies, processes, and tools are in place to mitigate overall cybersecurity risk, but significant gaps remain; and high risk: key fundamental cybersecurity policies, processes, and tools are either not in place or not deployed sufficiently. For fiscal year 2017, OMB reported that not all agencies were managing risk. When considering each of the five core security functions, OMB reported that most of the 23 agencies were at risk or at high risk with regard to the identify and protect core security functions. Less than half of the 23 agencies were at risk with regard to the detect, respond, and recover core security functions. Overall, OMB determined that 13 agencies were managing risk and that the remaining 10 agencies were at risk of not effectively identifying, protecting, detecting, responding to, and if necessary, recovering from cyber intrusions. Figure 6 shows OMB’s risk management assessment ratings by core security function across the 23 agencies for fiscal year 2017. DHS and OMB, as required by law and policy, have taken various actions to facilitate the agencies’ use of intrusion detection and prevention capabilities to secure federal systems. For example, DHS has developed an intrusion assessment plan, deployed NCPS to offer intrusion detection and prevention capabilities to agencies, and is providing tools and services to agencies to monitor their networks through its CDM program. However, NCPS still had limitations in detecting certain types of traffic and agencies were not sending all appropriate traffic through the system. Further, CDM was behind at meeting planned implementation dates, and agencies have requested additional training and guidance for these services. OMB has taken steps to improve upon agencies’ capabilities, but has not completed a policy and strategy to do so, or fully reported on its assessment of agencies’ capabilities. The Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015 requires DHS, in coordination with OMB, to develop and implement an intrusion assessment plan to proactively detect, identify, and remove intruders in agency information systems on a routine basis. The act also requires that the plan be updated, as necessary. In December 2016, DHS documented its Intrusion Assessment Plan. In the plan, DHS outlined tools, platforms, resources, and ongoing work that the department provides, and that are intended to help agencies detect, identify, and remove intruders on their networks and systems. The intrusion assessment plan also outlines a defense-in-depth strategy, which utilizes multiple layers of cybersecurity and deploys multiple capabilities in combination, to secure agencies’ networks and information systems. For example, the plan calls for DHS to implement NCPS to provide a perimeter defense for the networks of federal civilian executive branch agencies, while the agencies are to deploy their own intrusion detection and prevention capabilities inside their networks. DHS submitted its intrusion assessment plan to OMB in January 2017. The Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015 also requires DHS to deploy, operate, and maintain a capability to detect cybersecurity risks and prevent network traffic associated with such risks from transiting to or from an agency information system. In addition, the act requires that DHS make regular improvements to intrusion detection and prevention capabilities by deploying new technologies and modifying existing technologies. Further, the act requires agencies to use this capability on all information traveling between their information systems and any information system other than an agency information system. DHS developed NCPS, operationally known as EINSTEIN, to provide the capabilities to detect and prevent potentially malicious network traffic from entering agency networks. Consistent with recommendations we made to DHS in January 2016, DHS has taken actions to improve these capabilities and has other actions underway. For example, the department determined that enhancing NCPS’s current intrusion detection approach to include functionality that would detect deviations from normal network behavior baselines would be feasible. In addition, according to DHS officials, the department was operationalizing functionality intended to identify malicious activity in network traffic otherwise missed by signature-based methods. determined that developing enhancements to current intrusion detection capabilities to facilitate the scanning of Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) traffic would be feasible. According to DHS officials, the department has developed plans to fully support IPv6 for several of its NCPS intrusion detection capabilities. Further, the department has developed implementation schedules and begun roll-out of the enhancements. updated the tool it uses to manage and deploy intrusion detection signatures to include a mechanism to clearly link signatures to publicly available, open-source information. developed clearly defined requirements for detecting threats on agency internal networks and at cloud service providers to help better ensure effective support of information security activities. According to DHS officials, the department was also continuing pilot activities with cloud service providers to enhance protections of agency assets. developed processes and procedures for using vulnerability information, such as data from the CDM program as it becomes available, to help ensure the department is using a risk-based approach for the selection/development of future NCPS intrusion prevention capabilities. Nevertheless, NCPS continues to have known limitations in its ability to identify potential threats. For example: NCPS does not have the ability to effectively detect intrusions across multiple types of traffic. Specifically, DHS determined that developing enhancements to current intrusion detection capabilities to facilitate the scanning of traffic related to supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) control systems would not be feasible. However, according to DHS officials, the department is exploring capabilities that are intended to provide critical, cross-sector, real-time visibility into critical infrastructure companies that utilize SCADA systems. In addition, DHS determined that the scanning of encrypted traffic would not be feasible. Nevertheless, according to its officials, the department performed research on potential architectural, technical, and policy mitigation strategies that could provide both the protection and situational awareness for encrypted traffic. The department has actions under way to continue its research in this area. DHS does not always explicitly ask agencies for feedback or confirmation of receipt of NCPS-related notification. While the department had drafted a standard operating procedure related to its incident notification process, the policy did not instruct DHS analysts specifically to include a solicitation of feedback from agencies within the notification. Further, US-CERT could not provide any information regarding the timetable for when these procedures would take effect. Metrics for NCPS, as provided by DHS, do not provide information about how well the system is enhancing government information security or the quality, efficiency and accuracy of supporting actions. Without the deployment of comprehensive measures, DHS cannot appropriately articulate the value provided by NCPS. While the department had taken actions to develop new measures, these measures did not provide a qualitative or quantitative assessment of the system’s ability to fulfill the system’s objectives. NSD did not provide guidance to agencies on how to securely route their information to their Internet service providers. Without providing network routing guidance, NSD has no assurance that the traffic it sees constitutes all or only a subset of the traffic the customer agencies intend to send. As shown in table 5, as of October 2018, the department had implemented five of the nine recommendations and was in the process of implementing the remainder. However, until DHS completes implementation of the remaining recommendations, the effectiveness of NCPS’s intrusion detection and prevention capabilities may be hindered. In addition, the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies had implemented NCPS capabilities to varying degrees. In a March 2018 report, OMB reported that 21 (about 91 percent) of the 23 agencies had implemented the first two iterations of the NCPS capabilities. In addition, 15 (about 65 percent) of the 23 agencies had implemented all three NCPS capabilities, as shown in table 6 below. However, agencies did not route all network traffic for all information traveling between their information systems and any information system other than an agency information system through NCPS sensors. For example, officials at 13 of 23 agencies stated that not all of their agency external network traffic flowed through NCPS. To illustrate, officials at one agency estimated that 20 percent of their external network traffic did not flow through the system. In addition, 4 of the agencies in our review previously cited several challenges in routing all of their traffic through NCPS intrusion detection sensors, including capacity limitations of the sensors, agreements with external business partners that use direct network connections, interagency network connections that do not route through Internet gateways, use of encrypted communications mechanisms, and backup network circuits that are not used regularly. NSD officials stated that agencies are responsible for routing their traffic to the intrusion detection sensors, and DHS does not have a role in that aspect of NCPS implementation. As a result, potential cyberattacks may not be detected or prevented for a portion of the external traffic at federal agencies. As noted above, we previously recommended that DHS work with agencies to better ensure the complete routing of information to NCPS sensors. The Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015 requires DHS to include, in the efforts of the department to continuously diagnose and mitigate cybersecurity risks, advanced network security tools to improve the visibility of network activity and to detect and mitigate intrusions and anomalous activity. According to DHS officials, the department is addressing the requirement to improve the visibility of network activity by including advanced network security tools as a part of CDM phase 3. In April 2018, we testified that DHS had previously planned to provide 97 percent of federal agencies with the services they needed for CDM phase 3 in fiscal year 2017. In addition, according to OMB’s annual FISMA report for fiscal year 2017, the CDM program was to continue to incorporate additional capabilities, including phase 3, in fiscal year 2018. However, DHS now expects initial operational capabilities to be in place for phase 3 in fiscal year 2019. The department has awarded contracts of approximately $3.26 billion to support its Dynamic and Evolving Federal Enterprise Network Defense (also known as DEFEND) aspect of the CDM program, which is to include phase 3. DEFEND also is to provide coverage for existing agency deployments. According to DHS documentation, the task orders associated with DEFEND are to be issued between the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 and the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. FISMA requires that DHS provide operational and technical assistance to agencies in implementing policies, principles, standards, and guidelines on information security. Toward this end, DHS has available training and guidance related to the implementation of the capabilities of NCPS (i.e., EINSTEIN) and CDM. Specifically: According the DHS officials, the department offers training and guidance to agencies on EINSTEIN 1 implementation. For example, DHS established a program in which the Software Engineering Institute will provide training and mentoring to agencies looking to enhance their understanding of, and proficiency with, the EINSTEIN 1 capability (e.g., network traffic information). NCPS program officials stated that agencies can use this service, which is available at no charge to them, on an unlimited basis as long as the requests relate to EINSTEIN 1. According to the officials, training and guidance related to EINSTEIN 2 and EINSTEIN 3 Accelerated is limited because DHS intentionally restricts the amount of data provided to agencies. According to DHS officials, the department also offers training and guidance to assist agencies with the implementation and use of resources associated with the CDM program, including webinars, guides, and computer-based training. The DEFEND contracts that the department awarded also include a mechanism for agencies to procure specialized tailored training, such as on the use of CDM tools. The department also offers customer advisory forums every other month that agencies are invited to attend. According to CDM program officials, the program’s governance, among other topics, is commonly discussed during these forums. Further, the department provides agencies with guidance, such as various governance documents, best practices, and frequently asked questions, through a web portal that is made available by OMB. In addition, US-CERT offers the CDM training program, which is to provide CDM implementation resources. Nevertheless, most agencies told us that they wanted DHS to provide more training and guidance as it relates to their implementation of the capabilities made available by NCPS and CDM. Specifically, Officials from 16 of 23 agencies reported that they wanted to receive additional training on NCPS capabilities. For example, officials at 5 agencies stated that they would like to receive training related to using network traffic information, understanding alerts, or implementing capabilities for cloud services. The officials also stated that they wanted training specific to agency security personnel. Officials from 19 of 23 agencies stated that they wanted to receive additional guidance related to NCPS’s capabilities, but not all of the 19 provided specific details. For example, officials from at least 3 agencies stated that they wanted additional guidance such as, “how to” documents, descriptions of architecture details, or guidance documents that explain NCPS’s capabilities so that agencies can gauge the gap between the security that the system provides and the security being provided by their own agency’s capabilities. Officials from 21 of 23 agencies reported that they wanted to receive additional training on implementing CDM at their agencies. For example, officials from 7 agencies suggested that additional training on the use of the tools would be beneficial. Officials from 22 of 23 agencies stated that they wanted additional guidance as it relates to CDM implementation. For example, officials from one agency stated that they would like examples of best practices and successful deployments. These requests for additional training and guidance demonstrate that agencies are either unaware of the available training and guidance, or that the training may not meet their needs. Until DHS coordinates with agencies to determine if additional training and guidance are needed, agencies may not be able to fully realize the benefits of the capabilities provided by the NCPS and CDM programs. Although OMB took steps to report on agencies’ implementation of intrusion detection and prevention capabilities, it did not report on all required actions. For example, the office did not submit DHS’s intrusion plan to Congress as required by the Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015. In addition, OMB provided various reports to Congress that described agencies’ intrusion detection and prevention capabilities, but the reports did not always include all information required by the act. Further, OMB developed a draft policy and strategy that were intended to improve agency capabilities, but it had not finalized these documents. The Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015 requires OMB to submit the intrusion assessment plan developed by DHS to the appropriate congressional committees no later than 6 months after the date of enactment of the act. The act also required OMB to submit to Congress a description of the implementation of the intrusion assessment plan and the findings of the intrusion assessments conducted pursuant to the intrusion assessment plan no later than 1 year after the date of enactment of the act, and annually thereafter. Although DHS developed and documented an intrusion assessment plan, which described a defense-in-depth approach to security, OMB did not submit the plan to Congress, as called for in the act. Even though DHS submitted the plan to OMB in January 2017, OMB had not submitted it to Congress as of October 2018 (21 months after DHS submitted the plan and 28 months past the due date). On the other hand, OMB did submit its own reports to Congress which generally described elements of the implementation of DHS’s intrusion assessment plan and intrusion assessment findings. In September 2017, OMB issued its analysis of agencies’ implementation of intrusion detection and prevention capabilities, or more specifically, agencies’ implementation of the various versions of NCPS. In addition, the office’s annual FISMA report, issued most recently in March 2018, generally covered elements of the intrusion assessment plan. OMB personnel within the Office of the Federal CIO believed that these two reports, along with a process the office had initiated to validate incidents across the government, addressed the requirement for OMB to submit to Congress a description of the implementation of the intrusion assessment plan and the findings of the intrusion assessments conducted pursuant to the plan. However, the September 2017 and March 2018 reports did not address other elements described in DHS’s intrusion assessment plan. For example, OMB did not describe agency roles associated with segmenting their networks, identifying key servers based on threat and impact, ensuring all applications are appropriately tracked and configured, and categorizing and tagging data based on threat and impact. While OMB has provided important information to congressional stakeholders through its own reports, until it submits the plan and addresses all elements described in DHS’s intrusion assessment plan, it will continue to be remiss in providing timely and sufficiently detailed information regarding the intrusion assessment plan to congressional stakeholders to support their oversight responsibilities. The Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015 also required that OMB submit an analysis of agencies’ application of the intrusion detection and prevention capabilities to Congress no later than 18 months after the date of enactment of the act, and annually thereafter. OMB was to include a list of federal agencies and the degree to which each agency had applied the intrusion detection and prevention capabilities in this analysis. As discussed previously in this report, OMB issued its analysis of agencies’ implementation of intrusion detection and prevention capabilities in September 2017. However, the analysis did not include the degree to which agencies had applied the intrusion detection and prevention capabilities. For example, the analysis did not reflect that not all agencies were using this capability on all information traveling between their systems and any system other than an agency system, as required by the act. Until OMB includes the degree to which agencies have applied intrusion detection and prevention capabilities in its analysis, it cannot provide congressional stakeholders with an accurate portrayal of the extent to which the capabilities are detecting and preventing potential intrusions. The Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015 further required that the Federal Chief Information Officer, within OMB, submit a report to Congress no earlier than 18 months after the date of enactment, but no later than 2 years after that date, assessing the intrusion detection and intrusion prevention capabilities that DHS made available to agencies. The act required that the report address (1) the effectiveness of DHS’s system used for detecting, disrupting, and preventing cyber-threat actors, including advanced persistent threats, from accessing agency information and agency information systems; (2) whether the intrusion detection and prevention capabilities, continuous diagnostics and mitigation, and other systems deployed are effective in securing federal information systems; (3) the costs and benefits of the intrusion detection and prevention capabilities, including as compared to commercial technologies and tools, and including the value of classified cyber threat indicators; and (4) the capability of agencies to protect sensitive cyber threat indicators and defensive measures if they were shared through unclassified mechanisms for use in commercial technologies and tools. In a report issued in September 2018 (about 8 months past the required due date), the Federal Chief Information Officer provided Congress an assessment of intrusion detection and intrusion prevention capabilities across the federal enterprise. The report pointed out, among other things, that agencies did not possess or properly deploy capabilities to detect or prevent intrusions or minimize the impact of intrusions when they occur. In addition, the report acknowledged the need to improve the effectiveness of intrusion detection and intrusion prevention capabilities and stated that OMB would track performance through the CAP goal and annual FISMA reports. However, the report did not address all of the requirements specified in the act. For example, the report did not address whether DHS’s system (i.e., NCPS) was effective in detecting advanced persistent threats. In addition, the report did not include a comparison of the costs and benefits of the intrusion detection and prevention capabilities versus commercial technologies and tools, or the value of classified cyber threat indicators. Further, the report did not address the capability of agencies to protect sensitive cyber threat indicators and defensive measures. Until OMB updates the Federal CIO report to address all of the requirements specified in the act, it will continue to be remiss in providing timely and sufficiently detailed information, such as that related to costs and benefits, among other elements in the act, to congressional stakeholders to support their oversight responsibilities. In addition to OMB’s responsibilities in the Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015, OMB has initiated plans for further improving agencies’ intrusion detection and prevention capabilities. In response to a tasking in Executive Order 13800, the Director of the American Technology Council coordinated the development of a report to the President from the Secretary of DHS, the Director of OMB, and the Administrator of the General Services Administration, regarding the modernization of federal information technology (IT). The report, Report to the President on Federal IT Modernization, identified actions that OMB should take for (1) prioritizing the modernization of high-risk, high-value assets and (2) modernizing the Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) program and NCPS to improve protections, remove barriers, and enable commercial cloud migration. For example, OMB was to take the following actions subsequent to the December 13, 2017 report issuance date: Within 60 days: Update a TIC policy to address challenges with agencies’ perimeter-based architectures, such as the modernization of NCPS. In addition, introduce a “90 day sprint” during which approved projects would pilot proposed changes in TIC requirements. Within 90 days: Update the annual FISMA and CAP goal metrics to focus on those critical capabilities that were most commonly lacking among agencies and focus oversight assessments on high-value assets. Within 120 days: In conjunction with DHS, develop a strategy for optimally realigning resources across agencies to reduce the risk to high-value assets and respond to cybersecurity incidents for those assets. OMB has taken steps toward implementing several, but not all, of these actions. For example, it introduced a “90 day sprint” and, according to knowledgeable OMB staff, the outcomes of this action are directly informing changes in TIC requirements. In addition, OMB updated the annual FISMA and CAP goal metrics by including several metrics that focus on high-value assets. The updated FISMA and CAP goal metrics went into effect in April 2018. However, while OMB had taken steps toward updating the TIC policy and developing a strategy for optimally realigning resources, the policy and strategy were in draft and had not yet been finalized as of October 2018. The agency did not specify a time frame for finalizing the policy and strategy. Until OMB finalizes the TIC policy and the strategy for optimally realigning resources, the enhancements offered through the policy and strategy are unlikely to be realized. FISMA requires agencies to provide information security protections to prevent unauthorized access to their systems and information. Officials from the 23 selected agencies reported to us that they generally took steps to meet this requirement by augmenting the tools and services provided by DHS with their own intrusion detection and prevention capabilities. However, agencies did not consistently implement five key capabilities specified by DHS and NIST guidance. In addition, most of the agencies did not fully implement any of the phases of DHS’s CDM program that is intended to improve their capabilities to detect and prevent intrusions. Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 18-01 instructs agencies to enhance email security. These enhancements include enabling encrypted email transmission, ensuring that receiving mail servers know what actions the agency would like taken when an email falsely claims to have originated from the agency, and removing certain insecure protocols, among others. The final deadline for implementing all BOD 18-01 requirements was October 16, 2018. Additionally, NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 recommends that security awareness training include training on how to recognize and prevent spear-phishing attempts. As of September 2018, only 2 of the 23 agencies reported implementing all of the email requirements. For the remaining 21 agencies: 9 agencies stated that their agency had plans to implement all enhancements by the October 2018 deadline, 1 agency was uncertain whether it would meet the deadline, and 11 stated they would not be able to meet the deadline. By contrast, the majority of agencies (22 of 23) reported that they had trained staff on spear-phishing exercises, as recommended by NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4. Officials at the remaining agency told us that the agency planned to have spear-phishing exercises in fiscal year 2019. Such training should help ensure that phishing will be a less effective attack vector against the majority of agencies. While agencies benefit from secure protocols and spear-phishing training, implementing the remaining BOD 18-01 email requirements would provide additional protection to agency information systems. NIST recommends that federal agencies deploy intrusion detection and prevention capabilities. These capabilities include monitoring cloud services, using host-based intrusion prevention systems, monitoring external and internal network traffic, and using a security information and event management (SIEM) system. However, in our semi-structured interviews of the 23 agencies, officials told us that they often had not implemented many of these capabilities. Such inconsistent implementation exposes federal systems and the information they contain to additional risk. As part of their continuing oversight efforts, OMB and DHS can use the information below to work with agencies to identify obstacles and impediments affecting the agencies’ abilities to implement these capabilities. NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 states that agencies should monitor and control communications at the external boundary of the network. However, as of June 2018, fewer than half of the agencies that used cloud computing services were monitoring cloud traffic. Specifically: 10 of 22 agencies that used Infrastructure as a Service were monitoring inbound and outbound Infrastructure as a Service traffic, 7 of 21 agencies that used Platform as a Service were monitoring inbound and outbound Platform as a Service traffic, and 10 of 23 agencies that used Software as a Service were monitoring inbound and outbound Software as a Service traffic. Without monitoring traffic to and from cloud service providers, agencies risk a greater chance of malicious cloud activity detrimentally affecting agency information security. NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 states that agency internal monitoring may be achieved by utilizing intrusion prevention capabilities. These capabilities include using host-based intrusion prevention systems to provide defense at an individual system or device level by protecting against malicious activities. Host-based capabilities include memory-based protection and application whitelisting. As of June 2018, officials at the 23 agencies reported the following to us: 16 agencies used host-based intrusion prevention capabilities, 15 agencies used memory-based protection, and 8 agencies used host-based application whitelisting. Until host-based intrusion protections are fully deployed, agencies will be at greater risk of malicious activity adversely affecting agency operations. NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 also states that agencies should monitor and control communications at the external boundary of the network and at key internal boundaries (e.g., network traffic). NIST guidance also stated that an agency should deploy monitoring devices strategically within the network to detect essential information. However, the agencies in our review did not always monitor external and internal traffic. For example, of the 23 agencies: 5 reported that they were not monitoring inbound or outbound direct connections to outside entities. 11 reported that they were not persistently monitoring inbound encrypted traffic. 8 reported that they were not persistently monitoring outbound encrypted traffic. In addition, 13 agencies reported they were not using a network-based session capture solution. Of the 10 agencies that reported using this solution, officials from 2 agencies stated that they were not capturing workstation-to-workstation connections. Without thorough monitoring of external and internal traffic, agencies will have less assurance that they are aware of compromised or potentially compromised traffic within their network. NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 states that agencies should establish enhanced monitoring capabilities. Such capabilities should include automated mechanisms that collect and analyze incident data for increased threat and situational awareness. According to NIST, a security information and event management (SIEM) system analyzes data from different sources and identifies and prioritizes significant events. Sources of data used by SIEM systems include logs from database systems, network devices, security systems, web applications, and workstation operating systems. Of the 23 agencies that we reviewed, 21 reported using a SIEM capability. Over half of the agencies employing a SIEM used one or more of their logs to match against known vulnerabilities and advanced persistent threats, as well as to create real-time alerts. For example, of the 21 agencies: 14 agencies reported collecting database logs, but only 7 agencies reported using the logs to match against known vulnerabilities and persistent threats and to create real-time alerts; 20 agencies reported collecting network logs, but only 13 agencies reported using them to match against known vulnerabilities and persistent threats and to create real-time alerts; 21 agencies reported collecting security logs, but only 13 reported using them to match against known vulnerabilities and persistent threats and to create real-time alerts; 15 agencies reported collecting web application logs, but only 9 agencies reported using them to match against known vulnerabilities and persistent threats and to create real-time alerts; and 13 agencies reported collecting workstation logs, but only 8 agencies reported using them to match against known vulnerabilities and persistent threats and to create real-time alerts. Only 5 agencies collected all 5 types of logs and used them to match against known vulnerabilities and persistent threats and to create real- time alerts. By not fully using SIEM capabilities, agencies will have less assurance that relevant personnel will be aware of possible weaknesses or intrusions. To further enhance their intrusion detection and prevention capabilities, the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies were in the process of implementing DHS’s CDM program. As previously discussed, Phase 1 of the program involves deploying products to automate hardware and software asset management, configuration settings, and common vulnerability management capabilities. Phase 2 intends to address privilege management and infrastructure integrity by allowing agencies to monitor users on their networks and to detect whether users are engaging in unauthorized activity. Phase 3 is intended to assess agency network activity and identify any anomalies that may indicate a cybersecurity compromise. As of June 2018, most agencies had not fully implemented any of the three phases. As shown in Figure 7, 15 agencies had partially implemented phase 1, 21 had partially or not yet begun to implement phase 2, and none of the agencies had fully implemented phase 3. Agencies’ implementation status has been affected, at least in part, due to delays in DHS’s deployment of the program phases. As a result, federal systems will remain at risk until the program is fully deployed. Many agencies have not effectively implemented the federal approach and strategy for securing information systems. For example, the inspectors general for 17 of the 23 selected agencies reported that their agencies had not effectively implemented their information security programs and had significant information security deficiencies associated with internal control over financial reporting. In addition, CIOs for 17 agencies reported not meeting all nine targets for the cybersecurity cross- agency priority goal. Further, OMB determined that that only 13 of the 23 agencies were managing risks to their overall enterprise, while the other 10 agencies were at risk. Until agencies more effectively implement the government’s approach and strategy, federal systems will remain at risk. DHS and OMB have initiatives underway that are intended to further improve agencies’ security posture. However, although DHS had provided training and guidance for NCPS and CDM, agencies expressed the need for more. In addition, OMB had also not finalized its policy and strategy aimed at addressing challenges with perimeter security and protecting high value assets, respectively. OMB had also not provided useful information to Congress, such as a description of agencies’ implementation of DHS’s intrusion assessment plan, the degree to which agencies are using NCPS, a complete analysis of agencies’ implementation of DHS’s intrusion assessment plan, or the costs and benefits of using commercial tools. Although agencies’ officials reported various efforts underway to enhance their agency’s intrusion detection and prevention capabilities, implementation efforts across the federal government were not consistent. OMB and DHS can use the information provided in this report to work with agencies to identify obstacles and impediments affecting the agencies’ abilities to implement these capabilities. We are making a total of nine recommendations, including two to DHS and seven to OMB. Specifically: The Secretary of DHS should direct the Network Security Deployment division to coordinate further with federal agencies to identify training and guidance needs for implementing NCPS and CDM. (Recommendation 1) The Secretary of DHS should direct the appropriate staff to work with OMB to follow up with agencies to identify obstacles and impediments affecting their abilities to implement intrusion detection and prevention capabilities. (Recommendation 2) The Director of OMB should submit the intrusion assessment plan to the appropriate congressional committees. (Recommendation 3) The Director of OMB should report on implementation of the defense- in-depth strategy described in the intrusion assessment plan, including all elements described in the plan. (Recommendation 4) The Director of OMB should update the analysis of agencies’ intrusion detection and prevention capabilities to include the degree to which agencies are using NCPS. (Recommendation 5) The Director of OMB should direct the Federal CIO to update her report to Congress to include required information, such as detecting advanced persistent threats, a comparison of the costs and benefits of the capabilities versus commercial technologies and tools, and the capability of agencies to protect sensitive cyber threat indicators and defense measures. (Recommendation 6) The Director of OMB should establish a time frame for finalizing the Trusted Internet Connections policy intended to address challenges with agencies’ perimeter-based architectures and issue it when finalized. (Recommendation 7) The Director of OMB should establish a time frame for finalizing the strategy for realigning resources across agencies to protect high- value assets and issue it when finalized. (Recommendation 8) The Director of OMB should direct the Federal CIO to work with DHS to follow-up with agencies to identify obstacles and impediments affecting their abilities to implement intrusion detection and prevention capabilities. (Recommendation 9) We provided a draft of this report to OMB and the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies, including DHS, covered by our review. In response, OMB provided comments via email, and DHS and three other agencies (the Department of Commerce, Social Security Administration, and U.S. Agency for International Development) provided written comments, which are reprinted in appendices V through VIII, respectively. The 19 remaining agencies (the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, the Interior, Justice, Labor, State, Transportation, the Treasury, and Veterans Affairs; as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, General Services Administration, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Science Foundation, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Office of Personnel Management, and Small Business Administration) stated via email that they had no comments. In its comments, which the OMB liaison provided to GAO via email on December 7, 2018, OMB did not state whether it agreed or disagreed with the seven recommendations that we made to it. Rather, according to the liaison, OMB agreed with the facts in our draft report, but found that the report did not reflect the agency’s rationale for not submitting the DHS intrusion assessment plan to Congress and a report on the implementation of the plan, as required by the Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015. The liaison stated that OMB is working closely with DHS to provide strategic direction in assessing gaps in, and modernizing, the manner in which intrusion detection and prevention capabilities are delivered to the federal government. Further, in a subsequent email on December 10, 2018, OMB said it believes the Federal CIO’s September 2018 report to Congress, along with data provided in OMB’s fiscal year 2017 FISMA report to Congress, achieves the outcomes sought by the Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015 and demonstrates OMB's continuous engagement with DHS across the evolution of the intrusion detection and prevention program. As stated in our report, we acknowledge that OMB has provided important information to congressional stakeholders through its reports. However, OMB’s reports did not cover all outcomes described in the act. For example, as we pointed out, these reports did not fully address implementation of the defense-in-depth strategy described in DHS’s intrusion assessment plan. In addition, although OMB reported on several elements required by the Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015, it did not report on all of the required elements. For example, the reports did not address whether DHS’s NCPS was effective in detecting advanced persistent threats. The reports also did not include a comparison of the costs and benefits of the intrusion detection and prevention capabilities versus commercial technologies and tools, or the value of classified cyber threat indicators. Further, the reports did not address the capability of agencies to protect sensitive cyber threat indicators and defensive measures. Accordingly, we maintain that our recommendations for OMB to report on required elements in the Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015 are warranted. In addition, OMB suggested that we revise our recommendations to the agency to include a shared responsibility with DHS to help drive desired outcomes. However, six of the seven recommendations we are making to OMB are related to specific OMB responsibilities cited in either the Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015 or the Report to the President on Federal IT Modernization. As such, we believe the recommendations are appropriately addressed to OMB. Furthermore, our recommendations do not prevent OMB from working with DHS to implement them. Our seventh recommendation to OMB—to work with DHS to follow up with agencies to identify obstacles and impediments affecting their abilities to implement intrusion detection and prevention capabilities—includes a shared responsibility with DHS. OMB also provided technical comments, which we incorporated into the report, as appropriate. Subsequent to providing initial comments on our draft report, OMB issued a memorandum intended to provide a strategy for realigning resources across agencies to protect high-value assets. This action addresses our recommendation 8, which called for the Director of OMB to establish a time frame for finalizing the strategy for realigning resources across agencies to protect high-value assets, and to issue the strategy when finalized. In its comments, DHS stated that it concurred with the two recommendations we made to the department. DHS stated that it expects to implement the recommendations in 2019. The Department of Commerce commented that the report was reasonable and that the department agreed with the findings and recommendations. In its comments, the Social Security Administration stated that protecting its networks and information is a critical priority. According to the agency, it continued to make improvements in fiscal year 2018, such as improvements and progress in securing applications, leveraging the cloud, managing its assets and vulnerabilities, strengthening its network and incident response capabilities, improving its security training, and enhancing the overall effectiveness of its cybersecurity program. Finally, the U.S. Agency for International Development commented that its inspector general had improved the agency’s capability maturity ratings for core security functions in fiscal year 2018. The agency also pointed out that it was the only selected agency in which fiscal year 2017 indicators of effectiveness in implementing the federal approach and strategy for securing information systems were all positive (as noted in Appendix III). We are sending copies of this report to appropriate congressional committees, the Director of OMB, the heads of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies and their inspectors general, and other interested congressional parties. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact Gregory C. Wilshusen at (202) 512-6244 or wilshuseng@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix IX. The Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015, which was enacted December 18, 2015, included a provision for GAO to report on the effectiveness of the federal government’s approach and strategy for securing agency information systems, including intrusion detection and prevention capabilities. The objectives of our review were to assess: (1) the reported effectiveness of selected agencies’ implementation of the federal government’s approach and strategy to securing agency information systems; (2) the extent to which the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have facilitated the use of intrusion detection and prevention capabilities to secure federal agency information systems; and (3) the extent to which selected agencies reported implementing intrusion detection and prevention capabilities. Selected agencies for our review were the 23 civilian agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act). We did not include the Department of Defense because the Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015 only pertains to civilian agencies. Because we focused our work on the 23 civilian agencies, results from these reviews are not generalizable to the entire federal government. To assess the reported effectiveness of agencies’ implementation of the federal government’s approach and strategy to securing agency information systems, we described the federal government’s approach and strategy by summarizing the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA), Executive Order 13800, Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (cybersecurity framework). assessed the reported effectiveness of agencies’ implementation of the approach and strategy by reviewing annual reports from OMB and the inspectors general (IG) of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies regarding the reported implementation of FISMA for fiscal year 2017. We described the IG reported maturity levels, including the Office of Inspectors General FISMA Reporting Metrics definition of “effectiveness.” These maturity levels are based on security domains aligned with the five core functions in NIST’s cybersecurity framework. We also summarized IG reported conclusions on the effectiveness of agencies’ information security programs for fiscal year 2017. reviewed the fiscal year 2016 and 2017 financial statement audit reports for each of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies to identify the extent to which any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses related to information security over financial systems had been reported and to identify information security control weaknesses reported by the IGs. identified whether agencies had met the targets for the cybersecurity- focused cross-agency priority goal for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 by examining agency-reported performance metrics for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. evaluated OMB’s agency risk management assessment ratings to make a determination on how agencies were managing risk to their enterprise. These conclusions were based on FISMA metrics, and are aligned with the five core security functions defined in the cybersecurity framework. interviewed knowledgeable OMB officials and staff to obtain their views on the reported effectiveness of the federal government’s approach and strategy to securing agency information systems. To assess the extent to which OMB and DHS have facilitated the use of intrusion detection and prevention capabilities to secure federal agency information systems, we determined the extent OMB and DHS fulfilled their requirements described in the Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015 by collecting and reviewing artifacts from OMB and DHS and comparing them to the provisions outlined in the act. We also interviewed knowledgeable officials from OMB and DHS regarding their efforts to fulfill their requirements described in the act. determined the effectiveness of corrective actions taken by DHS to address nine previously reported recommendations we made in our report related to NCPS. Specifically, we collected appropriate artifacts and assessed the artifacts against the criteria used in that report, and determined the extent to which the actions taken by DHS met the intent of the recommendations, and we met with DHS staff responsible for the remediation activities and obtained their views of the status of actions taken to address the recommendations. held semi-structured interviews with knowledgeable officials from the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies. During these interviews, we obtained the agency’s views on whether they need more training and guidance from DHS for NCPS and CDM. We also interviewed knowledgeable officials and staff at DHS to obtain their views on how DHS had improved the intrusion detection and prevention capabilities it provides to federal agencies. We also interviewed DHS officials to obtain their views on the training and guidance that the department makes available to agencies. To assess the extent to which selected agencies reported implementing intrusion detection and prevention capabilities, we described the reported intrusion detection and prevention capabilities implemented by the 23 civilian CFO Act civilian agencies by summarizing implemented intrusion detection and prevention capability information obtained from the semi-structured interviews at the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies described above; identifying the extent to which the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies were in compliance with DHS’s binding operating directive (BOD) pertaining to enhanced email and web security (BOD 18-01) by collecting and summarizing Cyber Hygiene Trustworthy Email reports from the 23 agencies and determining the extent to which the agencies had taken required actions to implement the BOD. During the semi-structured interviews, we also obtained the agency’s views and experiences with other programs and services provided by DHS, including the extent to which agencies had implemented the tools offered by the department’s Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program. To determine the reliability of submitted data and obtain clarification about agencies’ processes to ensure the accuracy and completeness of data used in their respective FISMA reports, we analyzed documents and conducted interviews with officials from 6 of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies. To select these six agencies, we sorted agency fiscal year 2017 information technology budget data from highest to lowest amount and then divided the data into three tiers: high spending, medium spending, and low spending. We then randomly selected two agencies from each of the three tiers. The selected agencies were the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Veterans Affairs, and the U.S. Agency for International Development. While not generalizable to all agencies, the information we collected and analyzed about the six selected agencies provided insights into various processes in place to produce FISMA reports. Based on this assessment, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives. We conducted this performance audit from December 2017 to December 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. The National Institute of Standards and Technology established the cybersecurity framework to provide guidance for cybersecurity activities within the private sector and government agencies at all levels. The cybersecurity framework consists of five core functions: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. Within the five functions are 23 categories and 108 subcategories that define discrete outcomes for each function, as described in table 7. The federal approach and strategy for securing information systems is prescribed by federal law and policy, including the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 and the presidential executive order on Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure. Accordingly, federal reports describing agency implementation of this law and policy, and reports of related agency information security activities, indicated the effectiveness of agencies’ efforts to implement the federal approach and strategy. Table 8 summarizes the reported effectiveness of the 23 civilian Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 agencies to implement the government’s approach and strategy to securing information systems. The President’s Management Agenda identifies cross-agency priority (CAP) goals to target areas where multiple agencies must collaborate to effect change. The agenda issued in fiscal year 2018 established an information technology modernization goal that includes a cybersecurity objective with specific priority areas and performance indicators. This cybersecurity-focused goal is intended to drive progress in the government’s efforts to modernize information technology to increase productivity and security. Figure 8 describes the 3 updated cybersecurity- focused cross-agency priority areas and 10 performance indicators. Each federal agency is expected to meet one of the 10 new performance indicators by the end of fiscal year 2018 and the remainder by 2020. In addition to the individual named above, Jeffrey Knott (assistant director), Daniel Swartz (analyst-in-charge), David Blanding, Chris Businsky, Kristi Dorsey, Di’Mond Spencer, Priscilla Smith, and Edward Varty made key contributions to this report. West Coile, Franklin Jackson, and Chris Warweg also provided assistance.\n\n","[""Federal agencies are dependent on information systems to carry out operations. The risks to these systems are increasing as security threats evolve and become more sophisticated. To reduce the risk of a successful cyberattack, agencies can deploy intrusion detection and prevention capabilities on their networks and systems. GAO first designated federal information security as a government-wide high-risk area in 1997. In 2015, GAO expanded this area to include protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information. Most recently, in September 2018, GAO updated the area to identify 10 critical actions that the federal government and other entities need to take to address major cybersecurity challenges. The federal approach and strategy for securing information systems is grounded in the provisions of the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 and Executive Order 13800. The act requires agencies to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide program to secure their information systems. The Executive Order, issued in May 2017, directs agencies to use the National Institute of Standards and Technology's cybersecurity framework to manage cybersecurity risks. The Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2015 contained a provision for GAO to report on the effectiveness of the government's approach and strategy for securing its systems. GAO determined (1) the reported effectiveness of agencies' implementation of the government's approach and strategy; (2) the extent to which DHS and OMB have taken steps to facilitate the use of intrusion detection and prevention capabilities to secure federal systems; and (3) the extent to which agencies reported implementing capabilities to detect and prevent intrusions. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed OMB reports related to agencies' information security practices including OMB's annual report to Congress for fiscal year 2017. GAO also analyzed and summarized agency-reported security performance metrics and IG-reported information for the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies. In addition, GAO evaluated plans, reports, and other documents related to DHS intrusion detection and prevention programs, and interviewed OMB, DHS, and agency officials. The 23 civilian agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act) have often not effectively implemented the federal government's approach and strategy for securing information systems (see figure below). Until agencies more effectively implement the government's approach and strategy, federal systems will remain at risk. To illustrate: As required by Office of Management and Budget (OMB), inspectors general (IGs) evaluated the maturity of their agencies' information security programs using performance measures associated with the five core security functions—identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. The IGs at 17 of the 23 agencies reported that their agencies' programs were not effectively implemented. IGs also evaluated information security controls as part of the annual audit of their agencies' financial statements, identifying material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal controls for financial reporting at 17 of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies. Chief information officers (CIOs) for 17 of the 23 agencies reported not meeting all elements of the government's cybersecurity cross-agency priority goal. The goal was intended to improve cybersecurity performance through, among other things, maintaining ongoing awareness of information security, vulnerabilities, and threats; and implementing technologies and processes that reduce malware risk. Executive Order 13800 directed OMB, in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), to assess and report on the sufficiency and appropriateness of federal agencies' processes for managing cybersecurity risks. Using performance measures for each of the five core security functions, OMB determined that 13 of the 23 agencies were managing overall enterprise risks, while the other 10 agencies were at risk. In assessing agency risk by core security function, OMB identified a few agencies to be at high risk (see figure at the top of next page). DHS and OMB facilitated the use of intrusion detection and prevention capabilities to secure federal agency systems, but further efforts remain. For example, in response to prior GAO recommendations, DHS had improved the capabilities of the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS), which is intended to detect and prevent malicious traffic from entering agencies' computer networks. However, the system still had limitations, such as not having the capability to scan encrypted traffic. The department was also in the process of enhancing the capabilities of federal agencies to automate network monitoring for malicious activity through its Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program. However, the program was running behind schedule and officials at most agencies indicated the need for additional training and guidance. Further, the Federal CIO issued a mandated report assessing agencies' intrusion detection and prevention capabilities, but the report did not address required information, such as the capability of NCPS to detect advanced persistent threats, and a cost/benefit comparison of capabilities to commercial technologies and tools. Selected agencies had not consistently implemented capabilities to detect and prevent intrusions into their computer networks. Specifically, the agencies told GAO that they had not fully implemented required actions for protecting email, cloud services, host-based systems, and network traffic from malicious activity. For example, 21 of 23 agencies had not, as of September 2018, sufficiently enhanced email protection through implementation of DHS' directive on enhanced email security. In addition, less than half of the agencies that use cloud services reported monitoring these services. Further, most of the selected 23 agencies had not fully implemented the tools and services available through the first two phases of DHS's CDM program. Until agencies more thoroughly implement capabilities to detect and prevent intrusions, federal systems and the information they process will be vulnerable to malicious threats. GAO is making two recommendations to DHS, to among other things, coordinate with agencies to identify additional needs for training and guidance. GAO is also making seven recommendations to OMB to, among other things, direct the Federal CIO to update the mandated report with required information, such as detecting advanced persistent threats. DHS concurred with GAO's recommendations. OMB did not indicate whether it concurred with the recommendations or not.""]","12551","gov_report","en","None","a6d311b6722cdf0fd1e95f07371162c59183a53db1fc5f62","Summary:","gov_report","532","\n\nThe report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAOIG (GAO) reveals that the federal government's 23 civilian civilian agencies have not effectively implemented the five cybersecurity C"

Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nSince 1993, USAID has obligated more than $5 billion in bilateral assistance to the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, primarily using funds appropriated through the ESF. According to State officials, through the ESF, USAID provides project assistance and debt relief payments to PA creditors. USAID, with overall foreign policy guidance from State, implements most ESF programs, including programs related to private sector development, health, water and road infrastructure, local governance, civil society, rule of law, education, and youth development. According to USAID officials, this assistance to the West Bank and Gaza contributes to building a more democratic, stable, prosperous, and secure Palestinian society—a goal that USAID described as being in the interest of the Palestinians, the United States, and Israel. Figure 1 shows the location of the West Bank and Gaza relative to surrounding countries. USAID assistance to the West Bank and Gaza is conducted under antiterrorism policies and procedures outlined in an administrative policy document known as Mission Order 21. The stated purpose of the mission order, as amended, is to describe policies and procedures to ensure that the mission’s program assistance does not inadvertently provide support to entities or individuals associated with terrorism. We have previously reported on the status of ESF assistance to the Palestinians and USAID’s antiterrorism policies and procedures in the West Bank and Gaza. As of March 31, 2018, USAID had obligated about $544.1 million (over 99 percent) and expended about $350.6 million (over 64 percent) of approximately $544.5 million in ESF assistance allocated for the West Bank and Gaza in fiscal years 2015 and 2016 (see table 1). USAID obligated portions of the allocated funds for direct payments to PA creditors—specifically, payments to two Israeli fuel companies, to cover debts for petroleum purchases, and to a local Palestinian bank, to pay off a line of credit used for PA medical referrals to six hospitals in the East Jerusalem Hospital network. Project assistance obligated for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 accounted for about $215 million (74 percent) and $184 million (72 percent), respectively, of USAID’s obligations of ESF assistance for the West Bank and Gaza for those fiscal years (see fig. 1). Payments to the PA’s creditors accounted for the remaining obligations—about $75 million (26 percent) of fiscal year 2015 obligations and about $70 million (28 percent) of fiscal year 2016 obligations. According to USAID documents, ESF project assistance for the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 was obligated for three USAID development objectives: Economic Growth and Infrastructure (about $239 million), Investing in the Next Generation (about $107 million), and Governance and Civic Engagement (about $25 million). Program support—which sustains all development objectives, according to USAID—accounted for about $29 million (see table 2). Economic Growth and Infrastructure. The largest share—about 60 percent—of USAID’s ESF project assistance for the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 supported the agency’s Economic Growth and Infrastructure development objective. According to USAID documents, as of March 31, 2018, the agency had obligated about $239 million and expended approximately $89 million (about 37 percent) for projects under this objective. USAID officials stated that the agency funded these projects under the following standard State-budgeted program areas: health (including water), infrastructure, private sector competiveness, and stabilization operations and security sector reform. The largest project—the Architecture and Engineering Services project—received about $20 million of fiscal year 2015 ESF assistance and $17 million of fiscal year 2016 ESF assistance. The purpose of the project was to rehabilitate and construct infrastructure through the procurement of infrastructure services, including engineering design and construction management, among other things. The contractor was required to coordinate with relevant PA and Israeli entities, as well as with USAID, to assist in the selection of PA water and wastewater projects and in the planning and design of water projects such as small- to large-scale water distribution systems, water treatment systems, and institutional capacity building. Investing in the Next Generation. The second-largest share—about 27 percent—of USAID’s fiscal years 2015 and 2016 ESF project assistance for the West Bank and Gaza supported the agency’s Investing in the Next Generation development objective. According to USAID documents, as of March 31, 2018, the agency had obligated about $107 million and expended approximately $79 million (about 74 percent) for projects under this objective. Program areas funded included education, health, social and economic services and protection of vulnerable populations. The largest project funded under this objective—a grant to the World Food Program for assistance to vulnerable groups—received $12 million in fiscal year 2015 and $15 million in fiscal year 2016 ESF assistance. The project focused on ensuring food security, including meeting food needs, of the nonrefugee population; increasing food availability and dietary diversity for the most vulnerable and food-insecure nonrefugee population; and establishing linkages with the Palestinian private sector (shopkeepers, farms, and factories) to produce and deliver the aid being provided to Palestinians. For example, the project directly distributed a standard food ration through both direct food distribution and electronic food vouchers to vulnerable nonrefugee families. Governance and Civic Engagement. The smallest share—about 6 percent—of USAID’s fiscal years 2015 and 2016 ESF project assistance for the West Bank and Gaza supported the agency’s Governance and Civic Engagement development objective. According to USAID documents, as of March 31, 2018, USAID had obligated about $24.6 million and expended approximately $14.5 million (about 60 percent) for projects in program areas that included civil society, good governance, and rule of law. The largest project funded under this objective—a contract for the Communities Thrive Project— received about $5.2 million and $8 million in fiscal years 2015 and 2016 ESF assistance, respectively. The project aimed to help 55 West Bank municipalities improve fiscal management, fiscal accountability and transparency, and delivery and management of municipal services, among other things. Under debt relief grant agreements with the PA, USAID made direct payments of ESF assistance to PA creditors totaling about $75 million from fiscal year 2015 funds and $70 million from fiscal year 2016 funds. USAID paid about $40 million from fiscal year 2015 funds and $45 million from fiscal year 2016 funds to two oil companies to cover debts for petroleum purchases. In addition, USAID paid about $35 million from fiscal year 2015 funds and $25 million from fiscal year 2016 funds to the Bank of Palestine, to pay off a PA line of credit that was used to cover PA medical referrals to six hospitals in the East Jerusalem Hospital network. Before using fiscal years 2015 and 2016 ESF assistance to pay PA creditors, USAID vetted the creditors to ensure that the assistance would not provide support to entities or individuals associated with terrorism, as required by its policies and procedures. USAID determined that certain legal requirements, including the requirement for an assessment of the PA Ministry of Finance and Planning, were not applicable for direct payments of these funds to PA creditors. Nevertheless, USAID continued to commission external assessments and financial audits of the PA Ministries of Health and Finance and Planning. USAID documentation for payments to creditors shows that before signing debt relief agreements with the PA, mission officials checked, as required by Mission Order 21, the vetting status of PA creditors who would receive direct payments under the agreements, to ensure their eligibility before any payment was made. USAID Mission Order 21 requires that before payments to PA creditors are executed, the creditors must be vetted—that is, the creditors’ key individuals and other identifying information must be checked against the federal Terrorist Screening Center database and other information sources to determine whether they have links to terrorism. According to USAID policies and procedures, each PA creditor must be vetted if more than 12 months have passed since the last time the creditor was vetted and approved to receive ESF payments. We found that for payments made to PA creditors using fiscal years 2015 and 2016 ESF assistance, USAID vetted each PA creditor that received payments and completed the vetting during the 12- month period before the debt relief agreements with the PA were signed (see table 3). USAID determined that certain legal requirements applicable to cash transfers to the PA were not applicable to direct payments to PA creditors of fiscal years 2015 and 2016 ESF assistance. In September 2015, we reported that USAID ceased making cash payments directly to the PA in 2014 and began making payments of ESF assistance directly to PA creditors. In reviewing USAID’s compliance with key legal requirements, we found that USAID had complied with the requirements when making cash transfers to the PA in fiscal year 2013. However, USAID had determined that some requirements were not applicable to direct payments made to PA creditors in fiscal year 2014, because no funds were being provided directly to the PA. After fiscal year 2015, USAID further defined the scope of statutory requirements it deemed applicable to payments to PA creditors using fiscal years 2015 and 2016 ESF assistance, under the rationale that these payments do not constitute direct payments to the PA. Specifically, according to USAID, the agency determined that the following statutory requirements discussed in our prior report were not applicable to direct payments to PA creditors. A requirement to notify the Committees on Appropriations 15 days before obligating funds for a cash transfer to the PA A requirement for the PA to maintain cash transfer funds in a separate account A requirement for the President to waive the prohibition on providing funds to the PA and to submit an accompanying report to the Committees on Appropriations A requirement for the Secretary of State to provide a certification and accompanying report to the Committees on Appropriations when the President waives the prohibition on providing funds to the PA Requirements for direct government-to-government assistance, including an assessment of the PA Ministry of Finance and Planning According to USAID officials, they currently do not plan to resume cash payments to the PA, because making direct payments to creditors minimizes the misuse of funds and assures full transparency and appropriateness of transfers. Although USAID concluded that the statutory requirement mandating assessments of the PA Ministry of Finance and Planning did not apply to direct payments to PA creditors, the West Bank and Gaza mission commissioned external assessments of the PA Ministry of Health’s medical referral services and Ministry of Finance and Planning’s petroleum procurement system. According to a USAID document, while the payments to the creditors did not constitute direct budget support to the PA, the agency chose to commission external assessments to determine whether the PA’s financial systems were sufficient to ensure adequate accountability for USAID funds consistent with legislative requirements for direct budget support funds. These external assessments identified weaknesses in both systems. Ministry of Health medical referrals. The assessment report stated that the ministry did not have approved policies and procedures for the medical referral process, a list of medical services covered by the referral system, and written criteria for selecting referral hospitals in the medical referral systems. In response, in a January 2016 internal memorandum, the West Bank and Gaza mission officials concluded, among other things, that the findings did not pose a significant risk to USAID funds. They also stated that the Ministry of Health’s medical referral system had adequate policies and procedures for referrals to local hospitals. However, after the assessment report was issued, a USAID contractor worked with the Ministry of Health to update, revise, and approve guidelines for medical referrals. Ministry of Finance and Planning petroleum procurements. The assessment report stated that the ministry lacked specific policies and procedures to prevent or detect fraud in the petroleum procurement systems. In the West Bank and Gaza mission’s January 2016 memorandum, USAID mission officials disagreed with the assessment’s findings regarding the petroleum procurement system, stating that the assessment did not take into account sufficient and adequate internal controls at the ministry as a first line of defense against fraud. The memorandum also stated that the finding did not affect USAID debt relief payments to the PA creditors. USAID officials told us that, while they did not believe the external assessments’ findings affected the integrity of USAID’s debt relief payment process, they took four additional steps to mitigate findings noted in the assessment of the Ministry of Finance and Planning’s fuel procurement processes. According to USAID officials, they (1) confirmed that the fuel companies had controls and systems to ensure an objective and transparent system in receiving and recording PA orders, (2) dispatched orders with official and properly signed shipping delivery and receipt documents, (3) obtained written confirmation from the fuel companies of the costs of the fuel provided to the PA, and (4) confirmed the PA’s petroleum debt with the fuel companies before initiating the payments and after making the payments. In addition, in 2016, USAID commissioned two routine financial audits of the debt relief grant agreed to by USAID and the PA for the use of fiscal year 2015 ESF assistance to make direct payments to PA creditors. According to USAID officials, the auditors were to examine the PA Ministry of Finance and Planning’s recording of USAID payments to PA creditors in its financial records as well as the ministry’s and USAID’s compliance with the terms of the grant agreement and related implementation letters. The audits did not identify any questioned or ineligible costs, reportable material weaknesses in internal control, or material instances of noncompliance with the terms of the debt relief grant. Also, in 2017, USAID contracted for a financial audit of the fiscal year 2016 debt relief grant agreed to by USAID and the PA. According to a USAID document, in May 2018, USAID held an entrance conference with the PA Ministry of Finance and Planning for the audit of the fiscal year 2016 grant. In July 2018, USAID sent the final audit report to the Regional Inspector General for review. According to the USAID document, the report did not identify any questioned or ineligible costs, reportable material weaknesses in internal controls, or material instances of noncompliance with the terms of the grant. We provided a draft of this report to USAID and State for review and comment. USAID provided comments, which we have reproduced in appendix II, as well as technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. State did not provide comments. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Administrator of USAID, and the Secretary of State. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-3149 or gootnickd@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who contributed to this report are listed in appendix III. Appropriations acts for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 included provisions for GAO to review the treatment, handling, and uses of funds provided through the ESF for assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. This report examines (1) the status of ESF assistance and projects provided to the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, including payments to PA creditors, and (2) the extent to which USAID conducted required vetting of PA creditors to ensure that assistance would not support entities or individuals associated with terrorism and assessed PA ministries’ capacity to use ESF assistance as intended. To address our first objective, we reviewed appropriations legislation, related budget justification documents, and financial data for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, including expenditures as of March 31, 2018, provided by USAID’s West Bank and Gaza mission in Tel Aviv, Israel. We reviewed data that USAID provided on obligations and expenditures of all ESF assistance for the West Bank and Gaza as of March 31, 2018, from annual allocations for fiscal years 2015 and 2016. We also reviewed relevant USAID documents, including notifications to Congress regarding the use of appropriated funds. In addition, we interviewed USAID and State officials in Washington, D.C., and Tel Aviv. To determine whether the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report, we requested and reviewed information from USAID officials about their procedures for entering contract and financial information into USAID’s data system. We determined that the USAID data were sufficiently reliable. For the project information included in this report, we relied on data that USAID provided, showing its obligations and expenditures of fiscal year 2015 and 2016 ESF assistance for West Bank and Gaza. For illustrative purposes, we requested and obtained from USAID descriptions of projects that, according to USAID officials, represented the largest financial obligations for each development objective in fiscal years 2015 and 2016. To address our second objective, we identified and reviewed relevant legal requirements as well as USAID policies and procedures to comply with those requirements. USAID Mission Order 21 is the primary document that details USAID procedures to ensure that the mission’s assistance program does not provide support to entities or individuals associated with terrorism, consistent with the prohibition on such support found in relevant laws and executive orders. In addition, we reviewed 27 USAID determinations of compliance for payments to PA creditors and discussed with USAID mission officials their efforts to comply with the policies and procedures in Mission Order 21 before executing payments to hospitals, companies, and banks that facilitated the payments. We also reviewed the timing of USAID’s vetting of each PA creditor that received payments, to ensure that, as required by Mission Order 21, the vetting occurred within 12 months before USAID signed the relevant debt relief grant agreement with the PA. Further, we reviewed external assessments of the PA Ministries of Health and Finance and Planning and financial audits of the PA Ministry of Finance and Planning, and we discussed the assessments’ and audits with USAID officials responsible for payments to PA creditors. We conducted this performance audit from September 2017 to August 2018, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

According to the Department of State, this assistance to the Palestinians promotes U.S. economic and political foreign policy interests by supporting Middle East peace negotiations and financing economic stabilization programs. USAID is primarily responsible for administering ESF assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. Appropriations acts for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 included provisions for GAO to review the treatment, handling, and uses of funds provided through the ESF for assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. This report examines (1) the status of ESF assistance and projects provided to the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, including project assistance and payments to PA creditors, and (2) the extent to which USAID conducted required vetting of PA creditors to ensure that this assistance would not support entities or individuals associated with terrorism and assessed PA ministries' capacity to use ESF assistance as intended. GAO reviewed relevant laws and regulations and USAID financial data, policies, procedures, and documents. GAO also interviewed USAID and State Department officials. As of March 2018, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) had allocated about $545 million of funding appropriated to the Economic Support Fund (ESF) for assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016. USAID obligated about $544 million (over 99 percent) and expended about $351 million (over 64 percent) of the total allocations. Project assistance accounted for approximately $399 million of the obligated funds, while payments to Palestinian Authority (PA) creditors accounted for $145 million (see figure). USAID's obligations for project assistance in the West Bank and Gaza for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 supported three development objectives—Economic Growth and Infrastructure ($239 million), Investing in the Next Generation ($107 million), and Governance and Civic Engagement (about $25 million). In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, USAID made payments directly to PA creditors—two Israeli fuel companies, to cover debts for petroleum purchases, and a local Palestinian bank, to pay off a line of credit used for PA medical referrals to six hospitals in the East Jerusalem Hospital network. USAID vetted PA creditors to ensure that the program assistance would not provide support to entities or individuals associated with terrorism and also conducted external assessments and financial audits of PA ministries of Health and Finance and Planning. USAID documentation showed that, as required, officials checked the vetting status of each PA creditor within 12 months before USAID signed its debt relief grant agreements with the PA. In addition, although USAID determined that it was not legally required to assess the PA Ministry of Health's medical referral services and the Ministry of Finance and Planning's petroleum procurement system, the agency commissioned external assessments of both ministries. These assessments found some weaknesses in both ministries' systems; however, USAID mission officials stated that these weaknesses did not affect USAID debt relief payments to the PA creditors. Nevertheless, USAID took additional steps to mitigate the identified weaknesses. For example, a USAID contractor worked with the Ministry of Health to update, revise, and approve guidelines for medical referrals. In addition, USAID commissioned financial audits of the debt relief grant agreements between USAID and the PA for direct payments to PA creditors in fiscal year 2015 and 2016. The audits did not identify any ineligible costs, reportable material weaknesses in internal control, or material instances of noncompliance with the terms of the agreements.

"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nCongressional interest in small business access to capital has increased in recent years because of concerns that small businesses might be prevented from accessing sufficient capital to enable them to start, continue, or expand operations and create jobs. Small businesses have played an important role in net job growth during previous economic recoveries, particularly in the construction, housing, and retail sectors. For example, after the eight-month recession that began in July 1990 and ended in March 1991, small businesses (defined for this purpose as having fewer than 500 employees) increased their net employment in the first year after the recession, whereas larger businesses continued to experience declines in employment. During the most recent recession (December 2007-June 2009), small businesses accounted for almost 60% of net job losses. From the end of the recession through the end of FY2012, small businesses accounted for about 63% of net new jobs, close to their historical average share of net new job creation. Since then, small businesses have added about 65% of net new jobs. Some have argued that the federal government should provide additional resources to assist small businesses. Others worry about the long-term adverse economic effects of spending programs that increase the federal deficit. They advocate business tax reduction, reform of financial credit market regulation, and federal fiscal restraint as the best means to assist small businesses and create jobs. Several laws were enacted during the 111 th Congress to enhance small business access to capital. For example, P.L. 111-5 , the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), provided the Small Business Administration (SBA) an additional $730 million, including $375 million to temporarily subsidize SBA fees and increase the 7(a) loan guaranty program's maximum loan guaranty percentage from 85% on loans of $150,000 or less and 75% on loans exceeding $150,000 to 90% for all regular 7(a) loans. P.L. 111-240 , the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) ($4.0 billion was issued) to encourage community banks with less than $10 billion in assets to increase their lending to small businesses. It also authorized a $1.5 billion State Small Business Credit Initiative to provide funding to participating states with small business capital access programs, numerous changes to the SBA's loan guaranty and contracting programs, funding to continue the SBA's fee subsidies and the 7(a) program's 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through December 31, 2010, and about $12 billion in tax relief for small businesses. P.L. 111-322 , the Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extensions Act, 2011, authorized the SBA to continue its fee subsidies and the 7(a) program's 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through March 4, 2011, or until available funding was exhausted, which occurred on January 3, 2011. According to the SBA, the temporary fee subsidies and 90% maximum loan guaranty for the 7(a) program ""engineered a significant turnaround in SBA lending.... The end result is that the agency helped put more than $42 billion in the hands of small businesses through the Recovery Act and Jobs Act combined."" This report focuses on the SBLF. It begins with a discussion of the supply and demand for small business loans. The SBLF's advocates argued that the fund was an important part of a larger effort to enhance the supply of small business loans. After describing the program's structure, the report then examines other arguments that were presented both for and against the program's enactment. Advocates claimed the SBLF would increase lending to small businesses and, in turn, create jobs. Opponents contended that the SBLF could lose money, lacked sufficient oversight provisions, did not require lenders to increase their lending to small businesses, could serve as a vehicle for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients to effectively refinance their TARP loans on more favorable terms with little or no resulting benefit for small businesses, and could encourage a failing lender to make even riskier loans to avoid higher dividend payments. The report concludes with an examination of the SBLF's implementation by the Department of the Treasury and a discussion of bills introduced during recent Congresses to amend the SBLF. For example, during the 112 th Congress, S. 681 , the Greater Accountability in the Lending Fund Act of 2011, would have, among other provisions, limited the program's authority to 15 years from enactment and prohibited TARP recipients from participating in the program. H.R. 2807 , the Small Business Leg-Up Act of 2011, would have transferred any unobligated and repaid funds from the SBLF when its investment authority expired on September 27, 2011, to the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund ""to continue the program of making capital investments in eligible community development financial institutions in order to increase the availability of credit for small businesses."" H.R. 3147 , the Small Business Lending Extension Act, would have, among other provisions, extended the Department of the Treasury's investment authority from one year following the date of enactment to two years. During the 113 th Congress, H.R. 2474 , the Community Lending and Small Business Jobs Act of 2013, would have transferred any unobligated and repaid funds from the SBLF to the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. Each quarter, the Federal Reserve Board surveys senior loan officers concerning their bank's lending practices. The survey includes questions about both the supply and demand for small business loans. For example, the survey includes a question concerning their bank's credit standards for small business loans: ""Over the past three months, how have your bank's credit standards for approving applications for C&I [commercial and industrial] loans or credit lines—other than those to be used to finance mergers and acquisitions—for small firms (defined as having annual sales of less than $50 million) changed?"" The senior loan officers are asked to indicate if their bank's credit standards have ""Tightened considerably,"" ""Tightened somewhat,"" ""Remained basically unchanged,"" ""Eased somewhat,"" or ""Eased considerably."" Subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting ""Eased somewhat"" and ""Eased considerably"" from the percentage of respondents reporting ""Tightened considerably"" and ""Tightened somewhat"" provides an indication of the market's supply of small business loans. As shown in Figure 1 , senior loan officers reported that they generally tightened small business loan credit standards from 2007 through late 2009. Since 2009, small business credit markets have generally improved, with some tightening in 2016 and the end of 2018. The survey also includes a question concerning the demand for small business loans: ""Apart from normal seasonal variation, how has demand for C&I loans changed over the past three months for small firms (annual sales of less than $50 million)?"" Senior loan officers are asked to indicate if demand was ""Substantially stronger,"" ""Moderately stronger,"" ""About the same,"" ""Moderately weaker,"" or ""Substantially weaker."" Subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting ""Moderately weaker"" and ""Substantially weaker"" from the percentage of respondents reporting ""Substantially stronger"" and ""Moderately stronger"" provides an indication of the market's demand for small business loans. As shown in Figure 1 , senior loan officers reported that the demand for small business loans declined somewhat in 2007 and 2008, and declined significantly in 2009. Demand then leveled off (at a relatively reduced level) during 2010, increased somewhat during the first half of 2011, declined during the latter half of 2011, generally increased from 2012 through 2015, and has varied somewhat, increasing in some quarters and declining in others, since then. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has maintained comparable small business lending data for the second quarter (June 30) of each year since 2002. Figure 2 shows the amount of outstanding small business loans (defined by the FDIC as commercial and industrial loans of $1 million or less) for nonagricultural purposes as of June 30 of each year from 2006 to 2018. As shown in Figure 2 , the amount of outstanding small business loans for nonagricultural purposes increased at a relatively steady pace from June 30, 2006, to June 30, 2008, declined over the next several years, and has increased each year since June 30, 2013. Although changes in small business outstanding debt are not necessarily a result of changes in the supply of small business loans, many, including the SBA, view a decline in small business outstanding debt as a signal that small businesses might be experiencing difficulty accessing sufficient capital to enable them to lead job growth. According to an SBA-sponsored study of small business lending, several factors contributed to the decline in small business lending from 2007 to 2010. The report's authors noted that the 30% decline in home prices from their peak in 2006 to 2010 diminished the value of collateral for many small business borrowers, some of whom had relied on home equity loans to finance their small businesses during the real estate boom. The authors concluded that the absence of this additional source of collateral may have contributed to a decline in lending to small businesses. They also argued that many small businesses found it increasingly difficult to renew existing lines of credit as lenders became more cautious as a result of slow economic growth and an increasing risk of loan defaults, especially among small business start-ups, which are generally considered among the most risky investments. The authors argued that in this newly regulated market, smaller lenders are likely to be less profitable because they have fewer sales of products and services to spread out over the higher auditing and FDIC costs. Hence, they have less money to lend to small businesses and others; and the relative difficulty in assessing creditworthiness due to the lack of information about potential financial performance is very high in small business lending, especially in financial markets driven by factor—rather than relationship—lending. Therefore, one would expect the small business loan market to recover more slowly than other financial markets. The authors also noted that FDIC data indicated that small business lending had not only declined in absolute terms (the total amount of dollars borrowed and the total number of small business loans issued), but in relative terms as well (the market share of business loans): Over the eight years from 2003 through 2010, small business loans as a share of total business loans declined by more than 12 percentage points, from 81.7% in 2003 to 68.9% in 2010. Perhaps of most concern is the further decline in the ratios of small business loans to total assets and small business loans to total business loans. Small business loans constituted about 16.8% of total assets in 2005, but only 15.3% in 2010; hence, small business lending is becoming less significant for these lenders. Small business lending is also losing market share in the business loan market. In the eight-year period from 2003 to 2010, small business loans as a share of total business loans declined more than 10 percentage points from 81.7% in 2003 to 68.9% in 2010. According to the previously mentioned SBA-sponsored study of small business lending, the demand for small business loans fell during the recession primarily because many small businesses experienced a decline in sales and many small business owners had a heightened level of uncertainty concerning future sales. The study's authors argued that given small business owners' lack of confidence in the demand for their goods and services, many small business owners decided to save capital instead of hiring additional employees and borrowing capital to invest in business expansions and inventory. The responses of small business owners to a monthly survey by the National Federation of Independent Business Research Foundation (NFIB) concerning small business owners' views of the economy support the argument that declining sales contributed to the reduced demand for small business loans. From 2008 through 2011, small business owners responding to the NFIB surveys identified poor sales as their number-one problem. Prior to 2008, taxes had been reported as their number-one problem in nearly every survey since the monthly surveys began in 1986. Also, employment data suggest that small businesses were particularly hard hit by the recession. As mentioned previously, small businesses accounted for almost 60% of the net job losses during the December 2007-June 2009 recession. According to testimony by the Secretary of the Treasury before the House Small Business Committee on June 22, 2011, small businesses were especially hard hit by the recession because [s]mall businesses are concentrated in sectors that were especially hard hit by the recession and the bursting of the housing bubble: construction and real estate. More than one-third of all construction workers are employed by firms with less than 20 workers, and an additional third are employed by businesses with fewer than 100 employees. Just over half of those employed in the real estate, rental, and leasing sectors work for businesses with less than 100 workers on their payrolls. More broadly, the rate of job losses was almost twice as high in small businesses as it was in larger firms during the depths of the crisis. During the 111 th Congress, legislation designed to increase both the supply and demand for small business loans was adopted. For example, Congress provided more than $1.1 billion to temporarily subsidize fees for the SBA's 7(a) and 504/Certified Development Company (504/CDC) loan guaranty programs and to increase the 7(a) program's maximum loan guaranty percentage from 85% on loans of $150,000 or less and 75% on loans exceeding $150,000 to 90% for all regular 7(a) loans (funding was exhausted on January 3, 2011). The fee subsidies were designed to increase the demand for small business loans by reducing the cost of borrowing. The 90% loan guarantee was designed to increase the supply of small business loans by reducing the risk of lending. Congress also provided the SBA additional resources to expand its lending to small businesses. For example, ARRA included a $255 million temporary, two-year small business stabilization program to guarantee loans of $35,000 or less to small businesses for qualified debt consolidation, later named the America's Recovery Capital (ARC) Loan program (the program ceased issuing new loan guarantees on September 30, 2010); an additional $15 million for the SBA's surety bond program and a temporary increase in that program's maximum bond amount from $2 million to $5 million and up to $10 million under certain conditions (the higher maximum bond amounts ended on September 30, 2010); an additional $6 million for the SBA's Microloan program's lending program and an additional $24 million for the Microloan program's technical assistance program; and increased the funds ( leverage ) available to SBA-licensed Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs) to no more than 300% of the company's private capital or $150 million, whichever is less. Several other programs were also enacted during the 111 th Congress to increase the supply of small business loans. For example, ARRA authorized the SBA to establish a temporary secondary market guarantee authority to provide a federal guarantee for pools of first lien 504/CDC program loans that are to be sold to third-party investors. ARRA also authorized the SBA to make below-market interest rate direct loans to SBA-designated ""Systemically Important Secondary Market (SISM) Broker-Dealers"" that would use the loan funds to purchase SBA-guaranteed loans from commercial lenders, assemble them into pools, and sell them to investors in the secondary loan market. P.L. 111-240 extended the SBA's secondary market guarantee authority from two years after the date of ARRA's enactment to two years after the date of the program's first sale of a pool of first lien position 504/CDC loans to a third-party investor (which took place on September 24, 2010). The act also increased the loan guarantee limits for the SBA's 7(a) program from $2 million to $5 million, and for the 504/CDC program from $1.5 million to $5 million for ""regular"" borrowers, from $2 million to $5 million if the loan proceeds are directed toward one or more specified public policy goals, and from $4 million to $5.5 million for manufacturers. It also increased the SBA's Microloan program's loan limit for borrowers from $35,000 to $50,000 and for microlender intermediaries after their first year in the program from $3.5 million to $5 million. In addition, it temporarily increased for one year (through September 26, 2011) the SBA 7(a) Express Program's loan limit from $350,000 to $1 million. The act also authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to establish the $30 billion SBLF and a $1.5 billion State Small Business Credit Initiative to provide funding to participating states with small business capital access programs. The SBLF was designed ""to address the ongoing effects of the financial crisis on small businesses by providing temporary authority to the Secretary of the Treasury to make capital investments in eligible institutions in order to increase the availability of credit for small businesses."" The SBLF's legislative history, including differences in the House- and Senate-passed versions of the program, appears in the Appendix . P.L. 111-240 authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to make up to $30 billion in capital investments in eligible institutions with total assets equal to or less than $1 billion or $10 billion (as of the end of the fourth quarter of calendar year 2009). The authority to make capital investments in eligible institutions was limited to one year after enactment. Eligible financial institutions with total assets equal to or less than $1 billion as of the end of the fourth quarter of calendar year 2009 could apply to receive a capital investment from the SBLF in an amount not exceeding 5% of risk-weighted assets, as reported in the FDIC call report immediately preceding the date of application. During the fourth quarter of 2009, 7,340 FDIC-insured lending institutions reported having assets amounting to less than $1 billion. Eligible financial institutions with total assets of $10 billion or less as of the end of the fourth quarter of calendar year 2009 could apply to receive a capital investment from the fund in an amount not exceeding 3% of risk-weighted assets, as reported in the FDIC call report immediately preceding the date of application. During the fourth quarter of 2009, 565 FDIC-insured lending institutions reported having assets of $1 billion to $10 billion. Risk-weighted assets are assets such as cash, loans, investments, and other financial institution assets that have different risks associated with them. FDIC regulations (12 C.F.R. §567.6) establish that cash and government bonds have a 0% risk-weighting; residential mortgage loans have a 50% risk-weighting; and other types of assets (such as small business loans) have a higher risk-weighting. Lending institutions on the FDIC problem bank list or institutions that have been removed from the FDIC problem bank list for less than 90 days are ineligible to participate in the program. A lending institution can refinance securities issued through the Treasury Capital Purchase Program (CPP) and the Community Development Capital Incentive (CDCI) program under TARP, but only if that institution had not missed more than one dividend payment due under those programs. Participating banks (C corporations and savings associations) are charged a dividend rate of no more than 5% per annum initially, with reduced rates available if the bank increases its small business lending by specified amounts. For example, during any calendar quarter in the initial two years of the capital investments under the program, the bank's dividend rate is lowered if it increases its small business lending, as reported in its FDIC call reports, compared with the average small business lending it made in the four previous quarters immediately preceding the law's enactment, minus some allowable adjustments. Table 1 shows the dividend rates associated with small business lending increases by C corporation banks and savings associations. Table 2 shows the dividend rates associated with small business lending increases by participating S corporation banks and mutual lending institutions. These rates are slightly higher than those for C corporation banks and savings associations ""to reflect after-tax effective rates equivalent to the dividend rate paid by other classes of institutions participating in the Fund through the issuance of preferred stock."" As will be discussed later, an S corporation does not pay federal taxes at the corporate level. Any business income or loss is ""passed through"" to shareholders who report it on their personal income tax returns. Community Development Financial Institutions (CFDIs) are provided funding for an initial eight years with an automatic rollover for two additional years at the issuer's option. On the 10 th anniversary of the investment date the issuer repays the principal amount, together with all accrued and unpaid interest. Additionally, the dividend rate is 2% per annum for the first eight years from the investment date (payable quarterly in arrears on January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1 of each year) and 9% thereafter. SBLF applicants are required to submit a small business lending plan to the appropriate federal banking agency and, for applicants that are state-chartered banks, to the appropriate state banking regulator. The plan must describe how the applicant's business strategy and operating goals will allow it to address the needs of small businesses in the areas it serves, as well as a plan to provide linguistically and culturally appropriate outreach, where appropriate. The plan is treated as confidential supervisory information. The Secretary of the Treasury is required to consult with the appropriate federal banking agency or, in the case of an eligible institution that is a nondepository community development financial institution, the Community Development Financial Institution Fund, before determining if the eligible institution may participate in the program. The act directed that all funds received by the Secretary of the Treasury in connection with purchases made by the SBLF, ""including interest payments, dividend payments, and proceeds from the sale of any financial instrument, shall be paid into the general fund of the Treasury for reduction of the public debt."" The SBLF's advocates argued that it would create jobs by encouraging lenders, especially those experiencing liquidity problems (access to cash and easily tradable assets), to increase their lending to small businesses. For example, the House report accompanying H.R. 5297 , the Small Business Lending Fund Act of 2010, argued that the SBLF was needed to enhance small business's access to capital, which, in turn, was necessary to enable those businesses to create jobs and assist in the economic recovery: There has been a dramatic decrease in the amount of bank lending in the past several quarters. On May 20, 2010, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) released its Quarterly Banking Profile for the first quarter of 2010. The report shows that commercial and industrial loans declined for the seventh straight quarter, down more than 17% from the year before. Many companies, particularly small businesses, claim that it is becoming harder to get new loans to keep their business operating and that banks are tightening requirements or cutting off existing lines of credit even when the businesses are up to date on their loan repayments. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner recently acknowledged the problem encountered by some banks, both healthy and troubled, which have been told to maintain capital levels in excess of those required to be considered well capitalized. Some banks say they have little choice but to scale back lending, even to creditworthy borrowers, and the most recent Federal Reserve data shows banks are continuing to tighten lending terms for small businesses. A dissenting view, endorsed by the House Committee on Financial Services' minority members, was included in the report. This view argued that the SBLF does not properly deal with the lack of financing for small businesses: Instead of addressing the problem by stimulating demand for credit by small businesses, H.R. 5297 injects capital into banks with no guarantees that they will actually lend. The bill allows a qualifying bank to obtain a capital infusion from the government without even requiring the bank to make a loan for two years. In fact, if a bank reduces or fails to increase lending to small business during those first two years, it would not face any penalty. It defies logic that the Majority would support a bill to increase lending that does not actually require increased lending. A more effective response to the challenges facing America's small businesses was offered by Representatives Biggert, Paulsen, Castle, Gerlach, and King, whose amendment would have extended a series of small business tax credits before implementing the Small Business Lending Fund. Advocates also argued that even if the SBLF were authorized ""the program probably would not be fully operational for months; banks could shun the program for fear of being stigmatized by its association with TARP; and many banks would avoid taking on new liabilities when their existing assets are troubled."" They contended that the bill did not provide sufficient oversight for effectively monitoring the program because the Inspector General of the Department of the Treasury, who was given that oversight responsibility under the bill, ""might not be able to direct sufficient attention to this task given its other responsibilities."" They argued that the Special Inspector General of TARP would be in a better position to provide effective oversight of the program. These, and other, arguments were presented during House floor debate on the bill. For example, Representative Melissa Bean advocated the bill's passage, arguing that the SBLF builds on the effective financial stabilization measures Congress has previously taken by establishing a new $30 billion small business loan fund to provide additional capital to community banks that increase lending to small businesses. This $30 billion investment on which the government will be collecting dividends and earning a profit per the CBO [Congressional Budget Office] estimates can be leveraged by banks into over $300 billion in new small business loans. This is an important investment by the Federal Government in our small business that brings tremendous returns. The terms of the capital provided to banks are performance based; the more a bank increases its small business lending, the lower the dividend rate is for the SBLF capital. If a bank decreases its small business lending, it will be penalized with higher dividend rates. This legislation includes strong safeguards to ensure that banks adequately utilize available funds to increase lending to small businesses, not for other lending or to improve their balance sheet. There will be oversight consistently throughout the program, plus it requires that the capital be invested only in strong financial institutions at little risk of default and the best positioned to increase small business lending. It's important for Americans to understand that although this fund has a maximum value of $30 billion, it is estimated to make a profit for taxpayers in the long run. And the money will ultimately go not to banks, but to the small businesses and their communities that they lend to. As our financial system stabilizes and our community banks recapitalize, these funds will be repaid to Treasury with full repayment required over the next 10 years. Representative Nydia Velázquez, then-chair of the House Committee on Small Business, added that the legislation had sufficient safeguards in place to ensure that the funds were targeted at small businesses: First, banks must apply to the Treasury to receive funds, with a detailed plan on how to increase small business lending at their institution. This language was included at my insistence that we need to make sure that small businesses will get the benefit of this legislation. Second, this capital, repayment of the government loans will be at a dividend rate starting at 5% per year. This rate will be lowered by 1% for every 2.5% increase in small business lending over 2009 levels. It can go as low as a total dividend rate of just 1% if the bank increases its business lending by 10% or more, incentivizing banks to do the right thing. To ensure that banks actually use the funding they receive, the rate will increase—and there are penalties—to 7% if the bank fails to increase its small business lending at their institution within 2 years. To ensure that all federal funds are paid back within 5 years, the dividend rate will increase to 9% for all banks, irrespective of their small business lending, after 4 1/2 years. Representative Velázquez added ""let me just make it clear … CBO estimates that [the SBLF] will save taxpayers $1 billion over 10 years, as banks are expected to pay back this loan over 10 years, with interest."" Representative Randy Neugebauer opposed the bill's adoption, arguing that the majority is repeating the same failed initiatives that have helped our national debt grow to $13 trillion in the past 2 years. This bill follows the model of the TARP program, minus [TARP's] stronger oversight, and it puts another $30 billion into banks in the hopes that lending to small businesses will increase. In the words of Neil Barofsky, the Special Inspector General who oversees the TARP, ""In terms of its basic design,"" he says, ""its participants, its application process, from an oversight perspective, the Small Business Lending Fund would essentially be an extension of the TARP's Capital Purchase Program."" From the Congressional Oversight Panel for TARP, chaired by Elizabeth Warren, she says, ""The SBLF's prospects are far from certain. The SBLF also raises questions about whether, in light of the Capital Purchase Program's poor performance in improving credit access, any capital infusion program can successfully jump-start small business lending."" This bill allows for another $33 billion in spending that will be added to the government's credit card. The CBO tells us that the bank lending portion will ultimately cost taxpayers $3.4 billion when market risk is taken into account. The House passed H.R. 5297 by a vote of 241-182, on June 17, 2010. The arguments presented during House floor debate on H.R. 5297 were also presented during Senate consideration of the bill. Advocates argued that the SBLF would encourage higher levels of small business lending and jobs. For example, Senator Mary Landrieu argued on July 21, 2010, that the SBLF should be adopted because it ""is not a government program for banks. It is a public-private partnership lending strategy for small business."" She added that as chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, she talked with her colleagues, including the SBLF's opponents, and revised the program to address their concerns. She also argued that the SBLF has hundreds of endorsements from independent banks, the community banks and almost every small business association in America … makes $1 billion [according to the CBO score] … is not direct lending from the federal government. It is not creating a new bureaucracy … [It is] voluntary … there are no onerous restrictions.… The small business gets the loans. We create jobs. People are employed. The recession starts ending…. It has nothing to do with TARP money. It is not a TARP program. It is not a bank program. It doesn't have anything to do with banks except that we are working in partnership with banks to lend money to small businesses which are desperate for money. Opponents argued that the SBLF could lose money, lacked sufficient oversight provisions, did not require lenders to increase their lending to small businesses, could serve as a vehicle for TARP recipients to effectively refinance their TARP loans on more favorable terms with little or no resulting benefit for small businesses, and could encourage a failing lender to make even riskier loans to avoid higher dividend payments. In addition, there were disagreements over the number of amendments that could be offered by the minority, which led several Senators to oppose further consideration of the bill until that issue was resolved to their satisfaction. For example, on July 22, 2010, Senator Olympia Snowe argued that although ""under a cash-based estimate, CBO listed the official score for the lending fund as raising $1.1 billion over 10 years,"" SBLF proponents ""fail to mention"" that when CBO scored the SBLF using an alternative methodology that adjusts for market risk, it estimated that the SBLF could cost $6.2 billion. Senator Snowe also argued that the bipartisan Congressional Oversight Panel for TARP stated in its May 2010 oversight report that the proposed SBLF ""substantially resembles"" the TARP and ""is a bank-focused capital infusion program that is being contemplated despite little, if any, evidence that such programs increase lending."" Senator Snowe noted that she regretted ""that we are in a position where we have not been able to reach agreement allowing the minority to offer amendments, which is confounding and perplexing as well as disappointing."" Senator Snowe later added that the SBLF's incentives to encourage lending to small businesses also ""could encourage unnecessarily risky behavior by banks … to avoid paying higher interest rates."" Opponents also questioned the SBLF's use of quarterly call report data as submitted by lenders to their appropriate banking regulator to determine what counts as a small business loan. Call report data denotes loans of $1 million or less as small business loans, regardless of the size of the business receiving the loan. As a result, the SBLF's opponents argued that ""the data used to measure small business lending in the SBLF covers an entirely different set of small businesses than those that fall within the definition set out in the Small Business Act or used by the SBA."" The Senate's version of H.R. 5297 was agreed to on September 16, 2010, by a vote of 68-38. The House agreed to the Senate-passed version of H.R. 5297 on September 23, 2010, by a vote of 237-187, and the bill, retitled the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, was signed into law by President Obama on September 27, 2010. On February 14, 2011, the Obama Administration issued its budget recommendation for FY2012. The budget anticipated that the SBLF would provide $17.399 billion in financings, well below its authorized amount of $30 billion. This was the first indication that the SBLF's implementation may not proceed as expected. The second indication that the program's implementation may not proceed as expected was an unanticipated delay in the writing of the program's regulations. The U.S. Treasury was criticized by some for not implementing the program quickly enough. The first financing took place on June 21, 2011, about nine months after the program's enactment. The delay was largely due to the Treasury's need to finalize the SBLF's investment decision process with federal banking agencies and the need to create separate SBLF regulations for financial institutions established as C corporations, Subchapter S corporations, mutual lending institutions, and Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs). A C corporation is a legal entity established under state law and includes shareholders, directors, and officers. The profit of a C corporation is taxed to the corporation when earned and then is taxed to the shareholders when distributed as dividends. The majority of insured depository institutions, bank holding companies, and savings and loan holding companies are C corporations. A Subchapter S c orporation refers to a section of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) that allows a corporation to pass corporate income, losses, deductions, and credits through to its shareholders for federal tax purposes. Shareholders of S corporations report the flow-through of income and losses on their personal tax returns and are assessed tax at their individual income tax rates. This allows S corporations to avoid double taxation on the corporate income. Mutual lending institutions , which include many thrifts, are owned by their depositors or policyholders. They have no stockholders. CDFIs are financial entities certified by the CDFI Fund in the U.S. Department of the Treasury and provide capital and financial services to underserved communities. The establishment of separate regulations for each of these different types of financial institutions was largely related to issues involving whether the SBLF's financings would be counted by banking regulatory agencies as Tier 1 capital (core capital that is relatively liquid, such as common shareholders' equity, disclosed reserves, most retained earnings, and perpetual noncumulative preferred stocks) or as Tier 2 capital (supplementary capital that consists mainly of undisclosed reserves, revaluation reserves, general provisions, hybrid instruments, and subordinated term debt). The treatment of the SBLF's financings was important given that banks must maintain a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (the ratio measures bank capital against assets, with asset values risk-weighted, or adjusted on a scale of riskiness) to be considered adequately capitalized by federal banking regulators. In addition, banks must maintain a minimum Tier 1 risk-based ratio to assets, typically 3% for banking institutions with the highest financial ratings and 4% for others. According to Treasury officials, under Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules, S corporations can have only a single class of stock (common shares). Consequently, these institutions cannot issue preferred stock to Treasury. As a result, Treasury had to consider purchasing subordinated debt from these institutions, which the banking regulatory agencies would likely designate as Tier 2 capital. Treasury officials believed that providing Tier 2 capital would probably result in fewer S corporation participants. Additionally, because mutual lending institutions do not issue stock, Treasury officials were unable to receive preferred stock as consideration for an investment in this type of institution. Therefore, Treasury had to consider purchasing subordinated debt from these institutions as well. Treasury completed its regulations for C corporation banks first. For C corporations, SBLF funds are treated as Tier I capital and the Treasury purchases senior perpetual noncumulative preferred stock (or an equivalent). The stock pays a quarterly dividend on the first day of each quarter after closing of the SBLF capital program funding. Tier 1 capital is the core measure of a bank's financial strength from a regulator's point of view. It is composed of core capital, which consists primarily of common stock and disclosed reserves (or retained earnings) but may also include nonredeemable, noncumulative preferred stock. In contrast, S corporations and mutual lending institutions receive unsecured subordinated debentures from the Treasury, which are considered Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital requirements. The application deadline for C corporation banks was May 16, 2011. The application deadline for Subchapter S corporations and mutual lending institutions was June 6, 2011, and the application deadline for CDFIs was June 22, 2011. A total of 926 institutions applied for $11.8 billion in SBLF funding. Treasury approved more than $4.0 billion in SBLF financing to 332 lending institutions ($3.9 billion to 281 community banks and $104 million to 51 CDFIs). SBLF recipients have offices located in 47 states and the District of Columbia. The average financing was $12.1 million, ranging from $42,000 to $141.0 million. Of the 332 lending institutions which received financing, 137 institutions had participated in TARP's Community Development Capital Initiative or its Capital Purchase Program. These institutions received nearly $2.7 billion in SBLF financing (66.8% of the total). Treasury is required to publish monthly reports describing all transactions made under the SBLF program during the reporting period. It is also required to publish a semiannual report (each March and September) providing all projected costs and liabilities, operating expenses, and transactions made by the SBLF, including a list of all participating institutions and the amounts each institution has received under the program. Treasury must also publish a quarterly report describing how participating institutions have used the funds they have received. SBLF participants must submit an initial supplemental report to Treasury no later than five business days before closing. The report provides information from the institution's FDIC call reports or, for holding companies, from their subsidiaries' FDIC call reports, that Treasury uses to establish an initial baseline for measuring the SBLF participants' progress in making loans to small businesses. The initial baseline is the average amount of qualified small business lending that was outstanding for the four full quarters ending on June 30, 2010. It is derived by first adding the outstanding amount of lending reported for all commercial and industrial loans, owner-occupied nonfarm, nonresidential real estate loans, loans to finance agricultural production and other loans to farmers, and loans secured by farmland. Then, the outstanding amount of lending for large loans (defined as any loan or group of loans greater than $10 million), loans to large businesses (defined as businesses with annual revenues greater than $50 million), and the portion of any loans guaranteed by the U.S. government or for which the risk is assumed by a third party is subtracted from that amount. The lending institution then adds back any cumulative charge-offs with respect to such loans since July 1, 2010. This last adjustment is done to prevent lending institutions from being penalized for appropriately charging off loans. Each SBLF participant's small business lending baseline is also adjusted to take into account any gains in qualified small business lending during the four baseline quarters resulting from mergers, acquisitions, and loan purchases. This adjustment is designed to ensure that dividend rate reductions provided to any SBLF participant correspond to additional lending to small businesses and not to the acquisition of existing loans. In addition, the cumulative baseline for all SBLF participants will decrease over time as SBLF participants repay their SBLF loans and exit the program. For example, the initial small business lending baseline for the 332 SBLF participants as of March 31, 2011, was $35.52 billion ($34.75 billion for 281 banks and $770.48 million for 51 CDFIs). The small business lending baseline for the 50 institutions that continued to participate in the SBLF as of December 31, 2018, was $1.5 billion ($808.8 million for 7 banks and $714.5 million for 43 CDFIs). Table 3 provides the number and type of SBLF participating institutions, the small business lending baseline, the amount of small business lending by participants, the change in small business lending by participants, and the change in small business lending by both current and former participants from 2011 to 2018. The number of SBLF participating institutions is declining as institutions repay their loans and exit the program. As Treasury anticipated, this decline has accelerated following the first quarter of 2016 because the dividend rates for C corporation banks and savings associations and for S corporation banks and mutual lending institutions were increased at that time (to 9% and 13.8%, respectively). SBLF institutions are also required to submit quarterly supplemental reports, due in the calendar quarter following submission of the initial supplemental report and in each of the next nine quarters, to determine their dividend rate for the next quarter. Using information contained in the quarterly supplemental reports, Treasury announced in its April 2019 quarterly report on SBLF Participants' Small Business Lending Growth that, as of December 31, 2018 The 50 current SBLF participants (7 banks and 43 CDFIs) increased their small business lending by $1.347 billion over a $1.523 billion baseline. Since inception, the total increase in small business lending reported by both current and former SBLF participants is more than $19.1 billion over the baseline. All seven of the currently participating community banks and 39 of the 43 currently participating CDLFs increased their small business lending over baseline levels. Most current participants report that their small business lending increases have been substantial, with 43 of 50 current SBLF participants (86.0%) increasing small business lending by 10% or more. Treasury officials have praised the SBLF's performance. For example, on October 9, 2012, then-Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Neal Wolin announced that the SBLF quarterly use of funds report released that day ""is further indication that the Administration's Small Business Lending Fund is continuing to help create an environment in which entrepreneurial small businesses can succeed and excel."" He added that ""banks in the SBLF program continue to show large increases in the lending available for small businesses to grow, create jobs, and support families in communities across the country."" Some financial commentators have expressed a somewhat less sanguine view of the program's performance. For example, one commentator noted, after the release of the quarterly use of funds report in January 2012, that although the report of increased small business lending was positive news ""it is difficult to isolate the proportion of new lending that would have occurred anyway"" due to improvements in the economy. Another commentator noted that the data may have been skewed by SBLF participants who were entering the small business lending market for the first time, making the increases appear larger and more significant than they actually are; yet another noted that the reported growth in small business lending occurred over six quarters (since June 30, 2010) and that the results, although positive, are ""not as impressive as it may seem."" A commentator argued in September 2012 that ""if the SBLF ends up being a success story, it will have been on a far smaller scale than either Obama or Congress had originally expected. What's more, it's become clear that even boatloads of financing won't change the fact that demand for the loans themselves has also fallen off, as small businesses themselves are reluctant to expand in a stagnant economy."" In addition, on August 29, 2013, Treasury's Office of Inspector General (OIG) released an audit of Treasury's reporting of small business lending gains relative to small business lending levels prior to the lenders' participation in the program. The OIG found that ""small business lending gains reported by Treasury are significantly overstated and cannot be linked directly to SBLF funding."" Specifically, the OIG noted that ""substantial amounts [$3.4 billion of the then reported $8.9 billion] of the reported gains occurred prior to participants receiving SBLF funding."" As the OIG explained, the lending gains reported [by Treasury] were measured against the same baseline period that the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 (the Act) instructs Treasury to use for setting dividend rates for repayment of the SBLF capital, which is the four calendar quarters [which] ended [on] June 30, 2010. However, measuring program performance against a baseline with a midpoint seven quarters prior to when most participants received funding inflates program accomplishments and is not responsive to provisions in the Act that direct Treasury to report on participant use of the SBLF funds received. The OIG also argued that the reported lending gains cannot be directly linked to the SBLF capital that Treasury invested in the financial institutions because the lending gains reported ""represent all small business lending gains that institutions participating in the SBLF achieved, regardless of how the loans were funded."" In addition, the OIG noted, among other findings, that ""a relatively small number (35 or 11%) of SBLF participants accounted for half of small business lending increases between the baseline figure and December 31, 2012."" During the 112 th Congress, several bills were introduced to change the SBLF. None of the bills were enacted. For example, then-Senator Snowe introduced S. 681 , the Greater Accountability in the Lending Fund Act of 2011, on March 30, 2011. Senator Snowe argued that While I would prefer to terminate this fund altogether, it is unlikely based on the current political environment, which is why we must work to protect taxpayers from some of its most egregious provisions. My goal with this legislation is to ensure that only healthy banks have access to taxpayer money, that they are required to repay loans within a reasonable period of time, and that small businesses find the affordable credit they need. The bill would have, among other things, required recipients to repay SBLF distributions within 10 years of the receipt of the investment; terminated the program no later than 15 years after the date of the bill's enactment; prohibited the Secretary of the Treasury from making capital investments under the program if the FDIC is appointed receiver of 5% or more of the institutions receiving an investment under the program; prohibited participation by any institution that received an investment under TARP (effective on the date of the bill's enactment); removed provisions allowing the Secretary of Treasury to make a capital investment in institutions that would otherwise not be recommended to receive the investment based on the institution's financial condition, but are able to provide a matching investment from private, nongovernmental investors; required the approval of appropriate financial regulators when determining whether an institution should receive a capital investment; and revised the benchmark against which changes in the amount of small business lending is measured from the four full quarters immediately preceding the date of enactment to calendar year 2007. In addition, H.R. 1387 , the Small Business Lending Fund Accountability Act of 2011, would have provided the Special Inspector General for TARP responsibility for providing oversight over the SBLF. S.Amdt. 279 to S. 493 , the Small Business Innovation Research, Small Business Technology Transfer Reauthorization Act of 2011, would have prevented TARP recipients from using funds received in any form under any other federal assistance program, including the SBLF program. H.R. 2807 , the Small Business Leg-Up Act of 2011, would have transferred any unobligated and repaid funds from the SBLF to the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund beginning on the date when the Secretary of the Treasury's authority to make capital investments in eligible institutions expired (on September 27, 2011). The bill's stated intent was ""to increase the availability of credit for small businesses."" H.R. 3147 , the Small Business Lending Extension Act, would have extended the Department of the Treasury's investment authority from one year following enactment to two years and required the Treasury Secretary to provide any institution not selected for participation in the program the reason for the rejection, ensure that the rejection reason remains confidential, and establish an appeal process that provides the institution an opportunity to contest the reason provided for the rejection of its application. During the 113 th Congress, H.R. 2474 , the Community Lending and Small Business Jobs Act of 2013, would have, among other provisions, transferred any unobligated and repaid funds from the SBLF to the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. The SBLF was enacted as part of a larger effort to enhance the supply of capital to small businesses. Advocates argued that the SBLF would help to address the decline in small business lending and create jobs. Opponents were not convinced that it would enhance small business lending and worried about the program's potential cost to the federal treasury and its similarities to TARP. Participating institutions are reporting they have increased their small business lending. However, as has been discussed, questions have been raised concerning the validity of these reported amounts. Specifically, as Treasury's OIG argued in its August 2013 audit, more than one-third of the reported lending gains at that time occurred prior to September 30, 2011, the quarter in which most SBLF participants received their SBLF funds; the reported small business lending gains reflect all of the small business lending gains that the participants achieved, regardless of how the loans were funded; and previous OIG audits ""have shown that a large number of participants misreport their small business lending activity."" In those previous audits, ""50% or more of the institutions reviewed submitted erroneous lending data to Treasury, either overstating or understating their small business lending gains."" In addition to questions related to the validity of the reported small business lending gains, any analysis of the program's influence on small business lending is likely to be more suggestive than definitive because differentiating the SBLF's effect on small business lending from other factors, such as changes in the lender's local economy, is methodologically challenging, especially given the relatively small amount of financing involved relative to the national market for small business loans. The SBLF's $4.0 billion in financing represents less than 0.7% of outstanding small business loans (as defined by the FDIC). In terms of the concerns expressed about the program's potential cost, Treasury initially estimated in December 2010 that the SBLF could cost taxpayers up to $1.26 billion (excluding administrative costs that were initially estimated at about $26 million annually but actual outlays were $4.54 million in FY2014, $9.05 million in FY2015, $5.01 million in FY2016, and $3.4 million in FY2017). Treasury based that estimate on an expectation that about $17 billion in SBLF financings would be disbursed. In October 2011, Treasury estimated the program's costs based on actual participant data. It estimated that the SBLF would generate a savings of $80 million (excluding administrative costs), with the savings coming primarily from a lower-than-expected financing level and, to a lesser extent, improvements in projected default rates ""due to higher participant quality than expected"" and lower market interest rates. Treasury issues a semiannual report on SBLF costs. In its latest semiannual cost report, released on August 16, 2018, Treasury estimated that the SBLF will ""generate a lifetime positive return of $31 million [excluding administrative costs] for the Treasury General Fund."" One issue that arose relative to the program's projected cost is the noncumulative treatment of dividends. Treasury's OIG reported in May 2011 that Under the terms set by legislation, dividend payments are non-cumulative, meaning that institutions are under no obligation to make dividend payments as scheduled or to pay off previously missed payments before exiting the program. This dividend treatment differs from the TARP programs, in which many dividend payments were cumulative. This change in dividend treatment was driven by changes in capital requirements mandated by the Collins Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act. The amendment equalizes the consolidated capital requirements for Tier 1 capital of bank holding companies by requiring that, at a minimum, regulators apply the same capital and risk standards for FDIC-insured banks to bank holding companies. Under TARP, the FRB [Federal Reserve Board] and FDIC treated capital differently at the holding company and depository institution levels. The FRB treated cumulative securities issued by holding companies as Tier 1 capital, while FDIC treated non-cumulative securities issued by depository institutions as Tier 1 capital. In order to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act requirement that securities purchased from holding companies receive the same capital treatment as those purchased from depository institutions, Treasury made the dividends under SBLF non-cumulative. Additionally, given that Tier 1 capital must be perpetual and cannot have a mandatory redemption date, the 10-year repayment period in the Small Business Jobs Act cannot be enforced. Treasury addressed this issue by placing the following additional requirements and restrictions on participants who miss dividend payments: the participant's CEO [Chief Executive Office] and CFO [Chief Financial Officer] must provide written notice regarding the rationale of the board of directors (BOD) for not declaring a dividend; no repurchases may be affected and no dividends may be declared on any securities for the applicable quarter and the following three quarters; after four missed payments (consecutive or not), the issuer's BOD must certify in writing that the issuer used best efforts to declare and pay dividends appropriately; after five missed payments (consecutive or not), Treasury may appoint a representative to serve as an observer on the issuer's BOD; and after six missed payments (consecutive or not), Treasury may elect two directors to the issuer's BOD if the liquidation preference is $25 million or more. Treasury's OIG agreed that Treasury's equity investment policy is consistent with the legislation and that ""it has reasonably structured the program to incentivize payment of dividends."" However, it recommended that ""Congress consider whether an amendment to the Small Business Jobs Act and/or waiver from the Collins Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act is needed to make the repayment of dividends a requirement for exiting the program."" In conclusion, congressional oversight of the SBLF is currently focused on the program's potential long-term costs and effects on small business lending. Underlying those concerns are fundamental disagreements regarding the best way to assist small businesses. Some advocate the provision of additional federal resources to assist small businesses in acquiring capital necessary to start, continue, or expand operations and create jobs. Others worry about the long-term adverse economic effects of spending programs that increase the federal deficit. They advocate business tax reduction, reform of financial credit market regulation, and federal fiscal restraint as the best means to assist small businesses and create jobs. The SBLF's Legislative Origin On March 16, 2009, President Obama announced the first SBLF-like proposal. Under that proposal, the Department of the Treasury would have used TARP funds to purchase up to $15 billion of SBA-guaranteed loans. The purchases were intended to ""immediately unfreeze the secondary market for SBA loans and increase the liquidity of community banks."" The plan was dropped after it met resistance from lenders. Some lenders objected to TARP's requirement that participating lenders comply with executive compensation limits and issue warrants to the federal government. Smaller, community banks objected to the program's paperwork requirements, such as the provision of a small-business lending plan and quarterly reports. In his January 2010 State of the Union address, President Obama proposed the creation of a $30 billion SBLF to enhance access to credit for small businesses: When you talk to small business owners in places like Allentown, Pennsylvania, or Elyria, Ohio, you find out that even though banks on Wall Street are lending again, they're mostly lending to bigger companies. Financing remains difficult for small business owners across the country, even those that are making a profit. Tonight, I'm proposing that we take $30 billion of the money Wall Street banks have repaid and use it to help community banks give small businesses the credit they need to stay afloat. In response to the opposition community lenders had expressed concerning TARP's restrictions in 2009, the Obama Administration proposed that Congress approve legislation authorizing the transfer of up to $30 billion in TARP spending authority to the SBLF and statutorily establish the new program as distinct and independent from TARP and its restrictions. The Administration's legislative proposal was finalized and sent to Congress on May 7, 2010. Representative Barney Frank, then-chair of the House Committee on Financial Services, introduced H.R. 5297 , the Small Business Lending Fund Act of 2010, on May 13, 2010. The House Committee on Financial Services held a hearing on H.R. 5297 on May 18, 2010, and passed the bill, as amended to include a State Small Business Credit Initiative, the following day. The House passed the bill, as amended to include a Small Business Early-Stage Investment Program, a Small Business Borrower Assistance Program, and some small business tax reduction provisions, on June 17, 2010. The House-Passed Version of the SBLF Title I of the House-passed version of H.R. 5297 authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a $30 billion SBLF ""to address the ongoing effects of the financial crisis on small businesses by providing temporary authority to the Secretary of the Treasury to make capital investments in eligible institutions"" with total assets equal to or less than $1 billion or $10 billion (as of the end of the fourth quarter of calendar year 2009) ""in order to increase the availability of credit for small businesses."" The authority to make capital investments in eligible institutions was limited to one year after enactment. Eligible financial institutions having total assets equal to or less than $1 billion as of the end of the fourth quarter of calendar year 2009 could apply to receive a capital investment from the SBLF in an amount not exceeding 5% of risk-weighted assets, as reported in the FDIC call report immediately preceding the date of application. During the fourth quarter of 2009, 7,340 FDIC-insured lending institutions reported having assets amounting to less than $1 billion. Eligible financial institutions having total assets equal to or less than $10 billion as of the end of the fourth quarter of calendar year 2009 could apply to receive a capital investment from the fund in an amount not exceeding 3% of risk-weighted assets, as reported in the FDIC call report immediately preceding the date of application. During the fourth quarter of 2009, 565 FDIC-insured lending institutions reported having assets of $1 billion to $10 billion. Risk-weighted assets are assets such as cash, loans, investments, and other financial institution assets that have different risks associated with them. FDIC regulations (12 C.F.R. §567.6) establish that cash and government bonds have a 0% risk-weighting; residential mortgage loans have a 50% risk-weighting; and other types of assets (such as small business loans) have a higher risk-weighting. Lending institutions on the FDIC problem bank list or institutions that have been removed from the FDIC problem bank list for less than 90 days were ineligible to participate in the program. Lending institutions could refinance securities issued through the Treasury Capital Purchase Program (CPP) and the Community Development Capital Incentive (CDCI) program under TARP, but only if the institution had not missed more than one dividend payment due under those programs. Participating banks would be charged a dividend rate of no more than 5% per annum initially, with reduced rates available if the bank increased its small business lending. For example, during any calendar quarter in the initial two years of the capital investments under the program, the bank's rate would be lowered if it had increased its small business lending compared to the average small business lending it made in the four previous quarters immediately preceding the enactment of the bill, minus some allowable adjustments. A 2.5% to less than 5% increase in small business lending would have lowered the rate to 4%, a 5% to less than 7.5% increase would have lowered the rate to 3%, a 7.5% to less than 10% increase would have lowered the rate to 2%, and an increase of 10% or greater would have lowered the rate to 1%. Table A-1 shows the dividend rates associated with small business lending increases for C corporation banks and savings institutions under H.R. 5297 . These rates were subsequently included in the final law. The bill also authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to adjust these dividend rates for S corporations ""to take into account any differential tax treatment of securities issued by such eligible institution."" Also, Community Development Financial Institutions were to be charged a dividend rate of 2% per annum for eight years, and 9% thereafter. SBLF applicants were also required to submit a small business lending plan to the appropriate federal banking agency and, for applicants that are state-chartered banks, to the appropriate state banking regulator. The plan was to describe how the applicant's business strategy and operating goals will allow it to address the needs of small businesses in the areas it serves, as well as a plan to provide linguistically and culturally appropriate outreach, where appropriate. The plan was to be treated as confidential supervisory information. The Secretary of the Treasury was required to consult with the appropriate federal banking agency or, in the case of an eligible institution that is a nondepository community development financial institution, the Community Development Financial Institution Fund, before determining if the eligible institution was to participate in the program. The bill specified that the SBLF would be ""established as separate and distinct from the Troubled Asset Relief Program established by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. An institution shall not, by virtue of a capital investment under the Small Business Lending Fund Program, be considered a recipient of the Troubled Asset Relief Program."" The bill also directed that all funds received by the Secretary of the Treasury in connection with purchases made by the SBLF, ""including interest payments, dividend payments, and proceeds from the sale of any financial instrument, shall be paid into the general fund of the Treasury for reduction of the public debt."" The Senate-Passed Version of the SBLF Title IV of the Senate-passed version of H.R. 5297 , which later became law, authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a $30 billion SBLF to make capital investments in eligible community banks with total assets equal to or less than $1 billion or $10 billion. There were several differences between the Senate-passed version of H.R. 5297 's SBLF provisions and the SBLF provisions in the House-passed version of H.R. 5297 . Specifically, the House-passed version of H.R. 5297 indicated that eligible institutions may be insured depository institutions that are not controlled by a bank holding company or a savings and loan holding company that is also an eligible institution and is not directly or indirectly controlled by any company or other entity that has total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion, bank holding companies, savings and loan holding companies, community development financial institution loan funds, and small business lending companies, all with total assets of $10 billion or less (as of the end of 2009). The Senate-passed version of H.R. 5297 did not provide eligibility to small business lending companies. House-passed version of H.R. 5297 defined small business lending ""as small business lending as defined by and reported in an eligible institution's quarterly call report, where each loan comprising such lending is made to a small business and is one the following types: (1) commercial and industrial loans; (2) owner-occupied nonfarm, nonresidential real estate loans; (3) loans to finance agricultural production and other loans to farmers; (4) loans secured by farmland; (5) nonowner-occupied commercial real estate loans; and (6) construction, land development and other land loans."" The Senate-passed version of H.R. 5297 's definition of small business lending did not include nonowner-occupied commercial real estate or construction, land development and other land loans. Senate-passed version of H.R. 5297 had an exclusion provision prohibiting recipient lending institutions from using the funds to issue loans that have an original amount greater than $10 million or that would be made to a business with more than $50 million in revenues. The House-passed version of H.R. 5297 did not contain this provision. House-passed version of H.R. 5297 indicated that the incentives received in the form of reduced dividend rates during the first 4.5-year period following the date on which an eligible institution received a capital investment under the program would be contingent on an increase in the number of loans made. If the number of loans made by the institution did not increase by 2.5% for each 2.5% increase of small business lending, then the rate at which dividends and interest would be payable during the following quarter on preferred stock or other financial instruments issued to the Treasury by the eligible institution would be (i) 5%, if this quarter is within the two-year period following the date on which the eligible institution received the capital investment under the program; or (ii) 7%, if the quarter is after the two-year period. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 5297 did not contain this legislative language. House-passed version of H.R. 5297 included an alternative computation provision that would have allowed eligible institutions to compute their small business lending amounts for incentive purposes as if the definition of their small business lending amounts did not require that the loans comprising such lending be made to small business. This alternative computation would have been allowed if the eligible institution certified that all lending included by the institution for purposes of computing the increase in lending was made to small businesses. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 5297 did not contain this provision. House-passed version of H.R. 5297 indicated that an eligible institution that is a community development loan fund may apply to receive a capital investment from the SBLF in an amount not exceeding 10% of total assets, as reported in the audited financial statements for the fiscal year of the eligible institution that ended in calendar year 2009. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 5297 specifies 5%. House-passed version of H.R. 5297 would have required the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, to develop eligibility criteria to determine the financial ability of a Community Development Loan Fund to participate in the program and repay the investment. It provided a list of recommended eligibility criteria that the Secretary of the Treasury could use for this purpose. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 5297 provided a similar, but mandatory, list of eligibility criteria that must be used for this purpose. House-passed version of H.R. 5297 contained a temporary amortization authority provision which would have allowed an eligible institution to amortize any loss or write-down on a quarterly straight-line basis over a period of time, adjusted to reflect the institution's change in the amount of small business lending relative to the baseline. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 5297 did not contain this provision. The Senate's version of H.R. 5297 was agreed to in the Senate on September 16, 2010, after considerable debate and amendment to remove the Small Business Early-Stage Investment Program and Small Business Borrower Assistance Program, revise the SBLF, and add numerous other provisions to assist small businesses, including additional small business tax reduction provisions. The House agreed to the Senate amendments on September 23, 2010, and President Obama signed the bill, retitled the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-240 ), into law on September 27, 2010.\n\n","['Congressional interest in small business access to capital has increased in recent years because of concerns that small businesses might be prevented from accessing sufficient capital to enable them to start, continue, or expand operations and create jobs. Some have argued that the federal government should provide additional resources to assist small businesses. Others worry about the long-term adverse economic effects of spending programs that increase the federal deficit. They advocate business tax reduction, reform of financial credit market regulation, and federal fiscal restraint as the best means to assist small businesses and create jobs. Several laws were enacted during the 111th Congress to enhance small business access to capital. For example, P.L. 111-5, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), provided the Small Business Administration (SBA) an additional $730 million, including funding to temporarily subsidize SBA fees and increase the 7(a) loan guaranty program\'s maximum loan guaranty percentage to 90%. P.L. 111-240, the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF), in which $4.0 billion was issued, to encourage community banks with less than $10 billion in assets to increase their lending to small businesses. It also authorized a $1.5 billion State Small Business Credit Initiative to provide funding to participating states with small business capital access programs, numerous changes to the SBA\'s loan guaranty and contracting programs, funding to continue the SBA\'s fee subsidies and the 7(a) program\'s 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through December 31, 2010, and about $12 billion in tax relief for small businesses. P.L. 111-322, the Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extensions Act, 2011, authorized the SBA to continue its fee subsidies and the 7(a) program\'s 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage through March 4, 2011, or until available funding was exhausted, which occurred on January 3, 2011. This report focuses on the SBLF. It opens with a discussion of the supply and demand for small business loans. The SBLF\'s advocates claimed the SBLF was needed to enhance the supply of small business loans. The report then examines other arguments presented both for and against the program. Advocates argued that the SBLF would increase lending to small businesses and, in turn, create jobs. Opponents contended that the SBLF could lose money, lacked sufficient oversight provisions, did not require lenders to increase their lending to small businesses, could serve as a vehicle for Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients to effectively refinance their TARP loans on more favorable terms with little or no resulting benefit for small businesses, and could encourage a failing lender to make even riskier loans to avoid higher dividend payments. The report concludes with an examination of the program\'s implementation and a discussion of bills introduced to amend the SBLF. For example, during the 112th Congress, S. 681, the Greater Accountability in the Lending Fund Act of 2011, would have limited the program\'s authority to 15 years from enactment and prohibited TARP recipients from participating in the program. H.R. 2807, the Small Business Leg-Up Act of 2011, would have transferred any unobligated and repaid funds from the SBLF to the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund ""to increase the availability of credit for small businesses."" H.R. 3147, the Small Business Lending Extension Act, would have extended the Department of the Treasury\'s investment authority from one year to two years. During the 113th Congress, H.R. 2474, the Community Lending and Small Business Jobs Act of 2013, would have transferred any unobligated and repaid funds from the SBLF to the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund.']","11426","gov_report","en","None","717196b201b32c40650297b1168ac3e629cdae29538b8cd4","Summary:","gov_report","532","\n\nThe Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) was established in the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 to address the ongoing effects of the financial crisis on small businesses.

Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nThis report presents background information and issues for Congress concerning the Navy's force structure and shipbuilding plans. The current and planned size and composition of the Navy, the rate of Navy ship procurement, and the prospective affordability of the Navy's shipbuilding plans have been oversight matters for the congressional defense committees for many years. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests funding for the procurement of 12 new ships, including one Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) class aircraft carrier, three Virginia-class attack submarines, three DDG-51 class Aegis destroyers, one FFG(X) frigate, two John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers, and two TATS towing, salvage, and rescue ships. The issue for Congress is whether to approve, reject, or modify the Navy's proposed FY2020 shipbuilding program and the Navy's longer-term shipbuilding plans. Decisions that Congress makes on this issue can substantially affect Navy capabilities and funding requirements, and the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base.

CRS Report R43546, Navy John Lewis (TAO-205) Class Oiler Shipbuilding Program: Background and Issues for Congress , by Ronald O'Rourke. For a discussion of the strategic and budgetary context in which U.S. Navy force structure and shipbuilding plans may be considered, see Appendix A . On December 15, 2016, the Navy released a force-structure goal that calls for achieving and maintaining a fleet of 355 ships of certain types and numbers. The 355-ship force-level goal replaced a 308-ship force-level goal that the Navy released in March 2015. The 355-ship force-level goal is the largest force-level goal that the Navy has released since a 375-ship force-level goal that was in place in 2002-2004. In the years between that 375-ship goal and the 355-ship goal, Navy force-level goals were generally in the low 300s (see Appendix B ). The force level of 355 ships is a goal to be attained in the future; the actual size of the Navy in recent years has generally been between 270 and 290 ships. Table 1 shows the composition of the 355-ship force-level objective. The 355-ship force-level goal is the result of a Force Structure Assessment (FSA) conducted by the Navy in 2016. An FSA is an analysis in which the Navy solicits inputs from U.S. regional combatant commanders (CCDRs) regarding the types and amounts of Navy capabilities that CCDRs deem necessary for implementing the Navy's portion of the national military strategy and then translates those CCDR inputs into required numbers of ships, using current and projected Navy ship types. The analysis takes into account Navy capabilities for both warfighting and day-to-day forward-deployed presence. Although the result of the FSA is often reduced for convenience to single number (e.g., 355 ships), FSAs take into account a number of factors, including types and capabilities of Navy ships, aircraft, unmanned vehicles, and weapons, as well as ship homeporting arrangements and operational cycles. The Navy conducts a new FSA or an update to the existing FSA every few years, as circumstances require, to determine its force-structure goal. Section 1025 of the FY2018 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA ( H.R. 2810 / P.L. 115-91 of December 12, 2017), states the following: SEC. 1025. Policy of the United States on minimum number of battle force ships. (a) Policy.—It shall be the policy of the United States to have available, as soon as practicable, not fewer than 355 battle force ships, comprised of the optimal mix of platforms, with funding subject to the availability of appropriations or other funds. (b) Battle force ships defined.—In this section, the term ""battle force ship"" has the meaning given the term in Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5030.8C. The term battle force ships in the above provision refers to the ships that count toward the quoted size of the Navy in public policy discussions about the Navy. The Navy states that a new FSA is now underway as the successor to the 2016 FSA, and that this new FSA is to be completed by the end of 2019. The new FSA, Navy officials state, will take into account the Trump Administration's December 2017 National Security Strategy document and its January 2018 National Defense Strategy document, both of which put an emphasis on renewed great power competition with China and Russia, as well as updated information on Chinese and Russian naval and other military capabilities and recent developments in new technologies, including those related to unmanned vehicles (UVs). Navy officials have suggested in their public remarks that this new FSA could change the 355-ship figure, the planned mix of ships, or both. Some observers, viewing statements by Navy officials, believe the new FSA in particular might shift the Navy's surface force to a more distributed architecture that includes a reduced proportion of large surface combatants (i.e., cruisers and destroyers), an increased proportion of small surface combatants (i.e., frigates and LCSs), and a newly created third tier of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). Some observers believe the new FSA might also change the Navy's undersea force to a more distributed architecture that includes, in addition to attack submarines (SSNs) and bottom-based sensors, a new element of extremely large unmanned underwater vehicles (XLUUVs), which might be thought of as unmanned submarines. In presenting its proposed FY2020 budget, the Navy highlighted its plans for developing and procuring USVs and UUVs in coming years. Shifting to a more distributed force architecture, Navy officials have suggested, could be appropriate for implementing the Navy's new overarching operational concept, called Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO). Observers view DMO as a response to both China's improving maritime anti-access/area denial capabilities (which include advanced weapons for attacking Navy surface ships) and opportunities created by new technologies, including technologies for UVs and for networking Navy ships, aircraft, unmanned vehicles, and sensors into distributed battle networks. Figure 1 shows a Navy briefing slide depicting the Navy's potential new surface force architecture, with each sphere representing a manned ship or a USV. Consistent with Figure 1 , the Navy's 355-ship goal, reflecting the current force architecture, calls for a Navy with twice as many large surface combatants as small surface combatants. Figure 1 suggests that the potential new surface force architecture could lead to the obverse—a planned force mix that calls for twice as many small surface combatants than large surface combatants—along with a new third tier of numerous USVs. Observers believe the new FSA might additionally change the top-level metric used to express the Navy's force-level goal or the method used to count the size of the Navy, or both, to include large USVs and large UUVs. Table 2 shows the Navy's FY2020 five-year (FY2020-FY2024) shipbuilding plan. The table also shows, for reference purposes, the ships funded for procurement in FY2019. The figures in the table reflect a Navy decision to show the aircraft carrier CVN-81 as a ship to be procured in FY2020 rather than a ship that was procured in FY2019. Congress, as part of its action on the Navy's proposed FY2019 budget, authorized the procurement of CVN-81 in FY2019. As shown in Table 2 , the Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests funding for the procurement of 12 new ships, including one Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) class aircraft carrier, three Virginia-class attack submarines, three DDG-51 class Aegis destroyers, one FFG(X) frigate, two John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers, and two TATS towing, salvage, and rescue ships. If the Navy had listed CVN-81 as a ship procured in FY2019 rather than a ship to be procured in FY2020, then the total numbers of ships in FY2019 and FY2020 would be 14 and 11, respectively. As also shown Table 2 , the Navy's FY2020 five-year (FY2020-FY2024) shipbuilding plan includes 55 new ships, or an average of 11 new ships per year. The Navy's FY2019 budget submission also included a total of 55 ships in the period FY2020-FY2024, but the mix of ships making up the total of 55 for these years has been changed under the FY2020 budget submission to include one additional attack submarine, one additional FFG(X) frigate, and two (rather than four) LPD-17 Flight II amphibious ships over the five-year period. The FY2020 submission also makes some changes within the five-year period to annual procurement quantities for DDG-51 destroyers, ESBs, and TAO-205s without changing the five-year totals for these programs. Compared to what was projected for FY2020 itself under the FY2019 budget submission, the FY2020 request accelerates from FY2023 to FY2020 the aircraft carrier CVN-81 (as a result of Congress's action to authorize the ship in FY2019), adds a third attack submarine, accelerates from FY2021 into FY2020 a third DDG-51, defers from FY2020 to FY2021 an LPD-17 Flight II amphibious ship to FY2021, defers from FY2020 to FY2023 an ESB ship, and accelerates from FY2021 to FY2020 a second TAO-205 class oiler. Table 3 shows the Navy's FY2020-FY2049 30-year shipbuilding plan. In devising a 30-year shipbuilding plan to move the Navy toward its ship force-structure goal, key assumptions and planning factors include but are not limited to ship construction times and service lives, estimated ship procurement costs, projected shipbuilding funding levels, and industrial-base considerations. As shown in Table 3 , the Navy's FY2020 30-year shipbuilding plan includes 304 new ships, or an average of about 10 per year. Table 4 shows the Navy's projection of ship force levels for FY2020-FY2049 that would result from implementing the FY2020 30-year (FY2020-FY2049) 30-year shipbuilding plan shown in Table 3 . As shown in Table 4 , if the FY2020 30-year shipbuilding plan is implemented, the Navy projects that it will achieve a total of 355 ships by FY2034. This is about 20 years sooner than projected under the Navy's FY2019 30-year shipbuilding plan. This is not primarily because the FY2020 30-year plan includes more ships than did the FY2019 plan: The total of 304 ships in the FY2020 plan is only three ships higher than the total of 301 ships in the FY2019 plan. Instead, it is primarily due to a decision announced by the Navy in April 2018, after the FY2019 budget was submitted, to increase the service lives of all DDG-51 destroyers—both those existing and those to be built in the future—to 45 years. Prior to this decision, the Navy had planned to keep older DDG-51s (referred to as the Flight I/II DDG-51s) in service for 35 years and newer DDG-51s (the Flight II/III DDG-51s) for 40 years. Figure 2 shows the Navy's projections for the total number of ships in the Navy under the Navy's FY2019 and FY2020 budget submissions. As can be seen in the figure, the Navy projected under the FY2019 plan that the fleet would not reach a total of 355 ships any time during the 30-year period. The projected number of aircraft carriers in Table 4 , the projected total number of all ships in Table 4 , and the line showing the total number of ships under the Navy's FY2020 budget submission in Figure 2 all reflect the Navy's proposal, under its FY2020 budget submission, to not fund the mid-life nuclear refueling overhaul (called a refueling complex overhaul, or RCOH) of the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman (CVN-75), and to instead retire CVN-75 around FY2024. On April 30, 2019, however, the Administration announced that it was withdrawing this proposal from the Navy's FY2020 budget submission. The Administration now supports funding the CVN-75 RCOH and keeping CVN-75 in service past FY2024. As a result of the withdrawal of its proposal regarding the CVN-75 RCOH, the projected number of aircraft carriers and consequently the projected total number of all ships are now one ship higher for the period FY2022-FY2047 than what is shown in Table 4 , and the line in Figure 2 would be adjusted upward by one ship for those years. (The figures in Table 4 are left unchanged from what is shown in the FY2020 budget submission so as to accurately reflect what is shown in that budget submission.) As shown in Table 4 , although the Navy projects that the fleet will reach a total of 355 ships in FY2034, the Navy in that year and subsequent years will not match the composition called for in the FY2016 FSA. Among other things, the Navy will have more than the required number of large surface combatants (i.e., cruisers and destroyers) from FY2030 through FY2040 (a consequence of the decision to extend the service lives of DDG-51s to 45 years), fewer than the required number of aircraft carriers through the end of the 30-year period, fewer than the required number of attack submarines through FY2047, and fewer than the required number of amphibious ships through the end of the 30-year period. The Navy acknowledges that the mix of ships will not match that called for by the 2016 FSA but states that if the Navy is going to have too many ships of a certain kind, DDG-51s are not a bad type of ship to have too many of, because they are very capable multi-mission ships. One issue for Congress is whether the new FSA that the Navy is conducting will change the 355-ship force-level objective established by the 2016 FSA and, if so, in what ways. As discussed earlier, Navy officials have suggested in their public remarks that this new FSA could shift the Navy toward a more distributed force architecture, which could change the 355-ship figure, the planned mix of ships, or both. The issue for Congress is how to assess the appropriateness of the Navy's FY2020 shipbuilding plans when a key measuring stick for conducting that assessment—the Navy's force-level goal and planned force mix—might soon change. Another oversight issue for Congress concerns the prospective affordability of the Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan. This issue has been a matter of oversight focus for several years, and particularly since the enactment in 2011 of the Budget Control Act, or BCA ( S. 365 / P.L. 112-25 of August 2, 2011). Observers have been particularly concerned about the plan's prospective affordability during the decade or so from the mid-2020s through the mid-2030s, when the plan calls for procuring Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines as well as replacements for large numbers of retiring attack submarines, cruisers, and destroyers. Figure 3 shows, in a graphic form, the Navy's estimate of the annual amounts of funding that would be needed to implement the Navy's FY2020 30-year shipbuilding plan. The figure shows that during the period from the mid-2020s through the mid-2030s, the Navy estimates that implementing the FY2020 30-year shipbuilding plan would require roughly $24 billion per year in shipbuilding funds. As discussed in the CRS report on the Columbia-class program, the Navy since 2013 has identified the Columbia-class program as its top program priority, meaning that it is the Navy's intention to fully fund this program, if necessary at the expense of other Navy programs, including other Navy shipbuilding programs. This led to concerns that in a situation of finite Navy shipbuilding budgets, funding requirements for the Columbia-class program could crowd out funding for procuring other types of Navy ships. These concerns in turn led to the creation by Congress of the National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund (NSBDF), a fund in the DOD budget that is intended in part to encourage policymakers to identify funding for the Columbia-class program from sources across the entire DOD budget rather than from inside the Navy's budget alone. Several years ago, when concerns arose about the potential impact of the Columbia-class program on funding available for other Navy shipbuilding programs, the Navy's shipbuilding budget was roughly $14 billion per year, and the roughly $7 billion per year that the Columbia-class program is projected to require from the mid-2020s to the mid-2030s (see Figure 3 ) represented roughly one-half of that total. With the Navy's shipbuilding budget having grown in more recent years to a total of roughly $24 billion per year, the $7 billion per year projected to be required by the Columbia-class program during those years does not loom proportionately as large as it once did in the Navy's shipbuilding budget picture. Even so, some concerns remain regarding the potential impact of the Columbia-class program on funding available for other Navy shipbuilding programs. If one or more Navy ship designs turn out to be more expensive to build than the Navy estimates, then the projected funding levels shown in Figure 3 would not be sufficient to procure all the ships shown in the 30-year shipbuilding plan. As detailed by CBO and GAO, lead ships in Navy shipbuilding programs in many cases have turned out to be more expensive to build than the Navy had estimated. Ship designs that can be viewed as posing a risk of being more expensive to build than the Navy estimates include Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) class aircraft carriers, Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines, Virginia-class attack submarines equipped with the Virginia Payload Module (VPM), Flight III versions of the DDG-51 destroyer, FFG(X) frigates, LPD-17 Flight II amphibious ships, and John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers, as well as other new classes of ships that the Navy wants to begin procuring years from now. The statute that requires the Navy to submit a 30-year shipbuilding plan each year (10 U.S.C. 231) also requires CBO to submit its own independent analysis of the potential cost of the 30-year plan (10 U.S.C. 231[d]). CBO is now preparing its estimate of the cost of the Navy's FY2020 30-year shipbuilding plan. In the meantime, Figure 4 shows, in a graphic form, CBO's estimate of the annual amounts of funding that would be needed to implement the Navy's FY2019 30-year shipbuilding plan. This figure might be compared to the Navy's estimate of its FY2020 30-year plan as shown in Figure 3 , although doing so poses some apples-vs.-oranges issues, as the Navy's FY2019 and FY2020 30-year plans do not cover exactly the same 30-year periods, and for the years they do have in common, there are some differences in types and numbers of ships to be procured in certain years. CBO analyses of past Navy 30-year shipbuilding plans have generally estimated the cost of implementing those plans to be higher than what the Navy estimated. Consistent with that past pattern, as shown in Table 5 , CBO's estimate of the cost to implement the Navy's FY2019 30-year (FY2019-FY2048) shipbuilding plan is about 27% higher than the Navy's estimated cost for the FY2019 plan. ( Table 5 does not pose an apples-vs.-oranges issue, because both the Navy and CBO estimates in this table are for the Navy's FY2019 30-year plan.) More specifically, as shown in the table, CBO estimated that the cost of the first 10 years of the FY2019 30-year plan would be about 2% higher than the Navy's estimate; that the cost of the middle 10 years of the plan would be about 13% higher than the Navy's estimate; and that the cost of the final 10 years of the plan would be about 27% higher than the Navy's estimate. The growing divergence between CBO's estimate and the Navy's estimate as one moves from the first 10 years of the 30-year plan to the final 10 years of the plan is due in part to a technical difference between CBO and the Navy regarding the treatment of inflation. This difference compounds over time, making it increasingly important as a factor in the difference between CBO's estimates and the Navy's estimates the further one goes into the 30-year period. In other words, other things held equal, this factor tends to push the CBO and Navy estimates further apart as one proceeds from the earlier years of the plan to the later years of the plan. The growing divergence between CBO's estimate and the Navy's estimate as one moves from the first 10 years of the 30-year plan to the final 10 years of the plan is also due to differences between CBO and the Navy about the costs of certain ship classes, particularly classes that are projected to be procured starting years from now. The designs of these future ship classes are not yet determined, creating more potential for CBO and the Navy to come to differing conclusions regarding their potential cost. For the FY2019 30-year plan, the largest source of difference between CBO and the Navy regarding the costs of individual ship classes was a new class of SSNs that the Navy wants to begin procuring in FY2034 as the successor to the Virginia-class SSN design. This new class of SSN, CBO says, accounted for 42% of the difference between the CBO and Navy estimates for the FY2019 30-year plan, in part because there were a substantial number of these SSNs in the plan, and because those ships occur in the latter years of the plan, where the effects of the technical difference between CBO and the Navy regarding the treatment of inflation show more strongly. The second-largest source of difference between CBO and the Navy regarding the costs of individual ship classes was a new class of large surface combatant (i.e., cruiser or destroyer) that the Navy wants to begin procuring in the future, which accounted for 20% of the difference, for reasons that are similar to those mentioned above for the new class of SSNs. The third-largest source of difference was the new class of frigates (FFG[X]s) that the Navy wants to begin procuring in FY2020, which accounts for 9% of the difference. The remaining 29% of difference between the CBO and Navy estimates was accounted for collectively by several other shipbuilding programs, each of which individually accounts for between 1% and 4% of the difference. The Columbia-class program, which accounted for 4%, is one of the programs in this final group. Detailed coverage of legislative activity on certain Navy shipbuilding programs (including funding levels, legislative provisions, and report language) can be found in the following CRS reports: CRS Report R41129, Navy Columbia (SSBN-826) Class Ballistic Missile Submarine Program: Background and Issues for Congress , by Ronald O'Rourke.

CRS Report R43546, Navy John Lewis (TAO-205) Class Oiler Shipbuilding Program: Background and Issues for Congress , by Ronald O'Rourke. Legislative activity on individual Navy shipbuilding programs that are not covered in detail in the above reports is covered below. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests funding for the procurement of 12 new ships: 1 Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) class aircraft carrier; 3 Virginia-class attack submarines; 3 DDG-51 class Aegis destroyers; 1 FFG(X) frigate; 2 John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers; and 2 TATS towing, salvage, and rescue ships. As noted earlier, the above list of 12 ships reflects a Navy decision to show the aircraft carrier CVN-81 as a ship to be procured in FY2020 rather than a ship that was procured in FY2019. Congress, as part of its action on the Navy's proposed FY2019 budget, authorized the procurement of CVN-81 in FY2019. The Navy's proposed FY2020 shipbuilding budget also requests funding for ships that have been procured in prior fiscal years, and ships that are to be procured in future fiscal years, as well as funding for activities other than the building of new Navy ships. Table 6 summarizes congressional action on the Navy's FY2020 funding request for Navy shipbuilding. The table shows the amounts requested and congressional changes to those requested amounts. A blank cell in a filled-in column showing congressional changes to requested amounts indicates no change from the requested amount. Appendix A. Strategic and Budgetary Context This appendix presents some brief comments on elements of the strategic and budgetary context in which U.S. Navy force structure and shipbuilding plans may be considered. Shift in International Security Environment World events have led some observers, starting in late 2013, to conclude that the international security environment has undergone a shift over the past several years from the familiar post-Cold War era of the past 20-25 years, also sometimes known as the unipolar moment (with the United States as the unipolar power), to a new and different strategic situation that features, among other things, renewed great power competition with China and Russia, and challenges to elements of the U.S.-led international order that has operated since World War II. This situation is discussed further in another CRS report. World Geography and U.S. Grand Strategy Discussion of the above-mentioned shift in the international security environment has led to a renewed emphasis in discussions of U.S. security and foreign policy on grand strategy and geopolitics. From a U.S. perspective on grand strategy and geopolitics, it can be noted that most of the world's people, resources, and economic activity are located not in the Western Hemisphere, but in the other hemisphere, particularly Eurasia. In response to this basic feature of world geography, U.S. policymakers for the past several decades have chosen to pursue, as a key element of U.S. national strategy, a goal of preventing the emergence of a regional hegemon in one part of Eurasia or another, on the grounds that such a hegemon could represent a concentration of power strong enough to threaten core U.S. interests by, for example, denying the United States access to some of the other hemisphere's resources and economic activity. Although U.S. policymakers have not often stated this key national strategic goal explicitly in public, U.S. military (and diplomatic) operations in recent decades—both wartime operations and day-to-day operations—can be viewed as having been carried out in no small part in support of this key goal. U.S. Grand Strategy and U.S. Naval Forces As noted above, in response to basic world geography, U.S. policymakers for the past several decades have chosen to pursue, as a key element of U.S. national strategy, a goal of preventing the emergence of a regional hegemon in one part of Eurasia or another. The traditional U.S. goal of preventing the emergence of a regional hegemon in one part of Eurasia or another has been a major reason why the U.S. military is structured with force elements that enable it to cross broad expanses of ocean and air space and then conduct sustained, large-scale military operations upon arrival. Force elements associated with this goal include, among other things, an Air Force with significant numbers of long-range bombers, long-range surveillance aircraft, long-range airlift aircraft, and aerial refueling tankers, and a Navy with significant numbers of aircraft carriers, nuclear-powered attack submarines, large surface combatants, large amphibious ships, and underway replenishment ships. The United States is the only country in the world that has designed its military to cross broad expanses of ocean and air space and then conduct sustained, large-scale military operations upon arrival. The other countries in the Western Hemisphere do not design their forces to do this because they cannot afford to, and because the United States has been, in effect, doing it for them. Countries in the other hemisphere do not design their forces to do this for the very basic reason that they are already in the other hemisphere, and consequently instead spend their defense money on forces that are tailored largely for influencing events in their own local region. The fact that the United States has designed its military to do something that other countries do not design their forces to do—cross broad expanses of ocean and air space and then conduct sustained, large-scale military operations upon arrival—can be important to keep in mind when comparing the U.S. military to the militaries of other nations. For example, in observing that the U.S. Navy has 11 aircraft carriers while other countries have no more than one or two, it can be noted other countries do not need a significant number of aircraft carriers because, unlike the United States, they are not designing their forces to cross broad expanses of ocean and air space and then conduct sustained, large-scale military operations upon arrival. As another example, it is sometimes noted, in assessing the adequacy of U.S. naval forces, that U.S. naval forces are equal in tonnage to the next dozen or more navies combined, and that most of those next dozen or more navies are the navies of U.S. allies. Those other fleets, however, are mostly of Eurasian countries, which do not design their forces to cross to the other side of the world and then conduct sustained, large-scale military operations upon arrival. The fact that the U.S. Navy is much bigger than allied navies does not necessarily prove that U.S. naval forces are either sufficient or excessive; it simply reflects the differing and generally more limited needs that U.S. allies have for naval forces. (It might also reflect an underinvestment by some of those allies to meet even their more limited naval needs.) Countries have differing needs for naval and other military forces. The United States, as a country located in the Western Hemisphere that has adopted a goal of preventing the emergence of a regional hegemon in one part of Eurasia or another, has defined a need for naval and other military forces that is quite different from the needs of allies that are located in Eurasia. The sufficiency of U.S. naval and other military forces consequently is best assessed not through comparison to the militaries of other countries, but against U.S. strategic goals. More generally, from a geopolitical perspective, it can be noted that that U.S. naval forces, while not inexpensive, give the United States the ability to convert the world's oceans—a global commons that covers more than two-thirds of the planet's surface—into a medium of maneuver and operations for projecting U.S. power ashore and otherwise defending U.S. interests around the world. The ability to use the world's oceans in this manner—and to deny other countries the use of the world's oceans for taking actions against U.S. interests—constitutes an immense asymmetric advantage for the United States. This point would be less important if less of the world were covered by water, or if the oceans were carved into territorial blocks, like the land. Most of the world, however, is covered by water, and most of those waters are international waters, where naval forces can operate freely. The point, consequently, is not that U.S. naval forces are intrinsically special or privileged—it is that they have a certain value simply as a consequence of the physical and legal organization of the planet. Uncertainty Regarding Future U.S. Role in the World The overall U.S. role in the world since the end of World War II in 1945 (i.e., over the past 70 years) is generally described as one of global leadership and significant engagement in international affairs. A key aim of that role has been to promote and defend the open international order that the United States, with the support of its allies, created in the years after World War II. In addition to promoting and defending the open international order, the overall U.S. role is generally described as having been one of promoting freedom, democracy, and human rights, while criticizing and resisting authoritarianism where possible, and opposing the emergence of regional hegemons in Eurasia or a spheres-of-influence world. Certain statements and actions from the Trump Administration have led to uncertainty about the Administration's intentions regarding the U.S. role in the world. Based on those statements and actions, some observers have speculated that the Trump Administration may want to change the U.S. role in one or more ways. A change in the overall U.S. role could have profound implications for DOD strategy, budgets, plans, and programs, including the planned size and structure of the Navy. Declining U.S. Technological and Qualitative Edge DOD officials have expressed concern that the technological and qualitative edge that U.S. military forces have had relative to the military forces of other countries is being narrowed by improving military capabilities in other countries. China's improving military capabilities are a primary contributor to that concern. Russia's rejuvenated military capabilities are an additional contributor. DOD in recent years has taken a number of actions to arrest and reverse the decline in the U.S. technological and qualitative edge. Challenge to U.S. Sea Control and U.S. Position in Western Pacific Observers of Chinese and U.S. military forces view China's improving naval capabilities as posing a potential challenge in the Western Pacific to the U.S. Navy's ability to achieve and maintain control of blue-water ocean areas in wartime—the first such challenge the U.S. Navy has faced since the end of the Cold War. More broadly, these observers view China's naval capabilities as a key element of an emerging broader Chinese military challenge to the long-standing status of the United States as the leading military power in the Western Pacific. Longer Ship Deployments U.S. Navy officials have testified that fully meeting requests from U.S. regional combatant commanders (CCDRs) for forward-deployed U.S. naval forces would require a Navy much larger than today's fleet. For example, Navy officials testified in March 2014 that a Navy of 450 ships would be required to fully meet CCDR requests for forward-deployed Navy forces. CCDR requests for forward-deployed U.S. Navy forces are adjudicated by DOD through a process called the Global Force Management Allocation Plan. The process essentially makes choices about how best to apportion a finite number forward-deployed U.S. Navy ships among competing CCDR requests for those ships. Even with this process, the Navy has lengthened the deployments of some ships in an attempt to meet policymaker demands for forward-deployed U.S. Navy ships. Although Navy officials are aiming to limit ship deployments to seven months, Navy ships in recent years have frequently been deployed for periods of eight months or more. Limits on Defense Spending in Budget Control Act of 2011 as Amended Limits on the ""base"" portion of the U.S. defense budget established by Budget Control Act of 2011, or BCA ( S. 365 / P.L. 112-25 of August 2, 2011), as amended, combined with some of the considerations above, have led to discussions among observers about how to balance competing demands for finite U.S. defense funds, and about whether programs for responding to China's military modernization effort can be adequately funded while also adequately funding other defense-spending priorities, such as initiatives for responding to Russia's actions in Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe and U.S. operations for countering the Islamic State organization in the Middle East. Appendix B. Earlier Navy Force-Structure Goals Dating Back to 2001 The table below shows earlier Navy force-structure goals dating back to 2001. The 308-ship force-level goal of March 2015, shown in the first column of the table, is the goal that was replaced by the 355-ship force-level goal released in December 2016. Appendix C. Comparing Past Ship Force Levels to Current or Potential Future Ship Force Levels In assessing the appropriateness of the current or potential future number of ships in the Navy, observers sometimes compare that number to historical figures for total Navy fleet size. Historical figures for total fleet size, however, can be a problematic yardstick for assessing the appropriateness of the current or potential future number of ships in the Navy, particularly if the historical figures are more than a few years old, because the missions to be performed by the Navy, the mix of ships that make up the Navy, and the technologies that are available to Navy ships for performing missions all change over time; and the number of ships in the fleet in an earlier year might itself have been inappropriate (i.e., not enough or more than enough) for meeting the Navy's mission requirements in that year. Regarding the first bullet point above, the Navy, for example, reached a late-Cold War peak of 568 battle force ships at the end of FY1987, and as of May 7, 2019, included a total of 289 battle force ships. The FY1987 fleet, however, was intended to meet a set of mission requirements that focused on countering Soviet naval forces at sea during a potential multitheater NATO-Warsaw Pact conflict, while the May 2019 fleet is intended to meet a considerably different set of mission requirements centered on influencing events ashore by countering both land- and sea-based military forces of China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran, as well as nonstate terrorist organizations. In addition, the Navy of FY1987 differed substantially from the May 2019 fleet in areas such as profusion of precision-guided air-delivered weapons, numbers of Tomahawk-capable ships, and the sophistication of C4ISR systems and networking capabilities. In coming years, Navy missions may shift again, and the capabilities of Navy ships will likely have changed further by that time due to developments such as more comprehensive implementation of networking technology, increased use of ship-based unmanned vehicles, and the potential fielding of new types of weapons such as lasers or electromagnetic rail guns. The 568-ship fleet of FY1987 may or may not have been capable of performing its stated missions; the 289-ship fleet of May 2019 may or may not be capable of performing its stated missions; and a fleet years from now with a certain number of ships may or may not be capable of performing its stated missions. Given changes over time in mission requirements, ship mixes, and technologies, however, these three issues are to a substantial degree independent of one another. For similar reasons, trends over time in the total number of ships in the Navy are not necessarily a reliable indicator of the direction of change in the fleet's ability to perform its stated missions. An increasing number of ships in the fleet might not necessarily mean that the fleet's ability to perform its stated missions is increasing, because the fleet's mission requirements might be increasing more rapidly than ship numbers and average ship capability. Similarly, a decreasing number of ships in the fleet might not necessarily mean that the fleet's ability to perform stated missions is decreasing, because the fleet's mission requirements might be declining more rapidly than numbers of ships, or because average ship capability and the percentage of time that ships are in deployed locations might be increasing quickly enough to more than offset reductions in total ship numbers. Regarding the second of the two bullet points above, it can be noted that comparisons of the size of the fleet today with the size of the fleet in earlier years rarely appear to consider whether the fleet was appropriately sized in those earlier years (and therefore potentially suitable as a yardstick of comparison), even though it is quite possible that the fleet in those earlier years might not have been appropriately sized, and even though there might have been differences of opinion among observers at that time regarding that question. Just as it might not be prudent for observers years from now to tacitly assume that the 286-ship Navy of September 2018 was appropriately sized for meeting the mission requirements of 2018, even though there were differences of opinion among observers on that question, simply because a figure of 286 ships appears in the historical records for 2016, so, too, might it not be prudent for observers today to tacitly assume that the number of ships of the Navy in an earlier year was appropriate for meeting the Navy's mission requirements that year, even though there might have been differences of opinion among observers at that time regarding that question, simply because the size of the Navy in that year appears in a table like Table H-1 . Previous Navy force structure plans, such as those shown in Table B-1 , might provide some insight into the potential adequacy of a proposed new force-structure plan, but changes over time in mission requirements, technologies available to ships for performing missions, and other force-planning factors, as well as the possibility that earlier force-structure plans might not have been appropriate for meeting the mission demands of their times, suggest that some caution should be applied in using past force structure plans for this purpose, particularly if those past force structure plans are more than a few years old. The Reagan-era goal for a 600-ship Navy, for example, was designed for a Cold War set of missions focusing on countering Soviet naval forces at sea, which is not an appropriate basis for planning the Navy today, and there was considerable debate during those years as to the appropriateness of the 600-ship goal. Appendix D. Industrial Base Ability for, and Employment Impact of, Additional Shipbuilding Work This appendix presents background information on the ability of the industrial base to take on the additional shipbuilding work associated with achieving and maintaining the Navy's 355-ship force-level goal and on the employment impact of additional shipbuilding work. Industrial Base Ability The U.S. shipbuilding industrial base has some unused capacity to take on increased Navy shipbuilding work, particularly for certain kinds of surface ships, and its capacity could be increased further over time to support higher Navy shipbuilding rates. Navy shipbuilding rates could not be increased steeply across the board overnight—time (and investment) would be needed to hire and train additional workers and increase production facilities at shipyards and supplier firms, particularly for supporting higher rates of submarine production. Depending on their specialties, newly hired workers could be initially less productive per unit of time worked than more experienced workers. Some parts of the shipbuilding industrial base, such as the submarine construction industrial base, could face more challenges than others in ramping up to the higher production rates required to build the various parts of the 355-ship fleet. Over a period of a few to several years, with investment and management attention, Navy shipbuilding could ramp up to higher rates for achieving a 355-ship fleet over a period of 20-30 years. An April 2017 CBO report stated that all seven shipyards [currently involved in building the Navy's major ships] would need to increase their workforces and several would need to make improvements to their infrastructure in order to build ships at a faster rate. However, certain sectors face greater obstacles in constructing ships at faster rates than others: Building more submarines to meet the goals of the 2016 force structure assessment would pose the greatest challenge to the shipbuilding industry. Increasing the number of aircraft carriers and surface combatants would pose a small to moderate challenge to builders of those vessels. Finally, building more amphibious ships and combat logistics and support ships would be the least problematic for the shipyards. The workforces across those yards would need to increase by about 40 percent over the next 5 to 10 years. Managing the growth and training of those new workforces while maintaining the current standard of quality and efficiency would represent the most significant industrywide challenge. In addition, industry and Navy sources indicate that as much as $4 billion would need to be invested in the physical infrastructure of the shipyards to achieve the higher production rates required under the [notional] 15-year and 20-year [buildup scenarios examined by CBO]. Less investment would be needed for the [notional] 25-year or 30-year [buildup scenarios examined by CBO]. A January 13, 2017, press report states the following: The Navy's production lines are hot and the work to prepare them for the possibility of building out a much larger fleet would be manageable, the service's head of acquisition said Thursday. From a logistics perspective, building the fleet from its current 274 ships to 355, as recommended in the Navy's newest force structure assessment in December, would be straightforward, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition Sean Stackley told reporters at the Surface Navy Association's annual symposium. ""By virtue of maintaining these hot production lines, frankly, over the last eight years, our facilities are in pretty good shape,"" Stackley said. ""In fact, if you talked to industry, they would say we're underutilizing the facilities that we have."" The areas where the Navy would likely have to adjust ""tooling"" to answer demand for a larger fleet would likely be in Virginia-class attack submarines and large surface combatants, the DDG-51 guided missile destroyers—two ship classes likely to surge if the Navy gets funding to build to 355 ships, he said. ""Industry's going to have to go out and procure special tooling associated with going from current production rates to a higher rate, but I would say that's easily done,"" he said. Another key, Stackley said, is maintaining skilled workers—both the builders in the yards and the critical supply-chain vendors who provide major equipment needed for ship construction. And, he suggested, it would help to avoid budget cuts and other events that would force workforce layoffs. ""We're already prepared to ramp up,"" he said. ""In certain cases, that means not laying off the skilled workforce we want to retain."" A January 17, 2017, press report states the following: Building stable designs with active production lines is central to the Navy's plan to grow to 355 ships. ""if you look at the 355-ship number, and you study the ship classes (desired), the big surge is in attack submarines and large surface combatants, which today are DDG-51 (destroyers),"" the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Sean Stackley, told reporters at last week's Surface Navy Association conference. Those programs have proven themselves reliable performers both at sea and in the shipyards. From today's fleet of 274 ships, ""we're on an irreversible path to 308 by 2021. Those ships are already in construction,"" said Stackley. ""To go from there to 355, virtually all those ships are currently in production, with some exceptions: Ohio Replacement, (we) just got done the Milestone B there (to move from R&D into detailed design); and then upgrades to existing platforms. So we have hot production lines that will take us to that 355-ship Navy."" A January 24, 2017, press report states the following: Navy officials say a recently determined plan to increase its fleet size by adding more new submarines, carriers and destroyers is ""executable"" and that early conceptual work toward this end is already underway.... Although various benchmarks will need to be reached in order for this new plan to come to fruition, such as Congressional budget allocations, Navy officials do tell Scout Warrior that the service is already working—at least in concept—on plans to vastly enlarge the fleet. Findings from this study are expected to inform an upcoming 2018 Navy Shipbuilding Plan, service officials said. A January 12, 2017, press report states the following: Brian Cuccias, president of Ingalls Shipbuilding [a shipyard owned by Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) that builds Navy destroyers and amphibious ships as well as Coast Guard cutters], said Ingalls, which is currently building 10 ships for four Navy and Coast Guard programs at its 800-acre facility in Pascagoula, Miss., could build more because it is using only 70 to 75 percent of its capacity. A March 2017 press report states the following: As the Navy calls for a larger fleet, shipbuilders are looking toward new contracts and ramping up their yards to full capacity.... The Navy is confident that U.S. shipbuilders will be able to meet an increased demand, said Ray Mabus, then-secretary of the Navy, during a speech at the Surface Navy Association's annual conference in Arlington, Virginia. They have the capacity to ""get there because of the ships we are building today,"" Mabus said. ""I don't think we could have seven years ago."" Shipbuilders around the United States have ""hot"" production lines and are manufacturing vessels on multi-year or block buy contracts, he added. The yards have made investments in infrastructure and in the training of their workers. ""We now have the basis ... [to] get to that much larger fleet,"" he said.... Shipbuilders have said they are prepared for more work. At Ingalls Shipbuilding—a subsidiary of Huntington Ingalls Industries—10 ships are under construction at its Pascagoula, Mississippi, yard, but it is under capacity, said Brian Cuccias, the company's president. The shipbuilder is currently constructing five guided-missile destroyers, the latest San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock ship, and two national security cutters for the Coast Guard. ""Ingalls is a very successful production line right now, but it has the ability to actually produce a lot more in the future,"" he said during a briefing with reporters in January. The company's facility is currently operating at 75 percent capacity, he noted.... Austal USA—the builder of the Independence-variant of the littoral combat ship and the expeditionary fast transport vessel—is also ready to increase its capacity should the Navy require it, said Craig Perciavalle, the company's president. The latest discussions are ""certainly something that a shipbuilder wants to hear,"" he said. ""We do have the capability of increasing throughput if the need and demand were to arise, and then we also have the ability with the present workforce and facility to meet a different mix that could arise as well."" Austal could build fewer expeditionary fast transport vessels and more littoral combat ships, or vice versa, he added. ""The key thing for us is to keep the manufacturing lines hot and really leverage the momentum that we've gained on both of the programs,"" he said. The company—which has a 164-acre yard in Mobile, Alabama—is focused on the extension of the LCS and expeditionary fast transport ship program, but Perciavalle noted that it could look into manufacturing other types of vessels. ""We do have excess capacity to even build smaller vessels … if that opportunity were to arise and we're pursuing that,"" he said. Bryan Clark, a naval analyst at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, said shipbuilders are on average running between 70 and 80 percent capacity. While they may be ready to meet an increased demand for ships, it would take time to ramp up their workforces. However, the bigger challenge is the supplier industrial base, he said. ""Shipyards may be able to build ships but the supplier base that builds the pumps … and the radars and the radios and all those other things, they don't necessarily have that ability to ramp up,"" he said. ""You would need to put some money into building up their capacity."" That has to happen now, he added. Rear Adm. William Gallinis, program manager for program executive office ships, said what the Navy must be ""mindful of is probably our vendor base that support the shipyards."" Smaller companies that supply power electronics and switchboards could be challenged, he said. ""Do we need to re-sequence some of the funding to provide some of the facility improvements for some of the vendors that may be challenged? My sense is that the industrial base will size to the demand signal. We just need to be mindful of how we transition to that increased demand signal,"" he said. The acquisition workforce may also see an increased amount of stress, Gallinis noted. ""It takes a fair amount of experience and training to get a good contracting officer to the point to be [able to] manage contracts or procure contracts."" ""But I don't see anything that is insurmountable,"" he added. At a May 24, 2017, hearing before the Seapower subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee on the industrial-base aspects of the Navy's 355-ship goal, John P. Casey, executive vice president–marine systems, General Dynamics Corporation (one of the country's two principal builders of Navy ships) stated the following: It is our belief that the Nation's shipbuilding industrial base can scale-up hot production lines for existing ships and mobilize additional resources to accomplish the significant challenge of achieving the 355-ship Navy as quickly as possible.... Supporting a plan to achieve a 355-ship Navy will be the most challenging for the nuclear submarine enterprise. Much of the shipyard and industrial base capacity was eliminated following the steep drop-off in submarine production that occurred with the cancellation of the Seawolf Program in 1992. The entire submarine industrial base at all levels of the supply chain will likely need to recapitalize some portion of its facilities, workforce, and supply chain just to support the current plan to build the Columbia Class SSBN program, while concurrently building Virginia Class SSNs. Additional SSN procurement will require industry to expand its plans and associated investment beyond the level today.... Shipyard labor resources include the skilled trades needed to fabricate, build and outfit major modules, perform assembly, test and launch of submarines, and associated support organizations that include planning, material procurement, inspection, quality assurance, and ship certification. Since there is no commercial equivalency for Naval nuclear submarine shipbuilding, these trade resources cannot be easily acquired in large numbers from other industries. Rather, these shipyard resources must be acquired and developed over time to ensure the unique knowledge and know-how associated with nuclear submarine shipbuilding is passed on to the next generation of shipbuilders. The mechanisms of knowledge transfer require sufficient lead time to create the proficient, skilled craftsmen in each key trade including welding, electrical, machining, shipfitting, pipe welding, painting, and carpentry, which are among the largest trades that would need to grow to support increased demand. These trades will need to be hired in the numbers required to support the increased workload. Both shipyards have scalable processes in place to acquire, train, and develop the skilled workforce they need to build nuclear ships. These processes and associated training facilities need to be expanded to support the increased demand. As with the shipyards, the same limiting factors associated with facilities, workforce, and supply chain also limit the submarine unique first tier suppliers and sub-tiers in the industrial base for which there is no commercial equivalency.... The supply base is the third resource that will need to be expanded to meet the increased demand over the next 20 years. During the OHIO, 688 and SEAWOLF construction programs, there were over 17,000 suppliers supporting submarine construction programs. That resource base was ""rationalized"" during submarine low rate production over the last 20 years. The current submarine industrial base reflects about 5,000 suppliers, of which about 3,000 are currently active (i.e., orders placed within the last 5 years), 80% of which are single or sole source (based on $). It will take roughly 20 years to build the 12 Columbia Class submarines that starts construction in FY21. The shipyards are expanding strategic sourcing of appropriate non-core products (e.g., decks, tanks, etc.) in order to focus on core work at each shipyard facility (e.g., module outfitting and assembly). Strategic sourcing will move demand into the supply base where capacity may exist or where it can be developed more easily. This approach could offer the potential for cost savings by competition or shifting work to lower cost work centers throughout the country. Each shipyard has a process to assess their current supply base capacity and capability and to determine where it would be most advantageous to perform work in the supply base.... Achieving the increased rate of production and reducing the cost of submarines will require the Shipbuilders to rely on the supply base for more non-core products such as structural fabrication, sheet metal, machining, electrical, and standard parts. The supply base must be made ready to execute work with submarine-specific requirements at a rate and volume that they are not currently prepared to perform. Preparing the supply base to execute increased demand requires early non-recurring funding to support cross-program construction readiness and EOQ funding to procure material in a manner that does not hold up existing ship construction schedules should problems arise in supplier qualification programs. This requires longer lead times (estimates of three years to create a new qualified, critical supplier) than the current funding profile supports.... We need to rely on market principles to allow suppliers, the shipyards and GFE material providers to sort through the complicated demand equation across the multiple ship programs. Supplier development funding previously mentioned would support non-recurring efforts which are needed to place increased orders for material in multiple market spaces. Examples would include valves, build-to-print fabrication work, commodities, specialty material, engineering components, etc. We are engaging our marine industry associations to help foster innovative approaches that could reduce costs and gain efficiency for this increased volume.... Supporting the 355-ship Navy will require Industry to add capability and capacity across the entire Navy Shipbuilding value chain. Industry will need to make investment decisions for additional capital spend starting now in order to meet a step change in demand that would begin in FY19 or FY20. For the submarine enterprise, the step change was already envisioned and investment plans that embraced a growth trajectory were already being formulated. Increasing demand by adding additional submarines will require scaling facility and workforce development plans to operate at a higher rate of production. The nuclear shipyards would also look to increase material procurement proportionally to the increased demand. In some cases, the shipyard facilities may be constrained with existing capacity and may look to source additional work in the supply base where capacity exists or where there are competitive business advantages to be realized. Creating additional capacity in the supply base will require non-recurring investment in supplier qualification, facilities, capital equipment and workforce training and development. Industry is more likely to increase investment in new capability and capacity if there is certainty that the Navy will proceed with a stable shipbuilding plan. Positive signals of commitment from the Government must go beyond a published 30-year Navy Shipbuilding Plan and line items in the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) and should include: Multi-year contracting for Block procurement which provides stability in the industrial base and encourages investment in facilities and workforce development Funding for supplier development to support training, qualification, and facilitization efforts—Electric Boat and Newport News have recommended to the Navy funding of $400M over a three-year period starting in 2018 to support supplier development for the Submarine Industrial Base as part of an Integrated Enterprise Plan Extended Enterprise initiative Acceleration of Advance Procurement and/or Economic Order Quantities (EOQ) procurement from FY19 to FY18 for Virginia Block V Government incentives for construction readiness and facilities / special tooling for shipyard and supplier facilities, which help cash flow capital investment ahead of construction contract awards Procurement of additional production back-up (PBU) material to help ensure a ready supply of material to mitigate construction schedule risk.... So far, this testimony has focused on the Submarine Industrial Base, but the General Dynamics Marine Systems portfolio also includes surface ship construction. Unlike Electric Boat, Bath Iron Works and NASSCO are able to support increased demand without a significant increase in resources..... Bath Iron Works is well positioned to support the Administration's announced goal of increasing the size of the Navy fleet to 355 ships. For BIW that would mean increasing the total current procurement rate of two DDG 51s per year to as many as four DDGs per year, allocated equally between BIW and HII. This is the same rate that the surface combatant industrial base sustained over the first decade of full rate production of the DDG 51 Class (1989-1999).... No significant capital investment in new facilities is required to accommodate delivering two DDGs per year. However, additional funding will be required to train future shipbuilders and maintain equipment. Current hiring and training processes support the projected need, and have proven to be successful in the recent past. BIW has invested significantly in its training programs since 2014 with the restart of the DDG 51 program and given these investments and the current market in Maine, there is little concern of meeting the increase in resources required under the projected plans. A predictable and sustainable Navy workload is essential to justify expanding hiring/training programs. BIW would need the Navy's commitment that the Navy's plan will not change before it would proceed with additional hiring and training to support increased production. BIW's supply chain is prepared to support a procurement rate increase of up to four DDG 51s per year for the DDG 51 Program. BIW has long-term purchasing agreements in place for all major equipment and material for the DDG 51 Program. These agreements provide for material lead time and pricing, and are not constrained by the number of ships ordered in a year. BIW confirmed with all of its critical suppliers that they can support this increased procurement rate.... The Navy's Force Structure Assessment calls for three additional ESBs. Additionally, NASSCO has been asked by the Navy and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to evaluate its ability to increase the production rate of T-AOs to two ships per year. NASSCO has the capacity to build three more ESBs at a rate of one ship per year while building two T-AOs per year. The most cost effective funding profile requires funding ESB 6 in FY18 and the following ships in subsequent fiscal years to avoid increased cost resulting from a break in the production line. The most cost effective funding profile to enable a production rate of two T-AO ships per year requires funding an additional long lead time equipment set beginning in FY19 and an additional ship each year beginning in FY20. NASSCO must now reduce its employment levels due to completion of a series of commercial programs which resulted in the delivery of six ships in 2016. The proposed increase in Navy shipbuilding stabilizes NASSCO's workload and workforce to levels that were readily demonstrated over the last several years. Some moderate investment in the NASSCO shipyard will be needed to reach this level of production. The recent CBO report on the costs of building a 355-ship Navy accurately summarized NASSCO's ability to reach the above production rate stating, ""building more … combat logistics and support ships would be the least problematic for the shipyards."" At the same hearing, Brian Cuccias, president, Ingalls Shipbuilding, Huntington Ingalls Industries (the country's other principal builder of Navy ships) stated the following: Qualifying to be a supplier is a difficult process. Depending on the commodity, it may take up to 36 months. That is a big burden on some of these small businesses. This is why creating sufficient volume and exercising early contractual authorization and advance procurement funding is necessary to grow the supplier base, and not just for traditional long-lead time components; that effort needs to expand to critical components and commodities that today are controlling the build rate of submarines and carriers alike. Many of our suppliers are small businesses and can only make decisions to invest in people, plant and tooling when they are awarded a purchase order. We need to consider how we can make commitments to suppliers early enough to ensure material readiness and availability when construction schedules demand it. With questions about the industry's ability to support an increase in shipbuilding, both Newport News and Ingalls have undertaken an extensive inventory of our suppliers and assessed their ability to ramp up their capacity. We have engaged many of our key suppliers to assess their ability to respond to an increase in production. The fortunes of related industries also impact our suppliers, and an increase in demand from the oil and gas industry may stretch our supply base. Although some low to moderate risk remains, I am convinced that our suppliers will be able to meet the forecasted Navy demand.... I strongly believe that the fastest results can come from leveraging successful platforms on current hot production lines. We commend the Navy's decision in 2014 to use the existing LPD 17 hull form for the LX(R), which will replace the LSD-class amphibious dock landing ships scheduled to retire in the coming years. However, we also recommend that the concept of commonality be taken even further to best optimize efficiency, affordability and capability. Specifically, rather than continuing with a new design for LX(R) within the ""walls"" of the LPD hull, we can leverage our hot production line and supply chain and offer the Navy a variant of the existing LPD design that satisfies the aggressive cost targets of the LX(R) program while delivering more capability and survivability to the fleet at a significantly faster pace than the current program. As much as 10-15 percent material savings can be realized across the LX(R) program by purchasing respective blocks of at least five ships each under a multi-year procurement (MYP) approach. In the aggregate, continuing production with LPD 30 in FY18, coupled with successive MYP contracts for the balance of ships, may yield savings greater than $1 billion across an 11-ship LX(R) program. Additionally, we can deliver five LX(R)s to the Navy and Marine Corps in the same timeframe that the current plan would deliver two, helping to reduce the shortfall in amphibious warships against the stated force requirement of 38 ships. Multi-ship procurements, whether a formal MYP or a block-buy, are a proven way to reduce the price of ships. The Navy took advantage of these tools on both Virginia-class submarines and Arleigh Burke-class destroyers. In addition to the LX(R) program mentioned above, expanding multi-ship procurements to other ship classes makes sense.... The most efficient approach to lower the cost of the Ford class and meet the goal of an increased CVN fleet size is also to employ a multi-ship procurement strategy and construct these ships at three-year intervals. This approach would maximize the material procurement savings benefit through economic order quantities procurement and provide labor efficiencies to enable rapid acquisition of a 12-ship CVN fleet. This three-ship approach would save at least $1.5 billion, not including additional savings that could be achieved from government-furnished equipment. As part of its Integrated Enterprise Plan, we commend the Navy's efforts to explore the prospect of material economic order quantity purchasing across carrier and submarine programs. At the same hearing, Matthew O. Paxton, president, Shipbuilders Council of America (SCA)—a trade association representing shipbuilders, suppliers, and associated firms—stated the following: To increase the Navy's Fleet to 355 ships, a substantial and sustained investment is required in both procurement and readiness. However, let me be clear: building and sustaining the larger required Fleet is achievable and our industry stands ready to help achieve that important national security objective. To meet the demand for increased vessel construction while sustaining the vessels we currently have will require U.S. shipyards to expand their work forces and improve their infrastructure in varying degrees depending on ship type and ship mix – a requirement our Nation's shipyards are eager to meet. But first, in order to build these ships in as timely and affordable manner as possible, stable and robust funding is necessary to sustain those industrial capabilities which support Navy shipbuilding and ship maintenance and modernization.... Beyond providing for the building of a 355-ship Navy, there must also be provision to fund the ""tail,"" the maintenance of the current and new ships entering the fleet. Target fleet size cannot be reached if existing ships are not maintained to their full service lives, while building those new ships. Maintenance has been deferred in the last few years because of across-the-board budget cuts.... The domestic shipyard industry certainly has the capability and know-how to build and maintain a 355-ship Navy. The Maritime Administration determined in a recent study on the Economic Benefits of the U.S. Shipyard Industry that there are nearly 110,000 skilled men and women in the Nation's private shipyards building, repairing and maintaining America's military and commercial fleets.1 The report found the U.S. shipbuilding industry supports nearly 400,000 jobs across the country and generates $25.1 billion in income and $37.3 billion worth of goods and services each year. In fact, the MARAD report found that the shipyard industry creates direct and induced employment in every State and Congressional District and each job in the private shipbuilding and repairing industry supports another 2.6 jobs nationally. This data confirms the significant economic impact of this manufacturing sector, but also that the skilled workforce and industrial base exists domestically to build these ships. Long-term, there needs to be a workforce expansion and some shipyards will need to reconfigure or expand production lines. This can and will be done as required to meet the need if adequate, stable budgets and procurement plans are established and sustained for the long-term. Funding predictability and sustainability will allow industry to invest in facilities and more effectively grow its skilled workforce. The development of that critical workforce will take time and a concerted effort in a partnership between industry and the federal government. U.S. shipyards pride themselves on implementing state of the art training and apprenticeship programs to develop skilled men and women that can cut, weld, and bend steel and aluminum and who can design, build and maintain the best Navy in the world. However, the shipbuilding industry, like so many other manufacturing sectors, faces an aging workforce. Attracting and retaining the next generation shipyard worker for an industry career is critical. Working together with the Navy, and local and state resources, our association is committed to building a robust training and development pipeline for skilled shipyard workers. In addition to repealing sequestration and stabilizing funding the continued development of a skilled workforce also needs to be included in our national maritime strategy.... In conclusion, the U.S. shipyard industry is certainly up to the task of building a 355-ship Navy and has the expertise, the capability, the critical capacity and the unmatched skilled workforce to build these national assets. Meeting the Navy's goal of a 355-ship fleet and securing America's naval dominance for the decades ahead will require sustained investment by Congress and Navy's partnership with a defense industrial base that can further attract and retain a highly-skilled workforce with critical skill sets. Again, I would like to thank this Subcommittee for inviting me to testify alongside such distinguished witnesses. As a representative of our nation's private shipyards, I can say, with confidence and certainty, that our domestic shipyards and skilled workers are ready, willing and able to build and maintain the Navy's 355-ship Fleet. Employment Impact Building the additional ships that would be needed to achieve and maintain the 355-ship fleet could create many additional manufacturing and other jobs at shipyards, associated supplier firms, and elsewhere in the U.S. economy. A 2015 Maritime Administration (MARAD) report states, Considering the indirect and induced impacts, each direct job in the shipbuilding and repairing industry is associated with another 2.6 jobs in other parts of the US economy; each dollar of direct labor income and GDP in the shipbuilding and repairing industry is associated with another $1.74 in labor income and $2.49 in GDP, respectively, in other parts of the US economy. A March 2017 press report states, ""Based on a 2015 economic impact study, the Shipbuilders Council of America [a trade association for U.S. shipbuilders and associated supplier firms] believes that a 355-ship Navy could add more than 50,000 jobs nationwide."" The 2015 economic impact study referred to in that quote might be the 2015 MARAD study discussed in the previous paragraph. An estimate of more than 50,000 additional jobs nationwide might be viewed as a higher-end estimate; other estimates might be lower. A June 14, 2017, press report states the following: ""The shipbuilding industry will need to add between 18,000 and 25,000 jobs to build to a 350-ship Navy, according to Matthew Paxton, president of the Shipbuilders Council of America, a trade association representing the shipbuilding industrial base. Including indirect jobs like suppliers, the ramp-up may require a boost of 50,000 workers."" Appendix E. A Summary of Some Acquisition Lessons Learned for Navy Shipbuilding This appendix presents a general summary of lessons learned in Navy shipbuilding, reflecting comments made repeatedly by various sources over the years. These lessons learned include the following: At the outset, get the operational requirements for the program right. Properly identify the program's operational requirements at the outset. Manage risk by not trying to do too much in terms of the program's operational requirements, and perhaps seek a so-called 70%-to-80% solution (i.e., a design that is intended to provide 70%-80% of desired or ideal capabilities). Achieve a realistic balance up front between operational requirements, risks, and estimated costs. Impose cost discipline up front. Use realistic price estimates, and consider not only development and procurement costs, but life-cycle operation and support (O&S) costs. Employ competition where possible in the awarding of design and construction contracts. Use a contract type that is appropriate for the amount of risk involved , and structure its terms to align incentives with desired outcomes. Minimize design/construction concurrency by developing the design to a high level of completion before starting construction and by resisting changes in requirements (and consequent design changes) during construction. Properly supervise construction work. Maintain an adequate number of properly trained Supervisor of Shipbuilding (SUPSHIP) personnel. Provide stability for industry , in part by using, where possible, multiyear procurement (MYP) or block buy contracting. Maintain a capable government acquisition workforce that understands what it is buying, as well as the above points. Identifying these lessons is arguably not the hard part—most if not all these points have been cited for years. The hard part, arguably, is living up to them without letting circumstances lead program-execution efforts away from these guidelines. Appendix F. Some Considerations Relating to Warranties in Shipbuilding and Other Defense Acquisition This appendix presents some considerations relating to warranties in shipbuilding and other defense acquisition. In discussions of Navy (and also Coast Guard) shipbuilding, one question that sometimes arises is whether including a warranty in a shipbuilding contract is preferable to not including one. The question can arise, for example, in connection with a GAO finding that ""the Navy structures shipbuilding contracts so that it pays shipbuilders to build ships as part of the construction process and then pays the same shipbuilders a second time to repair the ship when construction defects are discovered."" Including a warranty in a shipbuilding contract (or a contract for building some other kind of defense end item), while potentially valuable, might not always be preferable to not including one—it depends on the circumstances of the acquisition, and it is not necessarily a valid criticism of an acquisition program to state that it is using a contract that does not include a warranty (or a weaker form of a warranty rather than a stronger one). Including a warranty generally shifts to the contractor the risk of having to pay for fixing problems with earlier work. Although that in itself could be deemed desirable from the government's standpoint, a contractor negotiating a contract that will have a warranty will incorporate that risk into its price, and depending on how much the contractor might charge for doing that, it is possible that the government could wind up paying more in total for acquiring the item (including fixing problems with earlier work on that item) than it would have under a contract without a warranty. When a warranty is not included in the contract and the government pays later on to fix problems with earlier work, those payments can be very visible, which can invite critical comments from observers. But that does not mean that including a warranty in the contract somehow frees the government from paying to fix problems with earlier work. In a contract that includes a warranty, the government will indeed pay something to fix problems with earlier work—but it will make the payment in the less-visible (but still very real) form of the up-front charge for including the warranty, and that charge might be more than what it would have cost the government, under a contract without a warranty, to pay later on for fixing those problems. From a cost standpoint, including a warranty in the contract might or might not be preferable, depending on the risk that there will be problems with earlier work that need fixing, the potential cost of fixing such problems, and the cost of including the warranty in the contract. The point is that the goal of avoiding highly visible payments for fixing problems with earlier work and the goal of minimizing the cost to the government of fixing problems with earlier work are separate and different goals, and that pursuing the first goal can sometimes work against achieving the second goal. The Department of Defense's guide on the use of warranties states the following: Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 46.7 states that ""the use of warranties is not mandatory."" However, if the benefits to be derived from the warranty are commensurate with the cost of the warranty, the CO [contracting officer] should consider placing it in the contract. In determining whether a warranty is appropriate for a specific acquisition, FAR Subpart 46.703 requires the CO to consider the nature and use of the supplies and services, the cost, the administration and enforcement, trade practices, and reduced requirements. The rationale for using a warranty should be documented in the contract file.... In determining the value of a warranty, a CBA [cost-benefit analysis] is used to measure the life cycle costs of the system with and without the warranty. A CBA is required to determine if the warranty will be cost beneficial. CBA is an economic analysis, which basically compares the Life Cycle Costs (LCC) of the system with and without the warranty to determine if warranty coverage will improve the LCCs. In general, five key factors will drive the results of the CBA: cost of the warranty + cost of warranty administration + compatibility with total program efforts + cost of overlap with Contractor support + intangible savings. Effective warranties integrate reliability, maintainability, supportability, availability, and life-cycle costs. Decision factors that must be evaluated include the state of the weapon system technology, the size of the warranted population, the likelihood that field performance requirements can be achieved, and the warranty period of performance. Appendix G. Some Considerations Relating to Avoiding Procurement Cost Growth vs. Minimizing Procurement Costs This appendix presents some considerations relating to avoiding procurement cost growth vs. minimizing procurement costs in shipbuilding and other defense acquisition. The affordability challenge posed by the Navy's shipbuilding plans can reinforce the strong oversight focus on preventing or minimizing procurement cost growth in Navy shipbuilding programs, which is one expression of a strong oversight focus on preventing or minimizing cost growth in DOD acquisition programs in general. This oversight focus may reflect in part an assumption that avoiding or minimizing procurement cost growth is always synonymous with minimizing procurement cost. It is important to note, however, that as paradoxical as it may seem, avoiding or minimizing procurement cost growth is not always synonymous with minimizing procurement cost, and that a sustained, singular focus on avoiding or minimizing procurement cost growth might sometimes lead to higher procurement costs for the government. How could this be? Consider the example of a design for the lead ship of a new class of Navy ships. The construction cost of this new design is uncertain, but is estimated to be likely somewhere between Point A (a minimum possible figure) and Point D (a maximum possible figure). (Point D, in other words, would represent a cost estimate with a 100% confidence factor, meaning there is a 100% chance that the cost would come in at or below that level.) If the Navy wanted to avoid cost growth on this ship, it could simply set the ship's procurement cost at Point D. Industry would likely be happy with this arrangement, and there likely would be no cost growth on the ship. The alternative strategy open to the Navy is to set the ship's target procurement cost at some figure between Points A and D—call it Point B—and then use that more challenging target cost to place pressure on industry to sharpen its pencils so as to find ways to produce the ship at that lower cost. (Navy officials sometimes refer to this as ""pressurizing"" industry.) In this example, it might turn out that industry efforts to reduce production costs are not successful enough to build the ship at the Point B cost. As a result, the ship experiences one or more rounds of procurement cost growth, and the ship's procurement cost rises over time from Point B to some higher figure—call it Point C. Here is the rub: Point C, in spite of incorporating one or more rounds of cost growth, might nevertheless turn out to be lower than Point D, because Point C reflected efforts by the shipbuilder to find ways to reduce production costs that the shipbuilder might have put less energy into pursuing if the Navy had simply set the ship's procurement cost initially at Point D. Setting the ship's cost at Point D, in other words, may eliminate the risk of cost growth on the ship, but does so at the expense of creating a risk of the government paying more for the ship than was actually necessary. DOD could avoid cost growth on new procurement programs starting tomorrow by simply setting costs for those programs at each program's equivalent of Point D. But as a result of this strategy, DOD could well wind up leaving money on the table in some instances—of not, in other words, minimizing procurement costs. DOD does not have to set a cost precisely at Point D to create a potential risk in this regard. A risk of leaving money on the table, for example, is a possible downside of requiring DOD to budget for its acquisition programs at something like an 80% confidence factor—an approach that some observers have recommended—because a cost at the 80% confidence factor is a cost that is likely fairly close to Point D. Procurement cost growth is often embarrassing for DOD and industry, and can damage their credibility in connection with future procurement efforts. Procurement cost growth can also disrupt congressional budgeting by requiring additional appropriations to pay for something Congress thought it had fully funded in a prior year. For this reason, there is a legitimate public policy value to pursuing a goal of having less rather than more procurement cost growth. Procurement cost growth, however, can sometimes be in part the result of DOD efforts to use lower initial cost targets as a means of pressuring industry to reduce production costs—efforts that, notwithstanding the cost growth, might be partially successful. A sustained, singular focus on avoiding or minimizing cost growth, and of punishing DOD for all instances of cost growth, could discourage DOD from using lower initial cost targets as a means of pressurizing industry, which could deprive DOD of a tool for controlling procurement costs. The point here is not to excuse away cost growth, because cost growth can occur in a program for reasons other than DOD's attempt to pressurize industry. Nor is the point to abandon the goal of seeking lower rather than higher procurement cost growth, because, as noted above, there is a legitimate public policy value in pursuing this goal. The point, rather, is to recognize that this goal is not always synonymous with minimizing procurement cost, and that a possibility of some amount of cost growth might be expected as part of an optimal government strategy for minimizing procurement cost. Recognizing that the goals of seeking lower rather than higher cost growth and of minimizing procurement cost can sometimes be in tension with one another can lead to an approach that takes both goals into consideration. In contrast, an approach that is instead characterized by a sustained, singular focus on avoiding and minimizing cost growth may appear virtuous, but in the end may wind up costing the government more. Appendix H. Size of the Navy and Navy Shipbuilding Rate Size of the Navy Table H-1 shows the size of the Navy in terms of total number of ships since FY1948; the numbers shown in the table reflect changes over time in the rules specifying which ships count toward the total. Differing counting rules result in differing totals, and for certain years, figures reflecting more than one set of counting rules are available. Figures in the table for FY1978 and subsequent years reflect the battle force ships counting method, which is the set of counting rules established in the early 1980s for public policy discussions of the size of the Navy. As shown in the table, the total number of battle force ships in the Navy reached a late-Cold War peak of 568 at the end of FY1987 and began declining thereafter. The Navy fell below 300 battle force ships in August 2003 and as of April 26, 2019, included 289 battle force ships. As discussed in Appendix C , historical figures for total fleet size might not be a reliable yardstick for assessing the appropriateness of proposals for the future size and structure of the Navy, particularly if the historical figures are more than a few years old, because the missions to be performed by the Navy, the mix of ships that make up the Navy, and the technologies that are available to Navy ships for performing missions all change over time, and because the number of ships in the fleet in an earlier year might itself have been inappropriate (i.e., not enough or more than enough) for meeting the Navy's mission requirements in that year. For similar reasons, trends over time in the total number of ships in the Navy are not necessarily a reliable indicator of the direction of change in the fleet's ability to perform its stated missions. An increasing number of ships in the fleet might not necessarily mean that the fleet's ability to perform its stated missions is increasing, because the fleet's mission requirements might be increasing more rapidly than ship numbers and average ship capability. Similarly, a decreasing number of ships in the fleet might not necessarily mean that the fleet's ability to perform stated missions is decreasing, because the fleet's mission requirements might be declining more rapidly than numbers of ships, or because average ship capability and the percentage of time that ships are in deployed locations might be increasing quickly enough to more than offset reductions in total ship numbers. Shipbuilding Rate Table H-2 shows past (FY1982-FY2019) and requested or programmed (FY2020-FY2024) rates of Navy ship procurement.\n\n","[""The current and planned size and composition of the Navy, the rate of Navy ship procurement, and the prospective affordability of the Navy's shipbuilding plans have been oversight matters for the congressional defense committees for many years. On December 15, 2016, the Navy released a force-structure goal that calls for achieving and maintaining a fleet of 355 ships of certain types and numbers. The 355-ship force-level goal is the result of a Force Structure Assessment (FSA) conducted by the Navy in 2016. The Navy states that a new FSA is now underway as the successor to the 2016 FSA. This new FSA, Navy officials state, is to be completed by the end of 2019. Navy officials have suggested in their public remarks that this new FSA could change the 355-ship figure, the planned mix of ships, or both. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests funding for the procurement of 12 new ships, including one Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) class aircraft carrier, three Virginia-class attack submarines, three DDG-51 class Aegis destroyers, one FFG(X) frigate, two John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers, and two TATS towing, salvage, and rescue ships. The Navy's FY2020 five-year (FY2020-FY2024) shipbuilding plan includes 55 new ships, or an average of 11 new ships per year. The Navy's FY2020 30-year (FY2020-FY2049) shipbuilding plan includes 304 ships, or an average of about 10 per year. If the FY2020 30-year shipbuilding plan is implemented, the Navy projects that it will achieve a total of 355 ships by FY2034. This is about 20 years sooner than projected under the Navy's FY2019 30-year shipbuilding plan—an acceleration primarily due to a decision announced by the Navy in April 2018, after the FY2019 plan was submitted, to increase the service lives of all DDG-51 destroyers to 45 years. Although the Navy projects that the fleet will reach a total of 355 ships in FY2034, the Navy in that year and subsequent years will not match the composition called for in the FY2016 FSA. One issue for Congress is whether the new FSA that the Navy is conducting will change the 355-ship force-level objective established by the 2016 FSA and, if so, in what ways. Another oversight issue for Congress concerns the prospective affordability of the Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan. Decisions that Congress makes regarding Navy force structure and shipbuilding plans can substantially affect Navy capabilities and funding requirements and the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base.""]","14630","gov_report","en","None","a6b66279eee0135505b08462e35738e68080a9214e36f710","Summary:","gov_report","532","\nThe report provides an overview of the current and Navy's force structure and shipbuilding plans, as well as the challenges the potential impact of the 355-ship goal.

"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nUnder SBA’s 7(a) loan program, SBA guarantees loans made by commercial lenders to small businesses for working capital and other general business purposes. These lenders are mostly banks, but some are non-bank lenders, including small business lending companies— lenders whose lending activities are not subject to regulation by any federal or state regulatory agency, but were previously licensed by SBA and authorized to provide 7(a) loans to qualified small businesses. The guarantee assures the lender that if a borrower defaults on a loan, the lender will receive an agreed-upon portion (generally between 50 percent and 85 percent) of the outstanding balance. For a majority of 7(a) loans, SBA relies on lenders with delegated authority to approve and service 7(a) loans and to ensure that borrowers meet the program’s eligibility requirements. To be eligible for the 7(a) program, a business must be an operating for-profit small firm (according to SBA’s size standards) located in the United States and must meet the credit elsewhere requirement. Because the 7(a) program is required to serve borrowers who cannot obtain conventional credit at reasonable terms, lenders making 7(a) loans must take steps to ensure that borrowers meet the program’s credit elsewhere requirement. Because SBA relies on lenders with delegated authority to make these determinations, SBA’s oversight of these lenders is particularly important. However, we found in a 2009 report that SBA’s lack of guidance to lenders on how to document compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement was impeding the agency’s ability to oversee compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement. To improve SBA’s oversight of lenders’ compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement, we recommended in 2009 that SBA issue more detailed guidance to lenders on how to document their compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement. As a result, SBA revised its standard operating procedure to state that each loan file must contain documentation that specifically identifies the factors in the present financing that meet the credit elsewhere test, which we believe met the spirit of our recommendation. SBA’s current credit elsewhere criteria for determining 7(a) loan eligibility include the following factors: 1. the business needs a longer maturity than the lender’s policy permits; 2. the requested loan exceeds the lender’s policy limit regarding the amount that it can lend to one customer; 3. the collateral does not meet the lender’s policy requirements; 4. the lender’s policy normally does not allow loans to new businesses or businesses in the applicant’s industry; or 5. any other factors relating to the credit which, in the lender’s opinion, cannot be overcome except for the guarantee. When the 7(a) program was first implemented, borrowers were generally required to show proof of credit denials from banks that documented, among other things, the reasons for not granting the desired credit. Similar requirements remained in effect until 1985, when SBA amended the rule to permit a lender’s certification made in its application for an SBA guarantee to be sufficient documentation. This certification requirement remained when the rule was rewritten in 1996. SBA stated that it believed requiring proof of loan denials was demoralizing to small businesses and unenforceable by SBA. SBA and lender roles vary among 7(a) program categories—including regular 7(a), the Preferred Lenders Program, and SBA Express. Under the regular (nondelegated) 7(a) program, SBA makes the loan approval decision, including the credit determination. Under the Preferred Lenders Program and SBA Express, SBA delegates to the lender the authority to make loan approval decisions, including credit determinations, without prior review by SBA. For each 7(a) program category, lenders are required to ensure that borrowers meet the credit elsewhere requirement for all 7(a) loans. The maximum loan amount under the SBA Express program is $350,000, as opposed to $5 million for other 7(a) loans. The program allows lenders to utilize, to the maximum extent possible, their own credit analyses and loan underwriting procedures. In return for the expanded authority and autonomy provided by the program, SBA Express lenders agree to accept a maximum SBA guarantee of 50 percent. Other 7(a) loans generally have a maximum guarantee of 75 percent or 85 percent, depending on the loan amount. In fiscal year 2016, 1,991 lenders approved 7(a) loans, of which 1,321 approved at least one loan with some form of delegated authority. SBA’s Office of Credit Risk Management is responsible for overseeing 7(a) lenders, including those with delegated authority. SBA created this office in fiscal year 1999 to help ensure consistent and appropriate supervision of SBA’s lending partners. The office is responsible for managing all activities regarding lender reviews; preparing written reports; evaluating new programs; and recommending changes to existing programs to assess risk potential. Generally, the office oversees SBA lenders to identify unacceptable risk profiles using its risk rating system and enforce loan program requirements. According to SBA’s standard operating procedures, one of the agency’s purposes of its monitoring and oversight activities is to promote responsible lending that supports SBA’s mission to increase access to capital for small businesses. In the federal budget, the 7(a) program is generally required to set fees that it charges to lenders and borrowers at a level to cover the estimated cost of the program associated with borrower defaults (in present value terms). To offset some of the costs of the program, such as default costs, SBA assesses lenders two fees on each 7(a) loan. First, depending on the term of the loan, the guarantee fee must be paid by the lender within either 90 days of loan approval or 10 business days of the SBA loan number being assigned. This fee is based on the amount of the loan and the level of the guarantee, and lenders can pass the fee on to the borrower. Second, the servicing fee must be paid annually by the lender and is based on the outstanding balance of the guaranteed portion of the loan. The 7(a) program accounts for a small portion of total small business lending. According to a May 2017 report by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the total debt financing available to small businesses was estimated to be $1.4 trillion. Of that amount, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau estimated that about 7 percent was SBA loans, including 7(a) loans. SBA and some other researchers have suggested that there may be disparities in credit access among small businesses, based on characteristics of the borrower and firm. SBA lists as a strategic objective to “ensure inclusive entrepreneurship by expanding access and opportunity to small businesses and entrepreneurs in communities where market gaps remain.” In 2007, we reported that some studies had noted disparities among some races and genders in the conventional lending market, but the studies did not offer conclusive evidence on the reasons for those differences. Much of the research we reviewed in 2007 relied on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System’s Survey of Small Business Finance, which was last implemented in 2003. Although this survey is no longer available, recently the 12 Federal Reserve Banks conducted the Small Business Credit Survey. In a series of reports based on the more recent survey, researchers found disparities in credit availability based on gender, the age of the firm, and minority status. From fiscal years 2007 through 2016, a majority of loan dollars guaranteed under the 7(a) program went to small businesses that were new, partially or wholly owned by women, or located in a distressed area. As previously mentioned, recent studies we reviewed by the Federal Reserve Banks and other researchers suggest that certain small business borrowers—including businesses that are new or owned by women—have difficulty obtaining conventional small business loans, which may put them at a disadvantage. As shown in figure 1, almost two-thirds of loan dollars guaranteed under the 7(a) program for this period went to small businesses that were in these two categories or located in a distressed area. The remaining 37 percent of 7(a) loan dollars went to businesses that were established, solely male-owned, and not located in economically distressed areas. See appendixes II and III for additional data on 7(a) loans, such as the total volume, percentage of lending provided by year and by state, and other borrower characteristics, including SBA’s loan- and lender-level Small Business Risk Portfolio Solutions score (predictive score) information. In the following figures, we present more detailed data on 7(a) loans to small businesses based on their status as a new business; gender of ownership; location relative to economically distressed areas; and minority ownership for fiscal years 2007 through 2016. New businesses. As shown in figure 2, the percentage of 7(a) loans that went to new businesses decreased from 36 percent in fiscal year 2007 to 23 percent in fiscal year 2011 before increasing to 35 percent by 2016. Gender. From fiscal years 2007 through 2016, the share of the total value of approved 7(a) loans by gender of owner remained fairly consistent (see fig. 3). An average of 70 percent of the total loan value went to male- owned businesses, and the remaining 30 percent went to businesses that were majority (more than 50 percent) or partially (50 percent or less) owned by women. Economically distressed areas. SBA did not provide data on whether 7(a) loans go to businesses located in economically distressed neighborhoods. However, we used data from the American Community Survey for 2011 through 2015, the most recent version available at the time of our analysis, along with zip code information provided by SBA to determine the average poverty rate by zip code (see fig. 4). From fiscal years 2007 through 2016, the proportion of the total value of 7(a) loans approved that went to borrowers in economically distressed areas remained between 23 percent and 26 percent. We defined distressed areas as zip codes where at least 20 percent of the households had incomes below the national poverty line. Minority/Nonminority status of borrower. From fiscal years 2007 through 2016, the proportion of the total value of 7(a) loans approved that went to minority borrowers decreased overall—from 43 percent to 30 percent—with the lowest share at 24 percent in fiscal year 2010 (see fig. 5). The share of approved loan dollars that went to nonminority borrowers varied, increasing to 69 percent in fiscal year 2010 before decreasing to 56 percent in fiscal year 2016. Notably, the share of the total value of loans approved that went to borrowers whose race/ethnicity was categorized as undetermined increased from 5 percent in fiscal year 2007 to 13 percent in fiscal year 2016. This increase does not fully account for the declined share for minority borrowers. However, according to SBA officials, borrowers voluntarily provide self-reported information on race and ethnicity and therefore the associated trend data should be viewed with caution. SBA relies on on-site reviews as its primary mechanism for evaluating lenders’ compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement. The reviews are performed by third-party contractors with SBA staff participation and additional oversight from SBA. According to SBA’s standard operating procedures, these reviews are generally conducted every 12 to 24 months for all 7(a) lenders with outstanding balances on the SBA- guaranteed portions of their loan portfolios of $10 million or more, although SBA may conduct on-site reviews of any SBA lender at any time as it considers necessary. In fiscal year 2016, SBA conducted 40 on-site reviews of 7(a) lenders, representing approximately 35 percent of SBA’s total outstanding 7(a) loan portfolio. As part of SBA’s on-site reviews, reviewers judgmentally selected a sample of approximately 30 to 40 loan files using a risk-based approach. These loan files accounted for approximately 6 percent to 19 percent of each lender’s total gross SBA dollars in fiscal year 2016. For each lender, approximately 70 percent to 90 percent of the loan files in the sample were reviewed to evaluate compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement. According to SBA’s contractors, loans that were selected for other reasons, such as issues related to liquidation, were not required to be reviewed for credit elsewhere compliance. SBA requires lenders to provide a narrative to support the credit elsewhere determination in the credit memorandum included in each loan file. SBA’s standard operating procedures state that lenders must substantiate that credit is not available elsewhere by (1) discussing the criteria that demonstrate an identifiable weakness in a borrower’s credit and (2) including the specific reasons why the borrower does not meet the lender’s conventional loan policy requirements. In keeping with SBA’s documentation requirement, third-party contractors and SBA staff who conduct on-site reviews are supposed to assess whether lenders have adequately documented the credit elsewhere criteria and provided specific reasons supporting the criteria in the credit memorandum. According to SBA’s contractors, adequate documentation of the credit elsewhere determination in the credit memorandum would include not just which of the criteria a borrower met but also a discussion of the basis or justification for the decision. For example, if a lender determined that a borrower needed a longer maturity, the lender should explain in the credit memorandum the reasons why a longer maturity was necessary. SBA’s contractors also told us that they carefully review a lender’s loan policies in preparation for on-site reviews and refer to a lender’s policies throughout the reviews. Reviewers do not attempt to verify the evidence given in support of the credit elsewhere reason beyond the information provided in the credit memorandum. Based on our review of fiscal year 2016 reports, on-site reviews can result in three levels of noncompliance response: Finding: This is the most severe result and is associated with a corrective action for the lender to remedy the issue. Observation: This is a deficiency recorded in the review’s summary but may not warrant a corrective action for the lender. Deficiency Noted: This is the lowest level of response. It is a deficiency noted as part of the review that is not included in the review’s summary and also may not warrant a corrective action. According to SBA officials, SBA’s policy has been that any noncompliance with SBA loan program requirements results in a finding. However, according to SBA officials and our review of the fiscal year 2016 on-site review reports, if a single instance of noncompliance was identified in fiscal year 2016, SBA generally would not issue a finding. Instead, SBA’s contractors said they would attempt to determine whether that instance was an inadvertent error, such as by examining additional loan files. Lenders that are subject to corrective actions are generally required to submit a response to SBA within 30 days to document how they have addressed or plan to address the identified issues. SBA subsequently asks for documentation to show that the lender has remedied the issue, and in some cases will conduct another review that usually includes an assessment of 5 to 10 additional loan files to determine whether the credit elsewhere reason has been adequately documented. According to SBA officials, SBA may also review lenders’ compliance with corrective actions from recent on-site reviews during targeted reviews (discussed below) and delegated authority renewal reviews (for lenders with delegated authority). In addition to on-site reviews, SBA also monitors lenders’ compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement through targeted reviews (performed on- or off-site). Targeted reviews of a specific process or issue may be conducted for a variety of reasons at SBA’s discretion, including assessing a lender’s compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement. In fiscal year 2016, SBA conducted 24 targeted reviews that included an examination of lenders’ compliance with the credit elsewhere documentation requirement. For these reviews, SBA examined loan files for 5 judgmentally selected loans that were provided to SBA electronically, as well as copies of the credit elsewhere reasoning (among other underwriting documentation) for 10 additional recently-approved loans. SBA also conducts periodic off-site reviews that use loan- and lender- level portfolio metrics to evaluate the risk level of lenders’ 7(a) portfolios. According to agency officials, SBA also began using off-site reviews to evaluate lenders’ compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement in fiscal year 2016. In that year, SBA conducted off-site reviews of 250 lenders and required these lenders to report the credit elsewhere justification for a sample of 10 loans per lender that were identified by SBA’s selection process. Lenders were not required to provide supporting documentation, and SBA did not follow up with lenders or review loan files to ensure the validity of the self-reported reasons. According to SBA, off-site reviews followed the same procedures in fiscal year 2017 as in 2016 and that the agency planned to use the same procedures for these reviews in the future. According to the agency, it also routinely evaluates and revises its review processes and procedures. In addition, SBA’s Loan Guaranty Processing Center and National Guaranty Purchase Center conduct Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act and quality control reviews at the time of loan approval and at the time of guaranty purchase, respectively. These reviews examine the credit elsewhere requirement, among other issues. Lastly, since 2014 SBA’s Office of Inspector General has also examined whether high-dollar or early-defaulted 7(a) loans were made in accordance with rules; regulations; policies; and procedures, including the credit elsewhere requirement. Our review of the on-site reviews conducted in fiscal year 2016 found that 17 of the 40 reviews—more than 40 percent—identified compliance issues with the credit elsewhere documentation requirement. Of those 17 reviews, 10 reviews resulted in a Finding (all with associated corrective 3 reviews resulted in an Observation (none with associated corrective actions or requirements), and 4 reviews resulted in a Deficiency Noted (one with an associated requirement). For all of the 17 on-site reviews that identified an instance of noncompliance, the issue was related to the lender’s documentation of the credit elsewhere criteria or justification. For example, one review found that the lender’s “regulatory practices demonstrate material noncompliance with SBA Loan Program requirements regarding documentation of the Credit Elsewhere Test.” Another review found that the lender “failed to demonstrate with adequate documentation that credit was not available elsewhere on reasonable terms and conditions.” For 2 of the 17 reviews, the issue was partly related to a discrepancy between the credit elsewhere justification used for some of the sample loan files and the lender’s own loan policy limits. With regard to SBA’s targeted reviews, 7 of 24 reviews (29 percent) conducted in fiscal year 2016 found a compliance issue with the credit elsewhere requirement. Of those 7 reviews, 6 reviews resulted in a Finding (all with associated corrective actions), 1 review resulted in an Observation (without an associated corrective no reviews resulted in a Deficiency Noted. For all of the 7 targeted reviews that identified a compliance issue, the issue was wholly related to the lender’s documentation of the credit elsewhere reason or justification. For example, 4 reviews found that for at least one loan reviewed, “the Lender failed to document justification that credit was unavailable elsewhere.” Another review found that for “three SBA Express loans and one Small Loan Advantage loan reported “other factors relating to the credit that in the lender’s opinion cannot be overcome except for the guaranty’ without specific identification of the factors.” Based on our review of on-site review reports and an interview with one reviewer, the key factors underlying lenders’ high rate of noncompliance with the credit elsewhere documentation requirement were lenders’ lack of proper internal controls and procedures and lack of awareness of the credit elsewhere documentation requirement. In fiscal year 2016, SBA’s corrective actions related to the credit elsewhere requirement required the lenders to establish or strengthen their policies; procedures; underwriting processes; or internal controls. In addition, contractors conducting the on- site reviews with whom we spoke stated that some lenders appeared to be unfamiliar with SBA’s standard operating procedures or were unclear on how to interpret them. For the 11 on-site reviews conducted in 2016 that included corrective actions, SBA generally required lenders to improve controls or procedures. For example, one lender was required to “correct its policy, modify its procedure, and amend its internal controls to ensure that its consideration and documentation of credit unavailable elsewhere identifies the specific fact(s) which are applicable to the specific loan and the determination is rendered and accurate for each individual SBA loan that it originates.” Another lender was required to “improve underwriting processes and controls to ensure that the borrower meets the [credit elsewhere] requirement” and to “document the loan file with the reasons for the determination.” Similarly, for the six targeted reviews in 2016 that included corrective actions, SBA issued a general requirement for the lender to “identify the causes for the Findings and implement corrective actions.” Based on our review of these targeted reviews, lenders generally remedied or intended to remedy the issue by amending their internal controls or procedures. For example, one lender stated that the “Credit Elsewhere test will be incorporated into the Credit Department process.” Another lender stated that it would “centralize all SBA underwriting and has developed an SBA addendum that will be utilized for all SBA-guaranteed loans.” Although some of SBA’s on-site reviews for fiscal year 2016 identified factors leading to noncompliance, they generally did not document reviewers’ assessment of lenders’ policies and practices for complying with the credit elsewhere documentation requirement. SBA’s standard operating procedures state that the on-site reviewers should determine whether or not lenders’ policies and practices adhere to the requirement, but they do not require them to document their assessment of these policies and practices. Only 4 of the 40 fiscal year 2016 review reports that we examined included such an assessment. As a result, although SBA required corrective actions by the lender to address deficiencies, there usually was no record of the underlying factors that resulted in the lender’s noncompliance. Federal internal control standards state that management should design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks, including appropriate documentation of transactions and internal control. Because SBA does not require reviewers to document their assessment of lenders’ policies and practices for complying with the credit elsewhere documentation requirement, the agency does not have good information to help explain why so many lenders are not in compliance. This hinders SBA’s ability to take informed and effective actions to improve lender compliance with the requirement and ensure that the program is reaching its intended population. SBA does not routinely collect information on the criteria lenders use in their credit elsewhere justifications. As previously discussed, lenders are required to maintain documentation of borrower eligibility (including the credit elsewhere justification) in each loan file for loans approved through lenders’ delegated authority. However, SBA cannot readily aggregate information on lenders’ credit elsewhere justifications for both delegated and nondelegated loans: For delegated loans, lenders are required to certify the loan’s credit elsewhere eligibility on E-Tran, SBA’s online portal for origination of delegated and nondelegated loans. However, lenders are only required to check a box to certify that the loan file contains the required credit elsewhere justification and are not required to submit any additional information, including which of the criteria was used to make the determination. According to SBA officials, delegated loans account for loans approved by approximately 70 percent of lenders. For nondelegated loans, lenders are required to submit credit elsewhere documentation to be reviewed by SBA’s Loan Guaranty Processing Center. For these loans, which comprise loans approved by the remaining 30 percent of lenders, SBA might maintain paper records of data on borrowers’ eligibility but does not compile such data electronically and thus cannot readily aggregate the data for analysis. Instead, SBA relies on on-site reviews or lender-reported information to review lenders’ credit elsewhere justifications and collects limited data from these reviews. For its on-site reviews, SBA does not collect sample data on lenders’ use of the credit elsewhere criteria. For its off-site reviews, SBA collected sample data on lenders’ use of the credit elsewhere criteria based on 250 such reviews conducted in fiscal year 2016. For these reviews, SBA asked lenders to self-report a short description of the credit elsewhere justifications used for an SBA-selected sample of 10 loans. However, as discussed earlier, SBA did not request or examine loan files as part of these off-site reviews and did not follow up with lenders or review loan files to ensure the validity of the self- reported reasons. One reason why SBA does not routinely collect complete information on lenders’ use of the credit elsewhere criteria is that SBA’s loan origination system, E-Tran, is not equipped to record or tabulate this information. In addition, according to an SBA official, on-site reviews do not collect data on the credit elsewhere criteria because the loans reviewed are judgmentally selected and would not accurately represent the larger population. Federal internal control standards state that management should use quality information to achieve the entity’s objectives. To do so, management should identify the information needed to achieve the objectives and address the risks, obtain relevant data from reliable internal and external sources in a timely manner, and process the obtained data into quality information. More robust information on lenders’ credit elsewhere justifications, including the credit elsewhere criteria, would allow SBA to evaluate patterns in lender practices related to the credit elsewhere requirement and, in turn, help the agency ensure compliance with the requirement. In this context, generalizable data, which can be collected through random sampling, or complete data through required reporting for every loan would allow SBA to better understand patterns in lender practices across the 7(a) program. Further, nongeneralizable data, which are available through SBA’s current off- and on-site review processes, would allow SBA to examine specific groups of lenders and could help SBA determine if it is necessary to collect additional data. SBA does not analyze the limited data it collects to help it monitor lenders’ compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement. According to agency officials, SBA has not performed lender-level analyses of the criteria lenders use for their credit elsewhere justifications. Additionally, SBA has not analyzed 7(a) lenders’ use of the “other factors” criterion— that is, factors not specified in the other criteria that, in the lender’s opinion, cannot be overcome except for the guarantee—for example, by collecting data on the frequency of its use or examining why lenders rely on it. While some 7(a) lenders told us they avoided relying on the “other factors” criterion because it was vague and open to interpretation, some lenders have used it when a borrower’s profile did not meet any of the other criteria. For example, one lender stated that this criterion was used for a borrower who was no longer a start-up but had experienced fluctuations in cash flow due to relocation or change in ownership. Another lender stated that the criterion was used more frequently during the 2007-2009 financial recession to extend financing to borrowers whose owners had experienced a home foreclosure but were otherwise sound. Federal internal control standards state that management should establish and operate monitoring activities to monitor the internal control system and evaluate the results. Analyzing data on lenders’ use of the credit elsewhere criteria as part of its monitoring procedures could help SBA determine whether there are patterns in lender practices related to the criteria that could predict lender noncompliance. For example, SBA could analyze lenders’ use of the criteria along with lender review results and other data on loan characteristics and performance to determine whether certain patterns indicate that a lender might be applying the requirement inconsistently. Additionally, such analysis could inform SBA’s selection of which lenders to review by improving its ability to identify lenders at risk of noncompliance with the credit elsewhere requirement. Better selection criteria for its lender reviews could, in turn, improve identification and remediation of such noncompliance, helping ensure that the 7(a) program serves its target population. Representatives at 8 of the 11 lenders that we contacted said they believed that SBA’s current credit elsewhere criteria are adequate in targeting small business borrowers who cannot obtain credit at reasonable terms. Representatives of these lenders also agreed that the criteria generally serve the types of small businesses that would otherwise have trouble obtaining conventional credit, such as new businesses or those with a shortage of collateral. One lender representative told us its most commonly used criterion related to the overall time in business because of the higher risk of failure. Another lender representative cited the lack of collateral as the most common criterion used. Additionally, representatives at an industry association told us that one of the most commonly used criteria was the one related to loan maturity and many small businesses seek 7(a) loans because they offer repayment terms of up to 10 years, compared to 1 to 3 years for conventional loans. Representatives of two other lenders suggested that the credit elsewhere criteria should not be overly prescriptive, which could limit lenders’ ability to make 7(a) loans to some businesses. For example, one representative said the credit elsewhere criteria should remain flexible because banks have different lending policies. In addition, representatives at three lenders indicated that they were hesitant to use the “other factors” criterion. One lender believed the requirement was open to interpretation and could be used inappropriately with lenders determining their own individual conventional loan policies. Another lender commented that the criterion was vague and rarely used by his institution, noting that SBA should provide some additional guidance on its use. Lenders consider multiple factors in determining whether to offer small businesses a conventional loan or a 7(a) loan, according to stakeholders with whom we spoke. For example, representatives at an industry association stated that a bank goes through several analyses to determine what loan product to offer the borrower. These representatives stated that the credit elsewhere requirement is embedded in the analysis a bank performs, such as whether the borrower qualifies for a loan and has a financial need for an SBA loan and whether the 7(a) program is right for that borrower. Representatives at two other lenders also stated that many small businesses have already been turned down for conventional loans before they seek a 7(a) loan. One representative noted that the “reasonable rates and terms” component of the 7(a) program was important as it allows lenders to look more broadly at a borrower’s needs. For instance, the representative explained, lenders can assess whether repayment terms are reasonable given a particular borrower’s situation and the resources the borrower will have to repay the loan. Economic conditions also affect lending policies, including whether borrowers qualify for a conventional loan, according to representatives at seven lenders with whom we spoke. For example, during the recent economic downturn, banks tightened their underwriting standards for small businesses and were less willing to lend without a government guarantee, according to one lender representative. SBA has issued revised primary operational guidance for the 7(a) program, effective January 1, 2018. As discussed previously, lenders are required to make a determination that the desired credit is not available to the applicant from nonfederal sources. Under the previous guidance, the lender had to determine that some or the entire loan was not available from nonfederal sources or the resources of the applicant business. However under the revised guidance, the scope of nonfederal sources a lender must review was further defined to include sources both related and unrelated to the applicant. The updated guidance states that lenders must consider: Nonfederal sources related to the applicant, including the liquidity of owners of 20 percent or more of the equity of the applicant, their spouses and minor children, and the applicant itself; or Nonfederal sources unrelated to the applicant, including conventional lenders or other sources of credit. Representatives of five lenders told us they have been determining how to interpret the new procedures with a few stating they would like additional guidance, including what information to retain in the file. Representatives of two lenders stated that there is some ambiguity in how to determine nonfederal resources and how to assess whether small business owners have too many available liquid resources to qualify for a 7(a) loan. One representative said that lenders can have different interpretations of what constitutes “available resources,” which is not specified in the new SOP. As a result, he said, there may be some confusion about how to assess family members of the borrower who have high net worths and whether the borrower should decline a family member contribution to qualify for an SBA loan. A representative of one lender stated that lenders will not know what SBA expects until loans are approved under the new procedures, default, and are then reviewed. Another lender’s representative suggested additional guidance on documentation, such as whether the bank must obtain a personal financial statement for each owner of the business. A SBA staff told us SBA has provided multiple training presentations to SBA staff, lenders, and trade associations on the statutory changes to the credit elsewhere requirements and standard operating procedure updates. These have included a presentation at a trade association conference, four monthly conference calls for SBA staff, and two conference calls for SBA lenders. SBA staff said SBA also plans to hold monthly training sessions with SBA field offices, quarterly training sessions with the industry, and at least four training sessions in 2018 at lender trade conferences. Additionally, a representative from an industry association told us it is providing industry training on SBA’s revised procedures, including the credit elsewhere liquidity requirement. SBA’s 7(a) loan program is required to serve creditworthy small business borrowers who cannot obtain credit through a conventional lender at reasonable terms, and SBA largely relies on lenders with delegated authority to make credit elsewhere determinations. However, although there is a high rate of lender noncompliance with the credit elsewhere documentation requirement, SBA does not require its reviewers to document their assessment of the policies and procedures lenders use to meet the requirement. Without better information from lender reviews on how lenders are implementing the requirement to document their credit elsewhere decisions, SBA may be limited in its ability to promote compliance with requirements and, in turn, use such information to help ensure that 7(a) loans are reaching their target population. Furthermore, SBA does not routinely collect or analyze information on the criteria used for credit elsewhere justifications to evaluate patterns in lender practices. SBA recently began collecting some information on lenders’ use of the criteria, but this information is limited, and SBA does not analyze the information that it does collect to better understand lenders’ practices. Without more robust information and analysis, SBA may be limited in its ability to understand how lenders are using the credit elsewhere criteria and whether 7(a) loans are reaching borrowers who cannot obtain credit from other sources at reasonable terms. We are making the following three recommendations to SBA. The Administrator of SBA should require reviewers to consistently document their assessments of a lender’s policies and practices. (Recommendation 1) The Administrator of SBA should use its on-site and off-site reviews to routinely collect information on lenders’ use of credit elsewhere criteria as part of its monitoring of lender practices related to the credit elsewhere requirement. (Recommendation 2) The Administrator of SBA should analyze information on lenders’ use of credit elsewhere criteria obtained from its reviews to identify lenders that may be at greater risk of noncompliance and to inform its selection of lenders for further review for credit elsewhere compliance. (Recommendation 3) We provided a draft of this report for review and comment. SBA’s written comments are reprinted in appendix IV. SBA generally agreed with the recommendations. SBA also provided additional comments on certain statements in the draft report, which are summarized below with our responses. SBA noted that the draft Highlights did not discuss how credit elsewhere is determined for nondelegated loans. We have not revised the Highlights in response to this comment because our review focused on delegated lenders. In the body of the report we note that approximately 70 percent of 7(a) loans are approved under delegated authority. We also refer to SBA’s nondelegated loans in the report for additional context. According to SBA, the statement on our draft Highlights did not fully reflect its monitoring of lender compliance. SBA identified a variety of reviews it uses in addition to on-site reviews by third party contractors, which we discuss in the body of the report. We have modified the Highlights to reflect these other reviews. Also in reference to the draft Highlights, SBA stated that it provides oversight on every on-site lender review and that an SBA employee is present as a subject-matter expert on every review. We revised the Highlights by adding that SBA provides oversight to the on-site reviews conducted by third-party contractors. In response to a statement in our draft report that SBA guarantees loans to small businesses for working capital and other general business purposes, SBA commented that working capital generally is not the primary purpose for SBA-guaranteed loans. We did not revise the statement because SBA’s SOP 50 10 5 (version J) specifies that SBA’s 7(a) loan proceeds may be used for permanent working capital and revolving working capital, among other things. In relation to a footnote in our report that mentions two lender reviews for which we did not receive documentation, SBA stated that on February 15, 2018, it provided documentation to us related to the reviews and that we had confirmed its receipt. However, the text in the footnote in question refers to two targeted lender reviews from 2016 that included corrective actions. The information SBA provided to us on February 15, 2018, was related to on-site reviews conducted in 2016. As a result, we did not revise the footnote. SBA’s letter also contained technical comments that we incorporated as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to congressional committees, agencies, and other interested parties. In addition, this report will be available at no charge on our website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff members have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-8678 or shearw@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix V. This report discusses (1) 7(a) lending to selected categories of small business borrowers from fiscal years 2007 through 2016; (2) how the Small Business Administration (SBA) monitors lenders’ compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement; (3) the extent to which SBA evaluates trends in lender practices related to the credit elsewhere requirement; and (4) lenders’ views on the criteria used to determine eligibility for 7(a) loans and other issues related to the 7(a) program. For background on the 7(a) program and the credit elsewhere requirement, we reviewed the legislative history of the 7(a) program and our previous reports. We also interviewed officials from SBA’s Office of Credit Risk Management on guidance provided to 7(a) lenders. For background on constraints in the small business credit market, we reviewed recent academic literature on the characteristics of small businesses that historically have had more difficulty accessing credit. In addition, we reviewed recent studies published by the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta; Cleveland; Kansas City; and New York. To describe the population of borrowers served by the 7(a) program, we selected characteristics (such as gender, minority status, and percentage of new business) that we used in our 2007 report and that were the subject of the recent studies by Federal Reserve Banks. We obtained and analyzed SBA loan-level data to describe 7(a) loans and borrowers. Specifically, SBA provided us with 581,393 records from its administrative data systems, which contained information on all loans approved and disbursed in fiscal years 2007 through 2016. The SBA data included various types of information describing each loan, including the total gross approval amount; the amount guaranteed by SBA; the loan term; and the interest rate; delivery method; and status of the loan. The SBA data also included information on borrower characteristics: Age of business. Firms were classified as new (less than 2 years in operation) or existing. Gender. Firms were classified as 100 percent male-owned; 50 percent or greater women owned; 50 percent or less women-owned; or “unknown.” Information on gender was voluntarily provided by borrowers. Economically distressed area. We identified borrowers in economically distressed areas by matching borrower zip codes provided by SBA to those in the 2011 through 2015 American Community Survey. We defined distressed areas as zip codes where at least 20 percent of households had incomes below the national poverty line. In about 1 percent of the cases, we were unable to classify a lender because a zip code had changed or had insufficient population to report a poverty rate. We consider 1 percent of unmatched cases to be low by data reliability standards. Race/ethnicity. Borrowers were placed in one of nine categories of race/ethnicity, including an “unknown” category. We aggregated these to create minority, nonminority, and undetermined categories. The minority category included all borrowers who reported being a race/ethnicity other than white. The nonminority category included borrowers who reported being white. Information on race was voluntarily provided by borrowers. Industry. Firms were assigned a North American Industrial Classification code. These six-digit codes begin with a two-digit sector code that we used to draw more general conclusions about industries. Geographic information. The data provided the state where the borrower is located. In addition, we obtained information from SBA on loan- and lender-level Small Business Risk Portfolio Solution scores (predictive scores) provided by Dunn & Bradstreet and Fair Isaac Company, for loans approved in fiscal year 2016, the latest available. We were able to obtain predictive scores for approximately 81 percent of the loans for which SBA had provided other information. According to SBA, some loans may not have been disbursed at the time we obtained the predictive scores and, as a result, we do not have scores associated with these loans. We analyzed the information to determine the range of predictive scores and the range of average predictive scores by lender. To assess the reliability of loan-level data on borrower and loan characteristics and predictive scores we received from SBA, we interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about the data and reviewed related documentation. We also conducted electronic testing, including checks for outliers, missing data, and erroneous values. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of describing the characteristics of borrowers who received 7(a) loans and the distribution of predictive scores. To assess how SBA monitors lenders’ compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement and criteria, we reviewed SBA’s standard operating procedures and other guidance on 7(a) program regulations and lender oversight. Specifically, we reviewed SOP 50 10 5 (versions I and J) on Lender and Development Company Loan Programs, SOP 50 53(A) on Lender Supervision and Enforcement, and SOP 51 00, On-Site Lender Reviews/Examinations, as well as information and policy notices related to the credit elsewhere requirement. Additionally, we interviewed representatives including those at SBA’s Office of Capital Access and Office of Credit Risk Management on lender oversight and lender review processes. We reviewed all the on-site lender review reports (40 reviews), including corrective actions or requirements related to the credit elsewhere requirement (documentation for 11 lenders), and targeted review reports that had credit elsewhere findings (7 reviews) that SBA conducted in fiscal year 2016. We also interviewed officials and reviewed recent reports from SBA’s Office of Inspector General. To assess the extent to which SBA evaluates trends in lender practices related to the credit elsewhere requirement, we interviewed SBA officials and reviewed documentation for SBA’s online portal for loan origination. We also incorporated information from interviews with a nongeneralizable, nonrepresentative sample of 7(a) lenders, which we discuss below. To obtain lenders’ views on the criteria used to determine eligibility for 7(a) loans and other program-related issues, we interviewed SBA staff including from the Office of Capital Access, and representatives of the National Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders; American Bankers Association; Independent Community Bankers Association; and National Federation of Independent Businesses. We also interviewed 11 banks (one bank provided written responses) in order to obtain the lender perspective of credit elsewhere. Nine of the banks were selected by us using a random process that concentrated on larger lenders. These nine lenders selected by us represent about 13 percent of the loans approved and 16 percent of the dollars approved in 2016. In addition, we interviewed two additional banks that represented an industry group – one larger bank and one small bank. Although we partially selected at random, the lenders we interviewed should not be considered generalizable because of the small number. We conducted this performance audit from August 2017 to June 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. In this appendix, we provide information on the total amount and number of approved 7(a) loans and the top eight industry sectors receiving 7(a) loans. Data are also presented on fiscal year 2016 loan volume by state and per capita. As shown in figure 6 below, the total amount of approved 7(a) loans decreased during the period associated with the Great Recession (2007 through 2009). From fiscal year 2009 on, the total amount of approved 7(a) loans increased until a decline in fiscal year 2012. During this timeframe, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 provided fee relief and higher guaranties. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 also provided a temporary increase in Small Business Administration (SBA) Express loan limits to $1 million (instead of $350,000). These programs have since expired. 7(a) Loans by North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. Table 1 shows the largest eight industrial sectors by proportion of the total amount of 7(a) loans approved, using the NAICS code. The combined share of the top eight sectors declined slightly from 85 percent to 80 percent of the total lending from fiscal years 2007 through 2016, with an average of 82 percent. During this period, the Accommodation and Food Services sector had the largest average share of total loan amount at 17 percent, followed by the Retail Trade sector at 15 percent. Approved loan amount and per capita dollars by state. As shown in figure 7, California; Texas; Florida; Georgia; and New York received the highest total of approved loan dollars in fiscal year 2016. The average approval amount across all loans was $380,619. Georgia and Arkansas had the largest average approval amount in 2016. Also, during this period, Utah; Colorado; Georgia; California; and Washington received the highest per capita approved loan dollars. In fiscal-year 2016, creditworthiness varied widely among 7(a) program borrowers. We analyzed creditworthiness using the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Small Business Risk Portfolio Solution score (predictive score), which ranges from 70 to 300, with 300 indicating the least risky loan. According to SBA, loans with scores above 180 are considered “lower risk,” scores between 140 and 179 are considered “moderate risk,” and scores 139 and lower are considered “higher risk.” There did not appear be differences in score based on the gender of the borrower or the age of the business. While SBA relies on the Predictive Score data to identify lenders that may pose excessive risk to the SBA 7(a) portfolio, the data also provide potential insights related to lender implementation of the credit elsewhere requirement. Variation. We found that some 7(a) borrowers were much more creditworthy than others. In 2016, the only year for which we obtained data, the predictive score at origination varied widely among borrowers. In 2016, the scores of borrowers ranged from a low of 91 to a high of 246. However, most scores were between 171 and 203, and the median score was 188. Race/ethnicity. We found that there were slight differences in creditworthiness by race/ethnicity, with median scores ranging from 180 to 189 depending on the category. Specifically, loans to African Americans in 2016 had a median score of 180, and loans to Hispanics had a median score of 183. In contrast, loans to whites had a median score of 188, and loans to Asian and Pacific Islanders had a median score of 189. Lender size. We found that lenders with larger numbers of SBA loans tended to have slightly more creditworthy borrowers. The top 5 percent of lenders had a median average score of 187, whereas the bottom 75 percent of lenders had a median average score of 182.5. Among the top 5 percent of lenders (with 374 loans per lender on average, collectively representing about 70 percent of the loans approved), the average score ranged from 171 to 195. Among all lenders, the average score ranged from 116 to 233. However, because many lenders only approved one or two loans in 2016, the average may reflect very few borrowers for that lender, making it difficult to tell whether the scores reflect a real difference between lenders.

The Joint Explanatory Statement of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 includes a provision for GAO to review the 7(a) program. This report discusses, among other things, (1) how SBA monitors lenders' compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement, (2) the extent to which SBA evaluates trends in lender credit elsewhere practices, and (3) lenders' views on the credit elsewhere criteria for 7(a) loans. GAO analyzed SBA data on 7(a) loans approved for fiscal years 2007–2016, the latest available, and reviewed literature on small business lending; reviewed standard operating procedures, other guidance, and findings from SBA reviews performed in fiscal year 2016; and interviewed lender associations and a nonrepresentative sample of 7(a) lenders selected that concentrated on larger lenders. For its 7(a) loan program, the Small Business Administration (SBA) has largely delegated authority to lenders to make 7(a) loan determinations for those borrowers who cannot obtain conventional credit at reasonable terms elsewhere. To monitor lender compliance with the “credit elsewhere” requirement SBA primarily uses on-site reviews conducted by third-party contractors with SBA participation and oversight, and other reviews. According to SBA guidance, lenders making 7(a) loans must take steps to ensure and document that borrowers meet the program's credit elsewhere requirement. However, GAO noted a number of concerns with SBA's monitoring efforts. Specifically, GAO found the following: Over 40 percent (17 of 40) of the on-site lender reviews performed in fiscal year 2016 identified lender noncompliance with the requirement. On-site reviewers identified several factors, such as weakness in lenders' internal control processes that were the cause for lender noncompliance. Most on-site reviewers did not document their assessment of lenders' policies or procedures, because SBA does not require them to do so. As a result SBA does not have information that could help explain the high noncompliance rate. Federal internal control standards state that management should design control activities, including appropriate documentation, and use quality information to achieve the entity's objectives. Without better information on lenders' procedures for complying with the documentation requirement, SBA may be limited in its ability to promote compliance with requirements designed to help ensure that the 7(a) program reaches its target population. SBA does not routinely collect or analyze information on the criteria used by lenders for credit elsewhere justifications. SBA recently began collecting some information on lenders' use of the criteria, but this information is limited, and SBA does not analyze the information that it does collect to better understand lenders' practices. Federal internal control standards state that management should use quality information to achieve the entity's objectives. Without more robust information and analysis, SBA may be limited in its ability to understand how lenders are using the credit elsewhere criteria and identify patterns of use by certain lenders that place them at a higher risk of not reaching borrowers who cannot obtain credit from other sources at reasonable terms. In general, representatives from 8 of 11 lenders that GAO interviewed stated that SBA's credit elsewhere criteria are adequate for determining small business eligibility for the 7(a) program. These criteria help them target their lending to small businesses that would otherwise have difficulty obtaining conventional credit because they are often new businesses or have a shortage of collateral. However, they also said that other factors—such as lender policies and economic conditions—can affect their decisions to offer 7(a) loans. In January 2018, SBA issued revised guidance for the 7(a) program and has provided training on this new guidance to lenders and trade associations. Lenders told GAO they are still in the process of understanding the new requirements. GAO recommends that SBA (1) require its on-site reviewers to document their assessment of lenders' policies and procedures related to the credit elsewhere documentation requirement, (2) collect information on lenders' use of credit elsewhere criteria, and (3) analyze that information to identify trends. SBA generally agreed with the recommendations.""]","8215","gov_report","en","None","0a835927d5d2333bd2525d5f599e81781d951896cc64ad49","Summary:","gov_report","532","\nThe report provides an overview of the Small Business Administration's (SBA) 7(a) loan program, focusing on l"

Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nConcerned that the federal government was more focused on program activities and processes than the results to be achieved, Congress passed the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA). GPRA sought to focus federal agencies on performance by requiring agencies to develop long-term and annual goals, and measure and report on progress towards those goals annually. Based on our analyses of the act’s implementation, we concluded in March 2004 that GPRA’s requirements had laid a solid foundation for results-oriented management. At that time, we found that performance planning and measurement had slowly yet increasingly become a part of agencies’ cultures. For example, managers reported having significantly more performance measures in 2003 than in 1997, when GPRA took effect government-wide. However, the benefit of collecting performance information is fully realized only when that information is actually used by managers to make decisions aimed at improving results. Although our 2003 survey found greater reported availability of performance information than in 1997, it also showed managers’ use of that information for various management activities generally had remained unchanged. Based on those results, and in response to a request from Congress, in September 2005, we developed a framework intended to help agencies better incorporate performance information into their decision making. As shown in figure 1, we identified five leading practices that can promote the use of performance information for policy and program decisions; and four ways agency managers can use performance information to make program decisions aimed at improving results. Our September 2005 report also highlighted examples of how agencies had used performance information to improve results. For example, we described how the Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration used performance information to identify, develop, and share effective strategies that increased national safety belt usage—which can decrease injuries and fatalities from traffic accidents— from 11 percent in 1985 to 80 percent in 2004. Subsequently, the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA) was enacted, which significantly expanded and enhanced the statutory framework for federal performance management. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs report accompanying the bill that would become GPRAMA stated that agencies were not consistently using performance information to improve their management and results. The report cited the results of our 2007 survey of federal managers. That survey continued to show little change in managers’ use of performance information. The report further stated that provisions in GPRAMA are intended to address those findings and increase the use of performance information to improve performance and results. For example, GPRAMA requires certain agencies to designate a subset of their respective goals as their highest priorities—known as agency priority goals—and to measure and assess progress toward those goals at least quarterly through data-driven reviews. Our recent work and surveys suggest that data-driven reviews are having their intended effect. For example, in July 2015, we found that agencies reported that their reviews had positive effects on progress toward agency goals and efforts to improve the efficiency of operations, among other things. In addition, for those managers who were familiar with their agencies’ data-driven reviews, our 2013 and 2017 surveys showed that the more managers viewed their programs as being subject to a review, the more likely they were to report their agencies’ reviews were driving results and conducted in line with our leading practices. Recognizing the important role these reviews were playing in improving data-driven decision making, our management agenda for the presidential and congressional transition in 2017 included a key action to expand the use of data-driven reviews beyond agency priority goals to other agency goals. More broadly, our recent surveys of federal managers have continued to show that reported government-wide uses of performance information generally have not changed or in some cases have declined. As we found in September 2017, and as illustrated in figure 2, the 2017 update to our index suggests that government-wide use of performance information did not improve between 2013 and 2017. In addition, it is statistically significantly lower relative to our 2007 survey, when we created the index. Moreover, in looking at the government-wide results on the 11 individual survey questions that comprise the index, we found few statistically significant changes in 2017 when compared to (1) our 2013 survey or (2) the year each question was first introduced. For example, in comparing 2013 and 2017 results, two questions had results that were statistically significantly different: The percentage of managers who reported that employees who report to them pay attention to their agency’s use of performance information was statistically significantly higher (from 40 to 46 percent). The percentage of managers who reported using performance information to adopt new program approaches or change work processes was statistically significantly lower (from 54 to 47 percent). As we stated in our September 2017 report, the decline on the latter question was of particular concern as agencies were developing plans to improve their efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability, as called for by an April 2017 memorandum from OMB. In early 2017, the administration announced several efforts intended to improve government performance. OMB issued several memorandums detailing the administration’s plans to improve government performance by reorganizing the government, reducing the federal workforce, and reducing federal agency burden. As part of the reorganization efforts, OMB and agencies were to develop government-wide and agency reform plans, respectively, designed to leverage various GPRAMA provisions. For instance, the April 2017 memorandum mentioned above stated that OMB intends to monitor implementation of the reforms using, among other things, agency priority goals. While many agency-specific organizational improvements were included in the President’s fiscal year 2019 budget, released in February 2018, OMB published additional government-wide and agency reform proposals in June 2018. The President’s Management Agenda (PMA), released in March 2018, outlines a long-term vision for modernizing federal operations and improving the ability of agencies to achieve outcomes. To address the issues outlined in the PMA, the administration established a number of cross-agency priority (CAP) goals. CAP goals, required by GPRAMA, are to address issues in a limited number of policy areas requiring action across multiple agencies, or management improvements that are needed across the government. The PMA highlights several root causes for the challenges the federal government faces. Among them is that agencies do not consistently apply data-driven decision-making practices. The PMA states that smarter use of data and evidence is needed to orient decisions and accountability around service and results. To that end, in March 2018, the administration established the Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset CAP goal to improve the use of data in decision making to increase the federal government’s effectiveness. Over the past 25 years, various organizations, roles, and responsibilities have been created by executive action or in law to provide leadership in federal performance management. At individual agencies and across the federal government, these organizations and officials have key responsibilities for improving performance, as outlined below. OMB: At least every four years, OMB is to coordinate with other agencies to develop CAP goals—such as the one described earlier on leveraging data as an asset—to improve the performance and management of the federal government. OMB is also required to coordinate with agencies to develop annual federal government performance plans to define, among other things, the level of performance to be achieved toward the CAP goals. Following GPRAMA’s enactment, OMB issued guidance for initial implementation, as required by the act, and continues to provide updated guidance in its annual Circular No. A-11, additional memorandums, and other means. Chief Operating Officer (COO): The deputy agency head, or equivalent, is designated as the COO, with overall responsibility for improving agency management and performance through, among other things, the use of performance information. President’s Management Council (PMC): The PMC is comprised of OMB’s Deputy Director for Management and the COOs of major departments and agencies, among other individuals. Its responsibilities include improving overall executive branch management and implementing the PMA. Performance Improvement Officer (PIO): Agency heads designate a senior executive as the PIO, who reports directly to the COO. The PIO is responsible for assisting the head of the agency and COO to ensure that agency goals are achieved through, among other things, the use of performance information. Performance Improvement Council (PIC): The PIC is charged with assisting OMB to improve the performance of the federal government. It is chaired by the Deputy Director for Management at OMB and includes PIOs from each of the 24 Chief Financial Officers Act agencies, as well as other PIOs and individuals designated by the chair. Among its responsibilities, the PIC is to work to resolve government-wide or cross-cutting performance issues, and facilitate the exchange among agencies of practices that have led to performance improvements. Previously, the General Service Administration’s (GSA) Office of Executive Councils provided analytical, management, and administrative support for the PIC, the PMC, and other government-wide management councils. In January 2018, the office was abolished and its functions, staff, and authorities, along with those of the Unified Shared Services Management Office, were reallocated to GSA’s newly created Shared Solutions and Performance Improvement Office. As at the government-wide level—where, as described earlier, the use of performance information did not change from 2013 to 2017—managers’ reported use of performance information at most agencies also did not improve since 2013 (illustrated in figure 3). At the agency level, 3 of the 24 agencies had statistically significant changes in their index scores—1 increase (National Science Foundation) and 2 decreases (Social Security Administration and the Office of Personnel Management). Also, in 2017, 6 agencies had results that were statistically significantly different—4 higher and 2 lower—than the government-wide average (see sidebar). Throughout the report, we highlight two different types of statistically significant results—changes from our last survey in 2013 and differences from the 2017 government-wide average. The former indicates when an agency’s reported use of performance information or leading practices has measurably improved or declined. The latter indicates when it is statistically significantly higher or lower than the rest of government. These results suggest agencies have taken actions that led to improvements in their use of performance information. For example, when a result is a statistically significant increase since 2013, as with the National Science Foundation index score in 2017, this suggests that the agency has adopted practices that led to a measurable increase in the use of performance information by managers. When a result is statistically significantly higher than the government-wide average, like GSA’s 2017 index score, this suggests that the agency’s use of performance information is among the highest results when compared to the rest of government. These agencies could also have insights into practices that led to relatively high levels of performance information use. Finally, when a result is a statistically significant decrease since 2013, as with the Social Security Administration’s index score in 2017, or statistically significantly lower than the government-wide average, like the Department of Homeland Security’s 2017 index score, this suggests the agencies face challenges that are hampering their ability to use performance information. Appendix III provides each agency’s index scores from 2007, 2013, and 2017 to show changes between survey years. When we disaggregated the index and analyzed responses from the 11 questions that comprise the index—which could help pinpoint particular actions that improved the use of performance information—we similarly found relatively few changes in agencies’ recent results. Specifically, we identified 16 instances where agency responses on individual questions were statistically significantly different from 2013 to 2017—10 increases and 6 decreases. This represents about 6 percent of the total possible responses to the 11 survey questions from each of the agencies. In addition, we found 12 instances where an agency’s result on a question was statistically significantly higher (11) or lower (1) than the government-wide average in 2017. For example, the percentage of Social Security Administration (SSA) managers reporting that their peers use performance information to share effective approaches was statistically significantly higher than the government-wide average. Although SSA’s index score had a statistically significant decline in 2017 compared to 2013, the agency’s index score remains relatively high, as it has in prior years. The scope of our work has not allowed us to determine definitively what factors caused the decline in SSA’s index score and whether the decline is likely to continue, although its result on this particular question may indicate a continued strength. Each agency’s results on the 11 questions that comprise the index are presented in appendix I. The agencies’ respective statistically significant results are identified in figure 4. While some agencies had statistically significant improvements on individual questions, and could point to actions that led to improvements in their use of performance information, these improvements should be considered in relation to the range of agency results and the government- wide average. In figure 4, there are five agencies with statistically significant increases on responses to individual questions, where those results were not statistically significantly higher than the government-wide average (see arrows without plus signs for the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, and Justice; the Environmental Protection Agency; and the National Science Foundation). While these represent improvements, they should be considered in relation to the range of agency results and the government-wide average (provided in detail in the agency summaries in appendix I). For example, in 2017, the percentage of managers at the Department of Agriculture who reported that upper management use performance information to inform decisions about program changes was statistically significantly higher than in 2013. However, the department’s 2017 result (37 percent) was relatively lower when compared to the maximum agency result on that question (60 percent). Appendix I presents the results on the index and the 11 questions that comprise it for each of the 24 agencies. When we compared government-wide and agency-level results on selected survey questions that reflect practices that promote the use of performance information, we found that results between 2013 and 2017 generally remained unchanged. As described earlier, there are 10 survey questions that both reflect the five leading practices identified in our past work and had statistically significant associations with higher index scores. As shown in figure 5, government-wide results on 2 of the 10 questions were statistically significantly different, both increases, from 2013 to 2017. Despite these two increases, the overall results suggest these practices are not widely followed government-wide. On most of the 10 questions, only about half (or fewer) of the managers reported their agencies were following them to a “great” or “very great” extent. When we analyzed agency-level responses to these 10 questions, we also found relatively few changes in recent results. Specifically, our analysis found 20 instances—16 increases and 4 decreases—where agencies’ responses on individual questions were statistically significantly different from 2013 to 2017. This represents about 8 percent of the total possible responses to the 10 survey questions from each of the agencies. In addition, we found 10 instances where an agency’s result on a question was statistically significantly higher (8) or lower (2) than the government-wide average in 2017. Each agency’s results on these 10 questions are presented in appendix I, and the statistically significant results are identified in figure 6. Those agencies with results on individual questions that are either statistically significantly higher than 2013, higher than the 2017 government-wide average, or both may have taken actions in line with our leading practices for promoting the use of performance information. For example, the National Science Foundation had both types of statistically significant results on a question about having sufficient information on the validity of their performance data. Here, the agency’s result increased 27 percentage points from 2013 to 2017. While the scope of our review does not allow us to definitively determine the reasons for the National Science Foundation’s higher results, they suggest the agency has taken recent actions that greatly improved the availability and accessibility of information on the validity of performance data. In both 2013 and 2017, our analyses found this particular question to be the strongest predictor of higher performance information use when we tested for associations between the questions that reflect leading practices and our index. Our 2017 survey results show that managers who reported their programs were subject to data-driven reviews also were more likely to report using performance information in decision making to a greater extent (see figure 7). For the 35 percent of managers who reported being familiar with data-driven reviews, those who reported their programs had been subject to data-driven reviews to a “great” or “very great” extent had index scores that were statistically significantly higher than those whose programs were subject to these reviews to a lesser extent. Similarly, we found that being subject to data-driven reviews to a greater extent was also related to greater reporting of agencies following practices that can promote the use of performance information. As figure 8 shows, managers who reported their programs were subject to these reviews to a “great” or “very great” extent more frequently reported that their agencies followed the five leading practices that promote the use of performance information, as measured by the 10 related survey questions associated with higher scores on the index. For example, of the estimated 48 percent of managers who reported their programs were subject to data-driven reviews to a “great” or “very great” extent, 72 percent also reported that managers at their level (peers) effectively communicate performance information on a routine basis to a “great” or “very great” extent. Conversely, for the 24 percent of managers who reported their programs were subject to data-driven reviews to a “small” or “no” extent, only 30 percent reported that managers at their level do this to a “great” or “very great” extent. Our past work has found that the Executive Branch has taken steps to improve the use of performance information in decision making by senior leaders at federal agencies. However, our survey results indicate those steps have not led to similar improvements in use by managers at lower levels. Through its guidance to implement GPRAMA, OMB developed a framework for performance management in the federal government that involves agencies setting goals and priorities, measuring performance, and regularly reviewing and reporting on progress. This includes expectations for how agency senior leaders should use performance information to assess progress towards achieving agency priority goals through data-driven reviews, and strategic objectives through strategic reviews. For example, GPRAMA requires, and OMB’s guidance reinforces, that data-driven reviews should involve the agency head, Chief Operating Officer, Performance Improvement Officer, and other senior officials responsible for leading efforts to achieve each goal. OMB’s guidance also identifies ways in which agency leaders should use the results of those reviews to inform various decision-making activities, such as revising strategies, formulating budgets, and managing risks. Our past work also found that agencies made progress in implementing these reviews and using performance information. In July 2015, we found that agencies generally were conducting their data-driven reviews in line with GPRAMA requirements and our related leading practices, including that agency leaders used the reviews to drive performance improvement. In addition, in September 2017, we reported on selected agencies’ experiences in implementing strategic reviews and found that the reviews helped direct leadership attention to progress on strategic objectives. Despite those findings, our survey results continue to show that the reported use of performance information by federal managers has generally not improved, and actually declined at some agencies. This could be because of the two different groups of agency officials covered by our work. GPRAMA’s requirements, and the federal performance management framework established by OMB’s guidance, apply at the agency-wide level and generally involve senior leaders. Our past work reviewing implementation of the act therefore focused on improvements in the use of performance information by senior leaders at the agency- wide level. In contrast, our surveys covered random samples of mid- and upper-level managers within those agencies, including at lower organizational levels such as component agencies. Their responses indicate that the use of performance information more broadly within agencies—at lower organizational levels—generally has not improved over time. The exception to this was managers whose programs were subject to the data-driven reviews required by GPRAMA. As described above, those managers were more likely to report greater use of performance information in their agencies. This reinforces the value of the processes and practices put in place by GPRAMA. Our survey results suggest that limited actions have been taken to diffuse processes and practices related to the use of performance information to lower levels within federal agencies, where mid-level and senior managers make decisions about managing programs and operations. Although OMB staff agreed that diffusing processes and practices to lower levels could lead to improved use of performance information, they told us they have not directed agencies to do so for a few reasons. First, OMB staff expressed concerns about potentially imposing a “one-size-fits- all” approach on agencies. They stated that agencies are best positioned to improve their managers’ use of performance information, given their individual and unique missions and cultures, and the environments in which they operate. We agree that it makes sense for agencies to be able to tailor their approaches for those reasons. OMB’s existing guidance provides an overarching framework that recognizes the need for flexibility and for agencies to tailor their approaches. Moreover, given the long- standing and cross-cutting nature of this challenge, a government-wide approach also would provide a consistent focus on improving the use of performance information more extensively within agencies. OMB staff also told us that they believed it would go beyond their mandate to direct agencies to extend GPRAMA requirements to lower levels. GPRAMA requires OMB to provide guidance to agencies to implement its requirements, which only apply at the agency-wide level. As noted earlier, however, GPRAMA also requires OMB to develop cross- agency priority (CAP) goals to improve the performance and management of the federal government. The President’s Management Agenda established a CAP goal to leverage data as a strategic asset, in part, to improve the use of data for decision making and accountability throughout the federal government. This new CAP goal presents an opportunity for OMB and agencies to identify actions to expand the use of performance information in decision making throughout agencies. As of June 2018, the action plan for implementing the Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset CAP goal is limited. According to the President’s Management Agenda and initial CAP goal action plan, the goal primarily focuses on developing and implementing a long-term, enterprise-wide federal data strategy to better govern and leverage the federal government’s data. It is through this strategy that, among other things, the administration intends to improve the use of data for decision making and accountability. However, the strategy is under development and not expected to be released until January 2019, with a related plan to implement it expected in April 2019. The existing action plan, released in March 2018 and updated in June 2018, does not yet include specific steps needed to improve the use of data—including performance information—more extensively within agencies. According to the action plan for the goal, potential actions currently under consideration focus on establishing agency “learning agendas” that prioritize the development and use of data and other evidence for decision-making; building agency capacity to use data and other evidence; and improving the timeliness of performance information and other data, and making that information available to decision makers and the public. Although developing learning agendas and building capacity could help improve the use of performance information in agencies, improving availability of data may be less effective. For example, as our past survey results have shown, increasing the availability of performance information has not resulted in corresponding increases in its use in decision making. We recognize that the CAP goal was created in March 2018. Nonetheless, it is important that OMB and its fellow goal leaders develop the action plan and related federal data strategy consistent with all key requirements to better ensure successful implementation. The action plan does not yet include complete information related to the following GPRAMA requirements: performance goals that define the level of performance to be achieved each year for the CAP goal; the various federal agencies, organizations, programs, and other activities that contribute to the CAP goal; performance measures to assess overall progress towards the goal as well as the progress of each agency, program, and other activity contributing to the goal; and clearly defined quarterly targets. Consistent with GPRAMA, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government identifies information that agencies are required to include in their plans to help ensure they achieve their goals. The standards state that objectives—such as improving the use of data in decision making— should be clearly defined to enable the identification of risks. Objectives are to be defined in specific terms so they can be understood at all levels of the entity—in this case, government-wide as well as within individual agencies. This involves defining what is to be achieved, who is to achieve it, how it will be achieved, and the time frames for achievement. Ensuring that future updates to the new CAP goal’s action plan includes all required elements is particularly important, as our previous work has found that some past CAP goal teams did not meet all planning and reporting requirements. For example, in May 2016 we found that most of the CAP goal teams we reviewed had not established targets for all performance measures they were tracking. This limited the transparency of their efforts and the ability to track progress toward established goals. We recommended that OMB, working with the Performance Information Council (PIC), report on actions that CAP goal teams are taking, or plan to take, to develop such targets and performance measures. OMB staff generally agreed and, in July 2017, told us they were working, where possible, to assist the development of measures for CAP goals. However, the recommendation has not been addressed and OMB staff said the next opportunity to address it would be when the administration established new CAP goals (which took place in March 2018). Following the initial release of the new CAP goals, CAP goal teams are to more fully develop the related action plans through quarterly updates. Given the ongoing importance of meeting these planning and reporting requirements, we will continue to monitor the status of actions to address this recommendation as implementation of the new CAP goals proceeds. While the PIC, which is chaired by OMB, has contributed to efforts to enhance the use of performance information, our survey results identify additional opportunities to further those efforts. The PIC’s past efforts have included hosting various working groups and learning events for agency officials to provide performance management guidance, and developing resources with relevant practices. For example, the PIC created a working group focused on agency performance reviews, which was used to share recommendations for how agencies can implement reviews, along with a guide with practices for effectively implementing strategic reviews. In January 2018, staff supporting the PIC joined with staff from another GSA office to create a new group called Fed2Fed Solutions. This group consults with agencies and provides tailored support, such as data analysis and performance management training for agency officials, to help them address specific challenges related to organizational transformation, data-driven decision making, and other management improvement efforts. Our survey results identify useful information related to potential promising practices and challenges that OMB and the PIC could use to inform efforts to enhance the use of performance information more extensively within agencies (e.g., at lower levels). As was previously described, the PIC has responsibilities to (1) facilitate the exchange among agencies of proven practices, and (2) work to resolve government- wide or cross-cutting performance issues, such as challenges. Our analyses of 2017 survey results identified instances where agencies may have found effective ways to enhance the use of performance information by agency leaders and managers in decision making, as well as instances where agencies (and their managers) face challenges in doing so. Specifically, based on analyses of our survey responses, we identified 14 agencies that may have insights into specific practices that led to recent improvements in managers’ use of performance information, or ways that they maintain relatively high levels of use by their managers when compared to the rest of the government. Figure 9 summarizes the agencies identified earlier in the report that had statistically significant increases, or results higher than the government-wide average, on our index or individual survey questions. As the figure shows, several agencies had statistically significant results across all three sets of analyses and therefore may have greater insights to offer: the General Services Administration, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the National Science Foundation. In addition, our analyses identified nine agencies where results suggest managers face challenges that have hampered their ability to use performance information. Figure 10 summarizes the agencies identified earlier in the report that had statistically significant decreases, or results lower than the government-wide average, on our index or individual survey questions. As the figure shows, the Office of Personnel Management had statistically significant decreases in all three sets of analyses. Four agencies—the Departments of the Treasury and Veterans Affairs, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Social Security Administration—were common to both of the figures above. That is, they had results that indicate they may have insights on some aspects of using performance information and face challenges in other aspects. As was mentioned earlier, to provide proper context, these results should be considered in relation to the range of agency results and the government- wide average (provided in detail in the agency summaries in appendix I). Given the prioritization of other activities, such as the recent creation of the Fed2Fed Solutions program, the PIC has not yet undertaken a systematic approach that could improve the use of performance information by managers at lower levels within agencies. Such an approach would involve identifying and sharing practices that have led to improved use, as well as identifying common or cross-cutting challenges that have hampered such use. The results of our analyses could help the PIC do so, and in a more targeted manner. By identifying and sharing proven practices, the PIC could further ensure that agency leaders and managers are aware of effective or proven ways they can use performance information to inform their decisions across the spectrum of activities they manage within their agencies. Those proven practices also may help agency leaders and managers resolve any identified challenges. Furthermore, in September 2017, we found that, for the estimated 35 percent of managers who reported familiarity with data-driven reviews, the more they viewed their programs being subject to a review, the more likely they were to report the reviews were driving results and were conducted in line with our leading practices for using performance information. Despite the reported benefits of and results achieved through data-driven reviews, they were not necessarily widespread. As noted above, GPRAMA requires agencies to conduct such reviews for agency priority goals, which represent a small subset of goals, and they are required at the departmental level. These reasons may explain why most managers reported they were not familiar with the reviews. As a result, we recommended that OMB should work with the PIC to identify and share among agencies practices for expanding the use of data-driven reviews. OMB staff agreed with our recommendation but have yet to address it. In June 2018, OMB updated its annual guidance to agencies to explicitly encourage them to expand data-driven reviews to include other goals, priorities, and management areas as applicable to improve organizational performance. However, as of June 2018, OMB and the PIC have yet to take any steps to identify and share practices for expanding the use of these reviews in line with our recommendation. Given the additional analyses we conducted for this report—which show that being subject to data-driven reviews is related to greater reported use of performance information and leading practices that promote such use—we continue to believe these further actions would help agencies implement these reviews more extensively. We reiterate the importance of the September 2017 recommendation and will continue to monitor OMB’s progress to address it. For more than 20 years, our work has highlighted weaknesses in the use of performance information in federal decision making. While the Executive Branch has taken some actions in recent years, such as establishing a framework for performance management across the federal government, our survey results underscore that more needs to be done to improve the use of performance information more extensively within agencies and government-wide. The President’s Management Agenda and its related CAP goal to leverage data as a strategic asset present an opportunity to do so, as it aims to improve data-driven decision making. As OMB and its fellow goal leaders more fully develop the action plan for achieving this goal, providing additional details for its plans to improve data-driven decision making would help provide assurance that it can be achieved. As part of those initiatives, our survey results could provide a useful guide for targeting efforts. Officials at each agency could use these results to identify areas for additional analysis and potential actions that could help improve the use of performance information across the agency and at lower levels. Similarly, OMB and the PIC could use the results to identify broader issues in need of government-wide attention. It will also be important, however, for OMB and the PIC to go beyond this analysis and work with agencies to identify and share proven practices for increasing the use of performance information at lower levels within agencies, as well as challenges that may be hampering agencies’ ability to do so. We are making the following two recommendations to OMB: The Director of OMB should direct the leaders of the Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset CAP Goal to ensure future updates to the action plan, and the resulting federal data strategy, provide additional details on improving the use of data, including performance information, more extensively within federal agencies. The action plan should identify performance goals; contributing agencies, organizations, programs, and other activities; those responsible for leading implementation within these contributors; planned actions; time frames; and means to assess progress. (Recommendation 1) The Director of OMB, in coordination with the PIC, should prioritize efforts to identify and share among agencies proven practices for increasing, and challenges that hamper, the use of performance information in decision making more extensively within agencies. At a minimum, this effort should involve the agencies that our survey suggests may offer such insights. (Recommendation 2) We provided a draft of this report to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget for review and comment. We also provided a draft of the report to the heads of each of the 24 federal agencies covered by our survey. OMB had no comments, and informed us that it would assess our recommendations and consider how best to respond. We are sending copies of this report to congressional requesters, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the heads of each of the 24 agencies, and other interested parties.

This report assesses the extent to which: 1. the reported use of performance information and related leading practices at 24 agencies has changed compared to our prior survey in 2013; 2. being subject to data-driven reviews related to managers’ reported use of performance information and leading practices; and 3. the Executive Branch has taken actions to enhance agencies’ use of performance information in various decision-making activities. From November 2016 through March 2017, we administered our online survey to a stratified random sample of 4,395 individuals from a population of 153,779 mid- and upper-level civilian managers and supervisors at the 24 CFO Act agencies. The management levels covered general schedule (GS) or equivalent schedules at levels comparable to GS-13 through GS-15, and career Senior Executive Service (SES) or equivalent. We obtained the sample from the Office of Personnel Management’s Enterprise Human Resources Integration database as of September 30, 2015—the most recent fiscal year data available at the time. The sample was stratified by agency and whether the manager or supervisor was a member of the SES. To help determine the reliability and accuracy of the database elements used to draw our sample of federal managers for the 2017 survey, we checked the data for reasonableness and the presence of any obvious or potential errors in accuracy and completeness and reviewed our past analyses of the reliability of this database. We concluded in our September 2017 report that the data used to draw our sample were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of the survey. For the 2017 survey, we received usable questionnaires from about 67 percent of the eligible sample. The weighted response rate at each agency generally ranged from 57 percent to 82 percent, except the Department of Justice, which had a weighted response rate of 36 percent. The overall survey results are generalizable to the population of managers government-wide and at each individual agency. To assess the potential bias from agencies with lower response rates, we conducted a nonresponse bias analysis using information from the survey and sampling frame as available. The analysis confirmed discrepancies in the tendency to respond to the survey related to agency and SES status. The analysis also revealed some differences in response propensity by age and GS level; however, the direction and magnitude of the differences on these factors were not consistent across agencies or strata. Our data may be subject to bias from unmeasured sources for which we cannot control. Results, and in particular estimates from agencies with low response rates such as the Department of Justice, should be interpreted with caution. However, the survey’s results are comparable to five previous surveys we conducted in 1997, 2000, 2003, 2007, and 2013. To address the first objective, we used data from our 2017 survey to update agency scores on our use of performance information index. This index, which was last updated using data from our 2013 survey, averages managers’ responses on 11 questions related to the use of performance information for various management activities and decision making. Using 2017 survey data, we conducted statistical analyses to ensure these 11 questions were still positively correlated. That analysis confirmed that no negative correlations existed and therefore no changes to the index were needed. Figure 11 shows the questions that comprise the index. After calculating agency index scores for 2017, we compared them to previous results from 2007 and 2013, and to the government-wide average for 2017, to identify any statistically significant differences. We focus on statistically significant results because these indicate that observed relationships between variables and differences between groups are likely to be valid, after accounting for the effects of sampling and other sources of survey error. For each of the 11 questions that comprise the index, we identified individual agency results, excluding missing and no basis to judge responses, and determined when they were statistically significantly different from (1) the agency’s results on the same question in 2013, or (2) the government-wide average results on the question in 2017. In this report, we analyzed and summarized the results of our 2017 survey of federal managers. Due to the limited scope of the engagement, we did not conduct additional audit work to determine what may have caused statistically significant changes between our 2017 and past survey results. To further address this objective we completed several statistical analyses that allowed us to assess the association between the index and 22 survey questions that we determined relate to leading practices we previously found promote the use of performance information. See figure 12 for the 22 specific questions related to these five practices that we included in the analysis. When we individually tested these 22 survey questions (bivariate regression), we found that each was statistically significantly and positively related to the index in 2017. This means that each question, when tested in isolation from other factors, was associated with higher scores on the index. However, when all 22 questions were tested together (multivariate regression), we found that 5 questions continued to be positively and significantly associated with the index in 2017, after controlling for other factors. To conduct this multivariate analysis, we began with a base model that treated differences in managers’ views of agency performance management use as a function of the agency where they worked. We found, however, that a model based on agency alone had little predictive power (R-squared of 0.04). We next examined whether managers’ responses to these questions reflecting practices that promote the use of performance information related to their perceptions of agency use of performance information, independent of agency. The results of this analysis are presented in table 1 below. Each coefficient reflects the increase in our index associated with a one-unit increase in the value of a particular survey question. Our final multivariate regression model had an R-squared of 0.67, suggesting that the variables in this model explain approximately 67 percent of the variation in the use index. We also tested this model controlling for whether a respondent was a member of the SES and found similar results. As shown above in table 1, five questions related to three of the leading practices that promote agencies’ use of performance information were statistically significant in 2017. These results suggest that, when controlling for other factors, certain specific efforts to increase agency use of performance information—such as providing information on the validity of performance data—may have a higher return and lead to higher index scores. With respect to aligning agency-wide goals, objectives, and measures, we found that each increase in terms of the extent to which individuals felt that managers aligned performance measures with agencywide goals and objectives was associated with a 0.08 increase in their score on the use index. In terms of improving the usefulness of performance information, we found that having information on the validity of performance data for decision making was the strongest predictor in our model (0.18). As measured here, taking steps to ensure the performance information is useful and appropriate was associated with almost as large a change in a managers’ index score (0.16). In terms of developing agency capacity to use performance information, we found that having sufficient analytical tools to collect, analyze, and use performance information (0.07), and providing or paying for training that would help link their programs to achievement of agency strategic goals (0.10), were also statistically significantly related to a manager’s reported use of performance information. When we combined these results with what we previously found through a similar analysis of 2013 survey results in September 2014, we identified 10 questions that have had a statistically significant association with higher index scores. This reinforces the importance of the five leading practices to promote the use of performance information. For each of these questions, which are outlined in figure 13 below, we determined when agency results were statistically significantly different from 2013 results or the 2017 government-wide average. For the second objective, we examined, based on the extent they responded their programs had been subject to agency data-driven reviews, differences in managers’ use index scores and responses on questions related to practices that promote the use of performance information. We grouped managers based on the extent they reported their programs had been subject to these reviews, from “no extent” through “very great extent.” We then calculated the average index scores for the managers in each of those five categories. We also examined differences in how managers responded to the 10 questions reflecting practices that can promote the use of performance information based on the extent they reported their programs had been subject to data-driven reviews. We grouped managers into three categories based on the extent they reported their programs had been subject to these reviews (no-small extent, moderate extent, great-very great extent). We then compared how these groups responded to the ten questions. For the third objective, we reviewed our past work that assessed Executive Branch activities to enhance the use of performance information; various resources (i.e., guidance, guides, and playbooks) developed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Performance Improvement Council (PIC) that could support agencies’ use of performance information; and the President’s Management Agenda, and related materials with information on cross-agency efforts to improve the use of data in federal decision making. Lastly, for the third objective we also interviewed OMB and PIC staff about any actions they have taken, or planned to take, to further support the use of performance information across the federal government. We conducted this performance audit from October 2017 to September 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. In addition to the above contact, Benjamin T.

The benefit of collecting performance information is only fully realized when it is used by managers to make decisions aimed at improving results. GAO was asked to review agencies' use of performance information. This report assesses, among other things, the extent to which: (1) 24 agencies' reported use of performance information and related leading practices has changed since 2013 and (2) the Executive Branch has taken actions to enhance the use of performance information. To address the first objective, GAO analyzed results from its 2017 survey of federal managers, and compared them to 2013 results. The survey covered a stratified random sample of 4,395 managers from the 24 Chief Financial Officers Act agencies. The survey had a 67 percent response rate and results can be generalized to the population of managers government-wide and at each agency. For the second objective, GAO reviewed agency documents and interviewed staff from OMB and the PIC. Agencies' reported use of performance information to make decisions, and leading practices that can promote such use, generally has not improved since GAO's last survey of federal managers in 2013. However, GAO's survey results continue to point to certain practices that could help agencies improve managers' use of performance information. For example, as shown in the table below, GAO's survey found that managers whose programs were subject to data-driven reviews (regular reviews used to assess progress on select agency goals) to a greater extent reported statistically significantly greater use of performance information to make decisions. The Executive Branch has begun taking steps to improve the use of performance information within agencies and across the government. For example, In the President's Management Agenda and government-wide reform plan, released in March and June 2018 respectively, the administration acknowledged the need to do more, and announced a goal, among other actions, to improve the use of data in federal decision making. However, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and others responsible for this goal have yet to fully develop action plans to hold agencies accountable for achieving it. The Performance Improvement Council (PIC), which is chaired by OMB, has undertaken efforts to improve the use of performance information by, for example, creating a working group on agency performance reviews. But it has not yet taken a systematic approach to identify and share proven practices that led to, or challenges that may be hampering, increased use of performance information by managers. GAO's survey results identified agencies that may have insights into such practices and challenges. More fully developing action plans for the new goal, and identifying and sharing proven practices and challenges, could help ensure the Executive Branch takes further steps to improve the use of performance information by managers within agencies and across the federal government. To improve the use of performance information within agencies and across the federal government, GAO recommends that OMB work with (1) fellow goal leaders to more fully develop action plans for the new goal to improve the use of data and (2) the PIC to prioritize efforts to identify and share proven practices and challenges.

"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nImplementing Telework: The Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 (the Act) establishes telework implementation requirements for agencies, including, for example, that each agency designate a Telework Managing Officer and that each agency incorporate telework into its continuity of operations plans. The Act does not mention telework specifically in the context of space planning. The Act also requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to assess whether agencies have met agency- established telework outcome goals such as real estate savings. It also requires OPM to submit reports that include executive agencies’ goals for increasing telework participation to the extent practicable, assist each agency with developing qualitative- and quantitative- teleworking measures and goals, and track telework eligibility and participation rates across the government. According to OPM telework information from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2015, the percentage of federal workers eligible to telework remained stable at about 45 percent, on average. However, during the same period, the percentage of eligible employees who participated in telework increased from 29 percent to 46 percent. Figure 1 shows the frequency of telework across the federal government from fiscal years 2012 through 2015 by type of telework. Reducing Space: OMB issued the National Strategy for the Efficient Use of Real Property and the Reduce the Footprint policy in 2015, which require all CFO Act agencies to improve the efficiency of real property use, control costs, and reduce holdings. These OMB initiatives also required agencies to develop Five-Year Real Property Efficiency Plans annually; develop office space standards that specify maximum square footage identify reduction targets for office space in square feet; and freeze the footprint (i.e., not increase square footage of office space). OMB’s National Strategy noted that employee telework has changed the dynamic of the federal real property portfolio and resulted in a need for less space. OMB’s Reduce the Footprint guidance memo states that agencies’ 5-year plans should include an explanation of actions the agency is taking to increase space efficiency, including cost-effective alternatives to acquisition of additional office space, such as consolidation, colocation, teleworking, and “hoteling.” Federal statute also requires that agencies consider whether space needs can be met using alternative workplace arrangements when deciding whether to acquire new space. GSA defines mobility as an overarching term describing the ability of employees, enabled by information technology (IT) and workplace policies to perform work both within and outside the agency worksite. Under this definition, mobility includes telework, desk-sharing, site work, and travel. Agencies can strategically use telework—one form of mobility—combined with desk-sharing and hoteling to reduce space needs and increase efficiency. This allows agencies to plan for fewer workstations than the number of employees. Other space efficiency strategies such as smaller workstations (e.g., reduced space standards), reconfigured office space (e.g., open-office plans instead of private offices), and mobile technology (e.g., laptops, Wi-Fi throughout the office, and smart phones) can be combined with telework and used as planning tools to reduce office space, use space more efficiently, and potentially cut costs. GSA, in a 2010 publication, described a continuum of three different scenarios for the ways agencies may use mobility, including telework. These scenarios range from limited mobility not leveraged for space planning to extensive mobility leveraged for space planning to reduce and use office space more efficiently: (1) No space changes: Some employees telework at least 2 scheduled days per week but retain assigned workstations with no changes to the existing space configuration. (2) No space reduction but different space allocation: Most employees telework at least 2 scheduled days per week and keep assigned workstations. Workstations are smaller and more densely organized; and space freed up by smaller workstations can be used for collaborative work spaces. (3) Space reduction and different space allocation: Nearly all employees telework at least 3 scheduled days per week and participate in hoteling (i.e., unassigned workstations), and workstations are also smaller and more densely organized. In this scenario, according to GSA, an agency can redesign its office and potentially reduce space by up to 30 percent. The key factors in distinguishing these scenarios illustrated in figure 2 below include the: level of employee participation in telework; changes to physical office spaces (e.g., smaller and more densely organized workstations and more emphasis on collaborative workspaces); and extent to which employees have assigned workstations or participate in desk-sharing. Under federal statute, GSA has a role in promulgating rules and developing guidance promoting the efficient use of real property. For example, the GSA Administrator may provide guidance, assistance, and oversight to client agencies regarding the establishment and operation of alternative workplace arrangements, which include leveraging telework to reduce space needs. GSA also directly assists client agencies with identifying and prioritizing opportunities to improve and implement real- property efficiency measures. In reviewing planning documents, policies, and survey data, we found that the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies reported using telework to reduce or use space more efficiently. Specifically, our analysis of (1) agency-wide space-planning policies and procedures and (2) Real Property Efficiency Plans found that all of the agencies discussed telework in the context of space planning and achieving greater space efficiencies. Agencies also provided examples in survey responses of how they have used telework to increase operational effectiveness while optimizing their use of space. Fifteen agencies’ space-planning policies and procedures included provisions for using telework and other mobility strategies, such as hoteling and desk-sharing, as a strategic space-planning tool. Three of the agencies mentioned these strategies only in the context of space planning, and five agencies did not mention them at all (see table 1). For the fifteen agencies with space planning policies that incorporated telework, the documents either expressly directed agency planners to include telework, hoteling, or desk-sharing in space planning; provided instructions and guidance for using these in space planning; or issued space allocation standards for their implementation. Several agency-wide space plans identify space reduction goals based on using telework strategically. For example, the Department of Transportation (DOT) documents identify a goal of at least a 10 percent workspace reduction in new acquisitions as a result of compressed work schedules and telework, and specifically state that employees who telework six or more days per pay period should not have a permanent workspace. Agency-wide space planning documents from three civilian CFO Act agencies mentioned telework, hoteling or desk-sharing as strategies in the context of space planning. For example, DOJ’s agency-wide policy notes that telework and hoteling could increase the efficient use of space and directs each sub-agency to maintain its own space design guidelines within agency-wide policy office space standards. The other two agencies, the Department of State and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, either had a short provisional agency-wide space planning document that laid out space standards or mentioned telework, hoteling and desk-sharing as a tool for creating sustainable space. Five agencies’ space planning documents made no reference to telework; however, one agency, OPM, developed a maximum office space utilization rate and criteria for determining which positions require a private office. As noted above, OMB’s Reduce the Footprint policy (2015) requires agencies to establish Real Property Efficiency Plans. In our analysis of the agencies’ fiscal year 2016 or 2017 plans, we found that 19 of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies discussed telework in the context of space planning. A few agencies’ Real Property Efficiency Plans explicitly stated that the agency reduced space as a result of telework. For example, GSA used telework to reduce space in its Heartland, Rocky Mountain, and National Capital Region offices. Some (5 of 23) Real Property Efficiency Plans discussed the telework pilot programs agencies have initiated. For example, the Department of Education’s plans reported using a pilot program to acclimate employees to teleworking and desk-sharing; as a result, the agency intends to incorporate hoteling or space-sharing opportunities into proposed space designs in future projects. The Social Security Administration (SSA) plans also reported initiating a pilot program to experiment with smaller “hoteling” workspaces. Similarly, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s plan reported conducting a pilot program at its headquarters offices to identify challenges, better understand telework, and evaluate the potential of shared workspaces. In response to our survey, about three-quarters of agencies reported space-planning policies that use telework to reduce office space, lower real estate costs, or reduce the size of individual workstations. Agencies reported accomplishing this by using desk-sharing and hoteling for employees who have relinquished permanent workspaces. For example, several agencies discussed strategies to reduce space in their responses to our survey. The Department of Labor reported using telework to close some small offices resulting in overall space reductions of about 16,000 square feet. OPM reported that it both reduced space and created space efficiencies by transitioning staff in its Eastern Management Development Center to full-time telework and terminating the lease, resulting in a space reduction of about 32,000 square feet. OPM’s Human Resource Solutions Program also achieved a 47 percent space reduction when it instituted desk-sharing and freed the vacated space for use by another program office. The Department of the Treasury reported that its sub-agency, the Internal Revenue Service, has aggressively used telework to help reduce its real property portfolio, while other Treasury units have leveraged telework to achieve significant space reductions. At the end of fiscal year 2016, Treasury reported agency-wide reductions of about 484,000 square feet at a cost savings of about $10 million. Two agencies––Department of Homeland Security, and the National Science Foundation––reported using telework to increase the efficiency of existing office space in sub-agencies by increasing staff without increasing the size of offices, for example: The Department of Homeland Security reported that one of its sub- agencies used telework in the planning and design of a new office, resulting in both a space reduction and more efficient use of the space. The new office is 57,573 square feet smaller than the prior office while personnel assigned to the office increased from 315 to 394. The National Science Foundation reported that it used teleworking, among other workspace strategies such as new space standards and virtual technologies, to increase staff numbers without increasing its real estate footprint. Among the agencies we reviewed in detail—GSA, OJP, CDC, and the Fiscal Service—the use of telework in office space planning varied from emerging consideration to extensive implementation. GSA and OJP have used telework extensively to both reduce space and increase space efficiency in their office spaces. CDC has leveraged telework to reduce space or use space more efficiently in more limited cases while the Fiscal Service has begun to consider telework in future space planning. Appendix II provides additional details on office spaces where these agencies reduced space or used space more efficiently, including the role of telework, if any. GSA has leveraged telework to reduce space by implementing unassigned workstations in nearly all of its regional and headquarters offices, along with other forms of “employee mobility,” complementary IT, and smaller space standards. GSA adopted telework as early as 1999 and by fiscal year 2015, more than 90 percent of all eligible GSA employees teleworked, and nearly half of all employees teleworked 3 or more days per pay period, according to OPM data. GSA’s space policy cites desk-sharing (e.g., hoteling, “hot-desking,” or other arrangements) as one strategy to help meet its space standard of 136 useable square feet (USF) per person. GSA employees may telework full-time, but may be required to give up dedicated workstations if they are on site 2 or fewer days per week. GSA has gradually transitioned to unassigned workstations at headquarters and in its regional offices, allowing the agency to implement desk-sharing and calculate space needs at less than one desk per employee. The agency also assigned laptops and mobile or soft phones to employees to further maximize mobility. The three GSA sites we visited used space-planning strategies to achieve, or nearly achieve, GSA’s space standard of 136 USF per person. For example, at its Philadelphia Regional Office, GSA leveraged existing telework levels to meet reduced space standards and move to a smaller leased space by accommodating about 600 employees in fewer than 500 workstations. According to GSA, this allowed the office to achieve a utilization rate of 139 USF per person and realize a reported annual rent cost savings of about $2 million. Similarly, at its New York Regional Office, GSA also leveraged existing telework levels to meet reduced space standards and move to a smaller leased space. This step allowed the office to achieve a utilization rate of 119 USF per person and realize a reported total rent cost savings of nearly $11 million. GSA also leveraged telework as part of its headquarters consolidation. GSA reports that it was able to move approximately 1,000 additional employees to the headquarters building by implementing a hoteling system and planning for less than one workstation per employee. This allowed GSA to achieve a utilization rate of 138 USF per person at its headquarters and realize a reported annual rent-cost savings of approximately $24 million. Similar to GSA, OJP used telework, along with complementary tools, to reduce space and use space more efficiently at its consolidated office. More than 90 percent of eligible employees teleworked in fiscal year 2015, and nearly half of all employees teleworked 3 or more days per pay period, according to OPM data. More recently, OJP reported that around 70 percent of its employees teleworked in August 2017, with just less than 40 percent doing so three or more days per pay period. At the departmental level, DOJ’s plans to improve space utilization include reduced space requirements, and, in some cases, alternative workplace strategies. DOJ’s space utilization policy mentions telework with hoteling as one way to increase efficient use of space, and DOJ’s telework policy mentions the potential of telework to create cost savings by decreasing space needs. While most OJP employees are eligible to telework, a few federal staff occupying administrative positions are not eligible. OJP took the opportunity to examine and improve its space use as three of its leases approached expiration in 2013. It leased space in two adjacent buildings under three separate leases. OJP worked with GSA to analyze space-planning options, contracting a study of the office that recommended ways to improve space utilization. This study included a survey of all employees, a complete physical space survey, and interviews with leadership. The results of this study not only indicated OJP employees’ openness to more mobility but also that they had concerns such as loss of privacy and social connectedness. For example, more than 80 percent of survey respondents said they could work off-site more often with proper tools and support, and almost half said they would give up dedicated space to work remotely more often. Furthermore, interviews with the leadership of several OJP units indicated a willingness to support increased mobility but also a need to maintain privacy and improve mobile IT. According to OJP, it alleviated these concerns by encouraging participation in the planning process, highlighting opportunities for positive changes, and maintaining open communication (e.g., communicating changes and expected benefits). Based on the analysis of space-planning options, OJP retained one of the three previous leases and leveraged telework to accommodate all employees into less space overall in one building. OJP achieved this objective by targeting 25 percent employee mobility and implementing hoteling. Concurrently, OJP officials explained that they introduced smaller workstations and used tenant-improvement allowance funds to reconfigure space for more flexible use. Physical reconfigurations included changing hard-walled office spaces with dedicated workstations to a primarily open office with few walls or dedicated workstations. According to OJP, it complemented these changes with investments in mobile IT for individual employees, improved IT capabilities in conference rooms and other collaborative spaces, and an emphasis on training employees to work well in a mobile office environment. For example, OJP officials said they installed Wi-Fi throughout the space, issued laptops and smart phones to employees, upgraded video-conferencing capabilities in conference rooms and collaborative spaces, and expanded tools for informal employee communication. According to OJP officials, through the consolidation, they said they achieved a utilization rate of 190 USF per person—a decrease of 30 USF per person from the prior 220 utilization rate. This rate remained higher than DOJ’s overall target and housed the same total number of employees—about 1,000—in about 50,000 fewer USF. OJP reports that the consolidation resulted in an estimated $3 million annual lease- cost savings. OJP also estimates additional savings from reduced transit subsidies, carbon emissions, and continuity of operations. Relative to GSA and OJP, CDC has made more limited use of telework in office space-planning. CDC officials told us that they have leveraged telework as a space-planning tool in many locations, but they have only documented doing so in one case. HHS expects each sub-agency to comply with its 170 USF per-person utilization-rate policy, and this policy suggests that planned space reductions should take telework into account. As a component of HHS, CDC has its own space policy, which states that telework, desk-sharing, and hoteling can help CDC’s units meet HHS’s utilization rate policy of 170 USF per person. CDC’s telework policy requires employees who telework frequently to agree to participate in desk-sharing, but according to CDC officials, how and to what extent this portion of the broader policy is implemented is up to the discretion of management. CDC officials cited two limitations to further implementing space sharing techniques: (1) the large number of employees’ who may be unable to telework on certain days based upon their job responsibilities and (2) the voluntary nature of telework. Some CDC employees cannot work off-site at least some of the time due to confidential data or lab-based work. Approximately 60 percent of eligible CDC employees teleworked in fiscal year 2015 and about one-quarter of all employees teleworked 3 or more days per pay period, according to OPM data. CDC officials told us that telework participation ranges from 49 to 86 percent across CDC units. CDC’s National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion’s office in Chamblee, GA, provides the most clearly documented case of CDC’s leveraging telework for space efficiency. According to CDC officials, this unit accommodated more than 300 additional employees within its existing space by implementing hoteling for employees who telework 4 or more days per pay period, and it continues to use hoteling as part of its space management strategy. In contrast, CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics’ (NCHS) office in Hyattsville, MD, reduced space without leveraging telework by reconfiguring the space with smaller, soft-walled workstations. CDC officials told us that NCHS reduced its office space from seven floors to three and three-quarters floors, resulting in a reported space reduction of more than 40 percent and allowing it to achieve a 170 USF per person utilization rate. CDC officials reported that this space reduction resulted in annual rent cost savings of approximately $1 million. Hoteling was not feasible at this location because work on confidential data limits the ability of employees to work off-site, and NCHS employees also prefer dedicated workstations. CDC officials said that there is limited documentation of any additional cases of CDC’s leveraging telework as a space- planning tool because, prior to our review, there had been no formal request to connect telework and space utilization data. In contrast to GSA, OJP, and CDC, telework as a space-planning tool is an emerging consideration at the Fiscal Service. At the departmental level, Treasury has space standards that aim for efficient and effective offices that use increased telework and shared workstations to minimize the number of dedicated workstations. Similarly, objectives of the Fiscal Service telework policy include cost savings from reduced office space needs. Treasury’s space standards specify a planned maximum utilization rate of 200 USF per person for facilities with general office space, and the Fiscal Service reported that its average office space-utilization rate was 183 USF per person at the time of our review. Treasury policy also recommends hoteling for employees who are out of the office 80 or more hours per month, but the Fiscal Service told us that it would like to conduct additional desk-sharing pilots to assess their impact before negotiating broader desk-sharing with the union. At the Fiscal Service, approximately 80 percent of eligible employees teleworked in fiscal year 2015, and about one-quarter of all employees teleworked 3 or more days per pay period, according to OPM data. The Fiscal Service reported that approximately 80 percent of Fiscal Service employees telework at its Washington, D.C., Maryland, and West Virginia locations. At the time of our review, the Fiscal Service officials said the agency had reduced space without leveraging telework or implementing hoteling, instead relying on smaller space standards (i.e., fewer square feet per workstation) to lease smaller offices. For example, the Fiscal Service reduced space by giving up several floors at its Hyattsville, MD, office starting in 2012. According to Fiscal Service officials, they accomplished these reductions by consolidating data centers to other locations, conducting targeted buyouts of employees, and, most recently, by implementing a new space standard of 183 USF per person through smaller workstations. The officials said that the most recent space reduction at this location resulted in savings in annual rent costs not attributable to telework. Looking forward, the Fiscal Service reported that it has started taking preliminary steps to promote efficient space utilization through telework. These steps have included: creating an Executive Space Management Council that discussed incorporating telework and desk-sharing into space management guidelines; implementing a voluntary, informal desk-sharing pilot in one program area for employees who already telework 50 percent or more of the time; and seeking information from GSA, including discussing and visiting GSA offices that have implemented hoteling as part of their space planning model. In addition, the Fiscal Service officials told us that the agency plans to negotiate the impact and implementation of desk-sharing and hoteling for telework employees with its union, but the Fiscal Service has not yet begun this effort. Our analysis of the survey responses from the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies identified three major planning challenges agencies face with using telework to reduce space: human capital issues such as negotiating workspace changes with collective bargaining units and managing organizational change; the suitability of telework to mission work requirements; and difficulty measuring cost savings that might result from space reductions attributable to telework. This measuring difficulty may include both gross savings as well as savings net of costs, such as for renovations or IT investments. See table 3 for examples of space-planning challenges related to telework reported by the 23 agencies. To address these challenges, nearly two thirds of the agencies we surveyed reported they would like guidance on using telework programs or other alternatives to meet the federal goals of reducing space or using space more efficiently. Our review of agency survey responses, Real Property Efficiency Plans, and other agency space-planning documents, found that human capital challenges to using telework in space planning generally fell into two categories: (1) requirements to negotiate space allocation changes with collective-bargaining units; and (2) managing department workforces in adapting to new workspace designs and altered workspace allocations. Collective-bargaining challenges: Of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies, 7 of 23 noted that changes to telework policy or workspace arrangements required negotiation with collective bargaining units, for example, The Small Business Administration (SBA) reported its greatest challenge to incorporating telework in office space planning has been with negotiating and securing agreement from all parties, including management and its union, on establishing space standards. HUD reported that it could not implement hoteling or desk-sharing as its collective-bargaining agreements require that each employee retain an assigned workstation regardless of an employee’s type of telework agreement. SSA reported that changing floor plans required negotiation with its three collective-bargaining units, which could extend the time needed for construction and relocation. DOT reported that collective-bargaining agreements posed a challenge to incorporating workforce mobility options, including telework. In addition, the collective-bargaining agreements we reviewed from the four agencies we reviewed in detail––GSA, OJP, CDC and Fiscal Service––required negotiations or the opportunity to negotiate changes to matters relating to workspace arrangements and in some cases, to telework policy. Managing change: Using telework as a strategic space-planning tool, particularly in conjunction with complementary space-saving efforts such as desk-sharing, hoteling, or open-space designs, generally involves a cultural change. Nine of the 23 agencies we surveyed reported challenges associated with managing change. For example, three agencies reported employees’ discomfort or apprehension about desk-sharing and hoteling. In 2013, we reported that organizations may also encounter concerns from agency leaders, managers, employees, or employee organizations when introducing physical space changes associated with increased workforce mobility (telework). More recently, we reported that management concerns remain the most frequently reported barrier to expanding telework. Two private sector experts we met with underscored the importance of management “buy-in” saying it was imperative that senior executives fully support the initiative to facilitate the necessary cultural change for agencies to use telework in space planning. One noted that management needed to make the business case to employees so that each layer of the organization could understand the importance of the initiative and its potential benefits. Another suggested a change management plan tailored to the work performed within a unit. This individual said that key components of such a plan might include studying existing work practices and program requirements, surveying employee preferences, and including employees in the planning process. Further, a GSA document circulated in response to the Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 mentions obtaining supervisory “buy-in” or support as key to facilitating change. According to survey responses, within agencies there are sub-agencies that have individual mission requirements that may or may not be suitable for telework. This makes it difficult for agencies to implement overarching telework and space planning policies that apply department-wide. Sub- agencies and units within sub-agencies must individually determine if telework is appropriate given their particular mission requirements. For example, the Veterans Administration reported that although it developed an agency-wide telework policy, each sub-agency and supervisor has the flexibility to implement telework based on operational needs. Moreover, because the agency’s core mission involves direct services to veterans, about 83 percent of agency staff positions are not suitable for telework. The Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 outlines two broad exceptions to telework participation for employees: (1) directly handling secure materials determined to be inappropriate for telework by the agency head and (2) on-site activity that cannot be handled remotely or at an alternative worksite. In cases where telework does not support an agency’s mission or where a particular mission may require increases or decreases in personnel, telework as a strategic space-planning tool may not work. About half (12 of 23) of the agencies we surveyed reported that office space reductions resulting from using telework in space planning led to real estate cost savings while the other half reported either that cost savings did not result or they did not know. GSA officials told us that calculating cost savings attributable to a particular aspect of space planning is complicated as several factors contribute to savings. In particular, in survey responses, the Departments of Education, Energy, and Agriculture reiterated this point. OMB’s National Strategy for the Efficient Use of Real Property and its Reduce the Footprint policy encourage agencies to increase and maximize efficiencies in office space by implementing cost-effective strategies such as telework. For example, the National Strategy outlines a framework that aims to measure real property costs and utilization to improve the efficient use of federal real property. The Reduce the Footprint policy requires agencies to measure cost savings that result from reducing space through disposals. However, neither document offers guidance or methodologies on how to measure the costs or savings that may result from using telework. We previously reported that GSA works with client agencies to develop tools to measure office space utilization and, in 2013, was developing an Excel-based tool to help agencies quantify the benefits and costs of using telework to achieve greater office space efficiencies. This tool—the Workplace Investment and Feasibility Tool—is aimed at helping agencies quantify the benefits and costs of increased telework participation and implementing other alternative-work arrangements. When completed, the tool will enable users to quickly develop rough estimates of cost and space impacts resulting from workplace changes, particularly relating to desk-sharing, workspace reconfiguration, and consolidation. Key features include the ability to compare up to three scenarios, which in turn may be used to inform a more detailed design program. As of January 2018, GSA had not yet completed the tool. GSA officials said mission needs, resource constraints, and developmental adjustments have contributed to delays in the time frame for completing the tool. They added that during this time, GSA has diverted resources to space calculation tools for individual agencies. For example, GSA worked with DHS on its Space Calculation Tool as a way to help determine workplace space requirements in a manner consistent with DHS space policies. In January 2018, GSA officials told us that they plan to make the Workplace Investment and Feasibility Tool available to GSA staff in March 2018 along with training on how to use it. However, GSA officials have not decided whether to make the tool available to other federal agencies to use as a space-planning tool. Instead, the officials plan to assess GSA’s use of the tool and then determine in late 2018 if and how it should be released to other agencies for independent use. Given the absence of a government-wide tool, in our review, we found that some agencies had used their own resources to purchase similar tools for their space-planning needs from the private sector. Without such a government-wide resource, agencies may not be able to determine how best to reduce space or use it more efficiently. In responses to our survey, nearly two-thirds of agencies reported that they would find it helpful to have additional information, assistance, or resources to assist them in using telework as a space-planning tool. As noted above, a key element of GSA’s mission is to provide guidance and services that enable agencies to improve space utilization, reduce costs, and better achieve their missions. Moreover, under federal statute, GSA may provide guidance to executive agencies on the implementation of alternative workplace arrangements, which includes telework. Federal standards for internal control also call for agencies to communicate necessary quality information such as guidance with external parties. In reviewing GSA’s websites, we found that GSA last developed formal guidance on alternative workplace arrangements in 2006 and maintains several separate informational websites on implementing telework and optimizing space utilization. Our review of this guidance and these websites found that they do not provide specific guidance for using telework as a strategic space-planning tool. For example, the 2006 guidance is generally limited to defining the factors agency heads must contemplate when considering alternative workplace arrangements along with the equipment and technical services agencies may provide for alternative worksites. However, this guidance does not address in detail the impact of such arrangements on agency office space and resulting planning issues. Similarly, our review of GSA’s teleworking and space- planning websites found that although they separately offered documented case studies along with information such as tips for implementing telework and managing a mobile workforce, GSA did not provide documents consolidating the concept of using telework as a strategic space-planning tool. For example, information on GSA’s Total Workplace Program website––intended to assist agencies in using workforce mobility (including telework) to increase space efficiencies––is generally limited. Although this website includes high-level information that describes the potential benefits of using telework with office space planning and design, it lacks a practical outline of the process agencies might use to achieve them. Because the information in the 2006 guidance and the telework and space-planning websites is neither specific nor detailed, it is of limited assistance for agencies that would like to use telework as a strategic space-planning tool to meet the goals of a more efficient use of space. While using telework to reduce space is not a new challenge, it has become more pressing with OMB’s requirement for federal agencies to explore alternatives to acquiring more office space. Most civilian CFO Act agencies reported having a telework program in place and some reported success with using it in space planning to reduce space or accommodate more employees without increasing space. However, many of the agencies continue to face challenges and do not believe that they have adequate information, assistance, or resources to assist them in using telework as a space-planning tool or assess its costs and benefits. Until agencies have access to detailed guidance and tools to help utilize various space-planning options, they may not be able to effectively identify opportunities to use telework toward the goal of reducing their real property footprint. We are making the following two recommendations to GSA: The Administrator of General Services should ensure that the appropriate GSA offices develop guidance including, but not limited to, how agencies can use telework as a strategic space-planning tool for reducing and optimizing office space efficiency and that the offices make the guidance readily available. (Recommendation 1) The Administrator of General Services should ensure the appropriate GSA offices complete the Workplace Investment and Feasibility Tool and make it available to federal agencies for use in assessing the benefits and costs of telework to achieve office space efficiencies. (Recommendation 2) We provided a draft of this report to GSA, the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of the Treasury. In its written comments, reproduced in Appendix III, GSA concurred with our recommendations and stated that it is developing a plan to address them. We received technical comments from the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services, which we incorporated where appropriate. The Department of the Treasury did not have comments on our draft report. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees; the Administrator of GSA; and the Secretaries of the Department of Health and Human Services and Department of the Treasury, and the Attorney General of the Department of Justice. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff has any questions concerning this report, please contact me at (202) 512-2834 or rectanusl@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff that made key contributions to this report is listed in appendix III. This report addresses: (1) how the 23 civilian Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act agencies reported using telework in office space planning; (2) the specific ways selected agencies and GSA used telework in their office space planning; and (3) any challenges the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies faced in using telework in office space planning. To determine how the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies reported using telework in office space planning, we surveyed the agencies. The survey asked questions about agency-wide efforts to use telework in the human- capital and space-planning areas; whether agencies had achieved any cost savings as a result; the challenges agencies faced in using telework in space planning; and asked agencies to identify additional information, resources, or guidance that might be helpful. In addition to the survey questions, we asked each agency real property officer to provide copies of agency-wide space-planning documents and the Real Property Efficiency Plans agencies prepared for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 pursuant to the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) Reduce the Footprint policy. We developed survey questions based on our review of the relevant literature, white papers from federal agencies and private sector entities, and past GAO reports. We pre- tested the survey instrument with three federal agencies to ascertain: (1) the clarity of survey questions; (2) the precision of language; and 3) the availability of information queried. As a result of the pre-tests we made changes to the content and format of the survey where appropriate. We received survey responses from each of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies in addition to requested space-planning documents and Real Property Efficiency Plans, and thus achieved a 100 percent response rate. We analyzed survey results by calculating the frequency of responses to dichotomous questions (i.e., questions requiring a “yes” or “no” answer). We also conducted a content analysis on the open-ended, narrative-based questions by identifying common themes and tabulating results. We also conducted a content analysis to determine the extent to which agencies referenced telework in their agency-wide space-planning documents and in their Real Property Efficiency Plans. To accomplish these analyses, we developed separate coding schemes for each of the two types of documents. These were based on information obtained in our literature review, interviews with subject matter experts, and our professional judgment. We then identified relevant sections and common themes, and coded and tabulated the results. To validate the coding results, we used a second, independent coder. To determine the specific ways agencies include telework in their office space planning, we selected a non-generalizable sample of three CFO Act agency sub-agencies as illustrative case studies. To select sub- agencies, we analyzed data from the Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) Public Use 2014-2015 Telework Data call. First, we applied two selection criteria: (1) agency-wide progress toward a stated goal of using telework to reduce real estate costs, and (2) agency-reported data indicating that more than 25 percent of sub-agency employees teleworked 3 or more days per pay period. Next, we considered variations in sub-agency size and percentage of employees eligible to telework. Finally, we excluded candidates that had recently been selected for related GAO work and we excluded sub-agencies related to agency administration such as Offices of Inspector General or Secretary-level offices. We assessed the reliability of the OPM’s data by interviews with knowledgeable officials and by reviewing prior assessments of the same data, and we found the data reliable for our purposes. As a result of this process, we selected (1) the Department of the Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service); (2) the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); and (3) the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs (OJP). For each of the selected agencies, we interviewed agency officials and reviewed their telework and space- planning documents. We also visited four sub-agency office locations to determine if and how telework played a role in any space reductions or efficiencies along with any associated cost savings. In addition to these three sub-agencies, we used the General Services Administration (GSA) as a comparative example since it is responsible for providing space- planning guidance to client agencies and has experience using telework in space planning. We interviewed GSA officials, reviewed relevant documents, and visited three GSA office locations with recent space reductions or efficiencies. In total, we conducted seven site visits including two Fiscal Service locations, one location each for CDC and OJP, and three GSA locations (National Headquarters, Region 2 Office, and Region 3 Office) in Washington, D.C.; New York City; and Philadelphia, respectively. To identify any challenges the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies faced in using telework in office space planning, we analyzed results from survey questions addressed to challenges, interviewed sub-agency and GSA officials as detailed above, interviewed two private sector subject matter experts, and representatives from four private-sector entities that had reported using telework to reduce and use office space more efficiently. Statements made by knowledgeable federal officials, outside experts and private sector entities are not generalizable to the universe of civilian CFO Act agencies. We also analyzed the section of each of the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies’ Real Property Efficiency Plans devoted to challenges agency face in reducing space. We selected the two subject matter experts––representatives from Global Workplace Analytics and Fentress Facility Planning and Analytics––based on: (1) their experience working with federal agencies to incorporate telework programs into the space planning process; (2) information compiled in our literature review; (3) prior GAO reports; (4) internal GAO recommendations; and (5) industry recommendations. We selected the four private sector entities (AT&T, Deloitte, Adobe, and CapitalOne) based on our literature review, recommendations from industry experts, and reports of having achieved space efficiencies including space reduction, cost savings, or cost avoidance(s). To identify what guidance or information on using telework as a space- planning tool GSA makes available through its website, we reviewed the contents of multiple GSA websites including Telework, Total Workplace, Alternative Work, and GSA Telework Resources. We followed links and reviewed webpage contents for information on how agencies might use telework as a strategic tool to reduce space or use space more efficiently. We compared GSA’s guidance and website information to relevant statutory requirements and federal internal controls standards related to external communication. We conducted this performance audit from January 2017 to March 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. In addition to the contact named above, David J.

GAO was asked to examine the effects of telework on agencies' space-planning efforts. In this report, GAO reviewed: (1) how the 23 civilian CFO Act agencies reported using telework in office space planning; (2) the specific ways selected agencies and GSA used telework in their office space planning; and (3) any challenges the civilian CFO Act agencies faced in using telework in office space planning. GAO surveyed all 23 civilian CFO Act agencies, analyzed each agency's space-planning documents, and Real Property Efficiency Plans . GAO reviewed four agencies in greater detail based on analysis of telework data and other factors. For those four agencies GAO conducted site visits, interviewed officials, and analyzed agency documents. GAO also identified challenges agencies faced in using telework in space planning, based on survey results, agency documents, and interviews. The 23 civilian Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act agencies reported various ways of considering and using telework as a space-planning tool, by, for example, implementing desk-sharing for employees who telework in order to relinquish leased space, or increasing the number of staff working in an existing space without increasing its size. All of the 23 agencies discussed telework in the context of space planning and achieving greater space efficiencies in either their space-planning documents or Real Property Efficiency Plans . The agencies that used telework as a space-planning tool generally reported implementing smaller or unassigned workstations. Three of the four agencies GAO reviewed in greater detail––the General Services Administration (GSA); the Office of Justice Programs at the Department of Justice; the Centers for Disease Control at the Department of Health and Human Services; and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service at the Department of the Treasury––leveraged telework to reduce or use office space more efficiently. For example, GSA and the Office of Justice Programs used telework to accommodate more employees in a smaller office space as illustrated in figure 1 below. The Centers for Disease Control used telework to accommodate more employees in the same amount of space. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service reduced space without telework by reducing the size of individual workstations. The 23 civilian CFO Act agencies reported several challenges in using telework to reduce space including human capital issues, mission suitability, and measuring cost savings attributable to telework. About two-thirds of the agencies said they would find it helpful to have additional information, assistance, or resources in using telework as a space-planning tool. GSA provides guidance to improve space utilization. However, GAO found that GSA last developed relevant formal guidance in 2006. This information, and that on GSA's telework and space-planning websites, was neither specific nor detailed and therefore of limited assistance to agencies that would like to use telework as a space-planning tool. Additionally, GSA's space-planning tool—the Workplace Investment and Feasibility Tool, intended to help agencies quantify the benefits and costs of telework––remains under development after more than 4 years, and GSA officials have not decided whether to make the tool available to other federal agencies. As such, agencies reported that they lack adequate guidance to determine how best to reduce space or use it more efficiently, and how to assess the benefits and costs of using telework in space planning. GSA concurred with recommendations that GSA should: (1) develop guidance on how agencies can use telework as a strategic space-planning tool and make this guidance readily available and (2) complete and make the Workplace Investment and Feasibility Tool available to federal agencies for use in assessing the benefits and costs of telework.""]","6903","gov_report","en","None","780de001e250947c102e770515de8b924ff9ee35597b7533","Summary:","gov_report","532","\nThe report examines how 23 civilian Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act agencies use telework Enhancement Act of 2010. The Act establishes telework implementation requirements for agencies, including the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to assess agency-established telework outcome goals, and the OPM to submit reports on agency-wide telework participation rates and space-eligibility. The report also identifies human capital and space-planning challenges, and discusses the challenges faced by agencies face in using telework as a strategic space-planning tool. The report concludes that using telework has not been fully utilized as a strategic space-planning tool, and that agencies need additional guidance and resources and information to effectively use telework as a space-planning tool."
"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nIT systems supporting federal agencies and our nation’s critical infrastructures are inherently at risk. These systems are highly complex and dynamic, technologically diverse, and often geographically dispersed. This complexity increases the difficulty in identifying, managing, and protecting the numerous operating systems, applications, and devices comprising the systems and networks. Compounding the risk, federal systems and networks are also often interconnected with other internal and external systems and networks, including the Internet. This increases the number of avenues of attack and expands their attack surface. As systems become more integrated, cyber threats will pose an increasing risk to national security, economic well-being, and public health and safety. Advancements in technology, such as data analytics software for searching and collecting information, have also made it easier for individuals and organizations to correlate data (including PII) and track it across large and numerous databases. For example, social media has been used as a mass communication tool where PII can be gathered in vast amounts. In addition, ubiquitous Internet and cellular connectivity makes it easier to track individuals by allowing easy access to information pinpointing their locations. These advances—combined with the increasing sophistication of hackers and others with malicious intent, and the extent to which both federal agencies and private companies collect sensitive information about individuals—have increased the risk of PII being exposed and compromised. Cybersecurity incidents continue to impact entities across various critical infrastructure sectors. For example, in its 2018 annual data breach investigations report, Verizon reported that 53,308 security incidents and 2,216 data breaches were identified across 65 countries in the 12 months since its prior report. Further, the report noted that cybercriminals can often compromise a system in just a matter of minutes—or even seconds, but that it can take an organization significantly longer to discover the breach. Specifically, the report stated nearly 90 percent of the reported breaches occurred within minutes, while nearly 70 percent went undiscovered for months. These concerns are further highlighted by the number of information security incidents reported by federal executive branch civilian agencies to DHS’s U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT). For fiscal year 2017, 35,277 such incidents were reported by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in its 2018 annual report to Congress, as mandated by the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA). These incidents include, for example, web-based attacks, phishing, and the loss or theft of computing equipment. Different types of incidents merit different response strategies. However, if an agency cannot identify the threat vector (or avenue of attack), it could be difficult for that agency to define more specific handling procedures to respond to the incident and take actions to minimize similar future attacks. In this regard, incidents with a threat vector categorized as “other” (which includes avenues of attacks that are unidentified) made up 31 percent of the various incidents reported to US-CERT. Figure 1 shows the percentage of the different types of incidents reported across each of the nine threat vector categories for fiscal year 2017, as reported by OMB. These incidents and others like them can pose a serious challenge to economic, national, and personal privacy and security. The following examples highlight the impact of such incidents: In March 2018, the Mayor of Atlanta, Georgia, reported that the city was victimized by a ransomware cyberattack. As a result, city government officials stated that customers were not able to access multiple applications that are used to pay bills or access court related information. In response to the attack, the officials noted that they were working with numerous private and governmental partners, including DHS, to assess what occurred and determine how best to protect the city from future attacks. In March 2018, the Department of Justice reported that it had indicted nine Iranians for conducting a massive cybersecurity theft campaign on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. According to the department, the nine Iranians allegedly stole more than 31 terabytes of documents and data from more than 140 American universities, 30 U.S. companies, and five federal government agencies, among other entities. In March 2018, a joint alert from DHS and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) stated that, since at least March 2016, Russian government actors had targeted the systems of multiple U.S. government entities and critical infrastructure sectors. Specifically, the alert stated that Russian government actors had affected multiple organizations in the energy, nuclear, water, aviation, construction, and critical manufacturing sectors. In July 2017, a breach at Equifax resulted in the loss of PII for an estimated 148 million U.S. consumers. According to Equifax, the hackers accessed people’s names, Social Security numbers (SSN), birth dates, addresses and, in some instances, driver’s license numbers. In April 2017, the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) testified that the IRS had disabled its data retrieval tool in early March 2017 after becoming concerned about the misuse of taxpayer data. Specifically, the agency suspected that PII obtained outside the agency’s tax system was used to access the agency’s online federal student aid application in an attempt to secure tax information through the data retrieval tool. In April 2017, the agency began notifying taxpayers who could have been affected by the breach. In June 2015, OPM reported that an intrusion into its systems had affected the personnel records of about 4.2 million current and former federal employees. Then, in July 2015, the agency reported that a separate, but related, incident had compromised its systems and the files related to background investigations for 21.5 million individuals. In total, OPM estimated 22.1 million individuals had some form of PII stolen, with 3.6 million being a victim of both breaches. Safeguarding federal IT systems and the systems that support critical infrastructures has been a long-standing concern of GAO. Due to increasing cyber-based threats and the persistent nature of information security vulnerabilities, we have designated information security as a government-wide high-risk area since 1997. In 2003, we expanded the information security high-risk area to include the protection of critical cyber infrastructure. At that time, we highlighted the need to manage critical infrastructure protection activities that enhance the security of the cyber and physical public and private infrastructures that are essential to national security, national economic security, and/or national public health and safety. We further expanded the information security high-risk area in 2015 to include protecting the privacy of PII. Since then, advances in technology have enhanced the ability of government and private sector entities to collect and process extensive amounts of PII, which has posed challenges to ensuring the privacy of such information. In addition, high- profile PII breaches at commercial entities, such as Equifax, heightened concerns that personal privacy is not being adequately protected. Our experience has shown that the key elements needed to make progress toward being removed from the High-Risk List are top-level attention by the administration and agency leaders grounded in the five criteria for removal, as well as any needed congressional action. The five criteria for removal that we identified in November 2000 are as follows: Leadership Commitment. Demonstrated strong commitment and top leadership support. Capacity. The agency has the capacity (i.e., people and resources) to resolve the risk(s). Action Plan. A corrective action plan exists that defines the root cause, solutions, and provides for substantially completing corrective measures, including steps necessary to implement solutions we recommended. Monitoring. A program has been instituted to monitor and independently validate the effectiveness and sustainability of corrective measures. Demonstrated Progress. Ability to demonstrate progress in implementing corrective measures and in resolving the high-risk area. These five criteria form a road map for efforts to improve and ultimately address high-risk issues. Addressing some of the criteria leads to progress, while satisfying all of the criteria is central to removal from the list. Figure 2 shows the five criteria and illustrative actions taken by agencies to address the criteria. Importantly, the actions listed are not “stand alone” efforts taken in isolation from other actions to address high- risk issues. That is, actions taken under one criterion may be important to meeting other criteria as well. For example, top leadership can demonstrate its commitment by establishing a corrective action plan including long-term priorities and goals to address the high-risk issue and using data to gauge progress—actions which are also vital to monitoring criteria. As we reported in the February 2017 high-risk report, the federal government’s efforts to address information security deficiencies had fully met one of the five criteria for removal from the High-Risk List— leadership commitment—and partially met the other four, as shown in figure 3. We plan to update our assessment of this high-risk area against the five criteria in February 2019. Based on our prior work, we have identified four major cybersecurity challenges: (1) establishing a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy and performing effective oversight, (2) securing federal systems and information, (3) protecting cyber critical infrastructure, and (4) protecting privacy and sensitive data. To address these challenges, we have identified 10 critical actions that the federal government and other entities need to take (see figure 4). The four challenges and the 10 actions needed to address them are summarized following the table. In addition, we also discuss in more detail each of the 10 actions in appendices II through XI. The federal government has been challenged in establishing a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy and in performing effective oversight as called for by federal law and policy. Specifically, we have previously reported that the federal government has faced challenges in establishing a comprehensive strategy to provide a framework for how the United States will engage both domestically and internationally on cybersecurity related matters. We have also reported on challenges in performing oversight, including monitoring the global supply chain, ensuring a highly skilled cyber workforce, and addressing risks associated with emerging technologies. The federal government can take four key actions to improve the nation’s strategic approach to, and oversight of, cybersecurity. Develop and execute a more comprehensive federal strategy for national cybersecurity and global cyberspace. In February 2013 we reported that the government had issued a variety of strategy- related documents that addressed priorities for enhancing cybersecurity within the federal government as well as for encouraging improvements in the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure within the private sector; however, no overarching cybersecurity strategy had been developed that articulated priority actions, assigned responsibilities for performing them, and set time frames for their completion. In October 2015, in response to our recommendation to develop an overarching federal cybersecurity strategy that included all key elements of the desirable characteristics of a national strategy, the Director of OMB and the Federal Chief Information Officer issued a Cybersecurity Strategy and Implementation Plan for the Federal Civilian Government. The plan directed a series of actions to improve capabilities for identifying and detecting vulnerabilities and threats, enhance protections of government assets and information, and further develop robust response and recovery capabilities to ensure readiness and resilience when incidents inevitably occur. The plan also identified key milestones for major activities, resources needed to accomplish milestones, and specific roles and responsibilities of federal organizations related to the strategy’s milestones. Since that time, the executive branch has made progress toward outlining a federal strategy for confronting cyber threats. For example, a May 2017 presidential executive order required federal agencies to take a variety of actions, including better manage their cybersecurity risks and coordinate to meet reporting requirements related to cybersecurity of federal networks, critical infrastructure, and the nation. Additionally, the December 2017 National Security Strategy cites cybersecurity as a national priority and identifies related needed actions, such as including identifying and prioritizing risk, and building defensible government networks. Further, DHS issued a cybersecurity strategy in May 2018, which articulated seven goals the department plans to accomplish in support of its mission related to managing national cybersecurity risks. The strategy is intended to provide DHS with a framework to execute its cybersecurity responsibilities during the next 5 years to keep pace with the evolving cyber risk landscape by reducing vulnerabilities and building resilience; countering malicious actors in cyberspace; responding to incidents; and making the cyber ecosystem more secure and resilient. These efforts provide a good foundation toward establishing a more comprehensive strategy, but more effort is needed to address all of the desirable characteristics of a national strategy that we have previously recommended. The recently issued executive branch strategy documents did not include key elements of desirable characteristics that can enhance the usefulness of a national strategy as guidance for decision makers in allocating resources, defining policies, and helping to ensure accountability. Specifically, the documents generally did not include milestones and performance measures to gauge results, nor did they describe the resources needed to carry out the goals and objective. Further, most of the strategy documents lacked clearly defined roles and responsibilities for key agencies, such as DHS, the Department of Defense (DOD), and OMB, who contribute substantially to the nation’s cybersecurity programs. Ultimately, a more clearly defined, coordinated, and comprehensive approach to planning and executing an overall strategy would likely lead to significant progress in furthering strategic goals and lessening persistent weaknesses. For more information on this action area, see appendix II. Mitigate global supply chain risks. The global, geographically disperse nature of the producers and suppliers of IT products is a growing concern. We have previously reported on potential issues associated with IT supply chain and risks originating from foreign- manufactured equipment. For example, in July 2017, we reported that the Department of State had relied on certain device manufacturers, software developers, and contractor support which had suppliers that were reported to be headquartered in a cyber-threat nation (e.g., China and Russia). We further pointed out that the reliance on complex, global IT supply chains introduces multiple risks to federal agencies, including insertion of counterfeits, tampering, or installation of malicious software or hardware. In July 2018, we testified that if such global IT supply chain risks are realized, they could jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of federal information systems. Thus, the potential exists for serious adverse impact on an agency’s operations, assets, and employees. These factors highlight the importance and urgency of federal agencies appropriately assessing, managing, and monitoring IT supply chain risk as part of their agency-wide information security programs. For more information on this action area, see appendix III. Address cybersecurity workforce management challenges. The federal government faces challenges in ensuring that the nation’s cybersecurity workforce has the appropriate skills. For example, in June 2018, we reported on federal efforts to implement the requirements of the Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2015. We determined that most of the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies had not fully implemented all statutory requirements, such as developing procedures for assigning codes to cybersecurity positions. Further, we have previously reported that DHS and DOD had not addressed cybersecurity workforce management requirements set forth in federal laws. In addition, we have reported in the last 2 years that federal agencies (1) had not identified and closed cybersecurity skills gaps, (2) had been challenged with recruiting and retaining qualified staff, and (3) had difficulty navigating the federal hiring process. A recent executive branch report also discussed challenges associated with the cybersecurity workforce. Specifically, in response to Executive Order 13800, the Department of Commerce and DHS led an interagency working group exploring how to support the growth and sustainment of future cybersecurity employees in the public and private sectors. In May 2018, the departments issued a report that identified key findings, including: the U.S. cybersecurity workforce needs immediate and sustained improvements; the pool of cybersecurity candidates needs to be expanded through retraining and by increasing the participation of women, minorities, and veterans; a shortage exists of cybersecurity teachers at the primary and secondary levels, faculty in higher education, and training instructors; and comprehensive and reliable data about cybersecurity workforce position needs and education and training programs are lacking. The report also included recommendations and proposed actions to address the findings, including that private and public sectors should (1) align education and training with employers’ cybersecurity workforce needs by applying the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education Cybersecurity Workforce Framework; (2) develop cybersecurity career model paths; and (3) establish a clearinghouse of information on cybersecurity workforce development education, training, and workforce development programs and initiatives. In addition, in June 2018, the executive branch issued a government reform plan and reorganization recommendations that included, among other things, proposals for solving the federal cybersecurity workforce shortage. In particular, the plan notes that the administration intends to prioritize and accelerate ongoing efforts to reform the way that the federal government recruits, evaluates, selects, pays, and places cyber talent across the enterprise. The plan further states that, by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, all CFO Act agencies, in coordination with DHS and OMB, are to develop a critical list of vacancies across their organizations. Subsequently, OMB and DHS are to analyze these lists and work with OPM to develop a government-wide approach to identifying or recruiting new employees or reskilling existing employees. Regarding cybersecurity training, the plan notes that OMB is to consult with DHS to standardize training for cybersecurity employees, and should work to develop an enterprise-wide training process for government cybersecurity employees. For more information on this action area, see appendix IV. Ensure the security of emerging technologies. As the devices used in daily life become increasingly integrated with technology, the risk to sensitive data and PII also grows. Over the last several years, we have reported on weaknesses in addressing vulnerabilities associated with emerging technologies, including: IoT devices, such as fitness trackers, cameras, and thermostats, that continuously collect and process information are potentially vulnerable to cyber-attacks; IoT devices, such as those acquired and used by DOD employees or that DOD itself acquires (e.g., smartphones), may increase the security risks to the department; vehicles that are potentially susceptible to cyber-attack through technology, such as Bluetooth; the unknown impact of artificial intelligence cybersecurity; and advances in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies. Executive branch agencies have also highlighted the challenges associated with ensuring the security of emerging technologies. Specifically, in a May 2018 report issued in response to Executive Order 13800, the Department of Commerce and DHS issued a report on the opportunities and challenges in reducing the botnet threat. The opportunities and challenges are centered on six principal themes, including the global nature of automated, distributed attacks; effective tools; and awareness and education. The report also provides recommended actions, including that federal agencies should increase their understanding of what software components have been incorporated into acquired products and establish a public campaign to support awareness of IoT security. For more information on this action area, see appendix V. In our previously discussed reports related to this cybersecurity challenge, we made a total of 50 recommendations to federal agencies to address the weaknesses identified. As of August 2018, 48 recommendations had not been implemented. These outstanding recommendations include 8 priority recommendations, meaning that we believe that they warrant priority attention from heads of key departments and agencies. These priority recommendations include addressing weaknesses associated with, among other things, agency-specific cybersecurity workforce challenges and agency responsibilities for supporting mitigation of vehicle network attacks. Until our recommendations are fully implemented, federal agencies may be limited in their ability to provide effective oversight of critical government-wide initiatives, address challenges with cybersecurity workforce management, and better ensure the security of emerging technologies. In addition to our prior work related to the federal government’s efforts to establish key strategy documents and implement effective oversight, we also have several ongoing reviews related to this challenge. These include reviews of: the CFO Act agencies’ efforts to submit complete and reliable baseline assessment reports of their cybersecurity workforces; the extent to which DOD has established training standards for cyber mission force personnel, and efforts the department has made to achieve its goal of a trained cyber mission force; and selected agencies’ ability to implement cloud service technologies and notable benefits this might have on agencies. The federal government has been challenged in securing federal systems and information. Specifically, we have reported that federal agencies have experienced challenges in implementing government-wide cybersecurity initiatives, addressing weaknesses in their information systems and responding to cyber incidents on their systems. This is particularly concerning given that the emergence of increasingly sophisticated threats and continuous reporting of cyber incidents underscores the continuing and urgent need for effective information security. As such, it is important that federal agencies take appropriate steps to better ensure they have effectively implemented programs to protect their information and systems. We have identified three actions that the agencies can take. Improve implementation of government-wide cybersecurity initiatives. Specifically, in January 2016, we reported that DHS had not ensured that the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) had fully satisfied all intended system objectives related to intrusion detection and prevention, information sharing, and analytics. In addition, in February 2017, we reported that the DHS National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center’s (NCCIC) functions were not being performed in adherence with the principles set forth in federal laws. We noted that, although NCCIC was sharing information about cyber threats in the way it should, the center did not have metrics to measure that the information was timely, relevant and actionable, as prescribed by law. For more information on this action area, see appendix VI. Address weaknesses in federal information security programs. We have previously identified a number of weaknesses in agencies’ protection of their information and information systems. For example, over the past 2 years, we have reported that: most of the 24 agencies covered by the CFO Act had weaknesses in each of the five major categories of information system controls (i.e., access controls, configuration management controls, segregation of duties, contingency planning, and agency-wide security management); three agencies—the Securities Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Food and Drug Administration—had not effectively implemented aspects of their information security programs, which resulted in weaknesses in these agencies’ security controls; information security weaknesses in selected high-impact systems at four agencies—the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, OPM, and the Department of Veterans Affairs—were cited as a key reason that the agencies had not effectively implemented elements of their information security programs; DOD’s process for monitoring the implementation of cybersecurity guidance had weaknesses and resulted in the closure of certain tasks (such as completing cyber risk assessments) before they were fully implemented; and agencies had not fully defined the role of their Chief Information Security Officers, as required by FISMA. We also recently testified that, although the government had acted to protect federal information systems, additional work was needed to improve agency security programs and cyber capabilities. In particular, we noted that further efforts were needed by agencies to implement our prior recommendations in order to strengthen their information security programs and technical controls over their computer networks and systems. For more information on this action area, see appendix VII. Enhance the federal response to cyber incidents. We have reported that certain agencies have had weaknesses in responding to cyber incidents. For example, as of August 2017, OPM had not fully implemented controls to address deficiencies identified as a result of its 2015 cyber incidents; DOD had not identified the National Guard’s cyber capabilities (e.g., computer network defense teams) or addressed challenges in its exercises; as of April 2016, DOD had not identified, clarified, or implemented all components of its support of civil authorities during cyber incidents; and as of January 2016, DHS’s NCPS had limited capabilities for detecting and preventing intrusions, conducting analytics, and sharing information. For more information on this action area, see appendix VIII. In the public versions of the reports previously discussed for this challenge area, we made a total of 101 recommendations to federal agencies to address the weaknesses identified. As of August 2018, 61 recommendations had not been implemented. These outstanding recommendations include 14 priority recommendations to address weaknesses associated with, among other things, the information security programs at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, OPM, and the Security Exchange Commission. Until these recommendations are implemented, these federal agencies will be limited in their ability to ensure the effectiveness of their programs for protecting information and systems. In addition to our prior work, we also have several ongoing reviews related to the federal government’s efforts to protect its information and systems. These include reviews of: Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) implementation, including an assessment of the implementation of the program’s authorization process for protecting federal data in cloud environments; the Equifax data breach, including an assessment of federal oversight of credit reporting agencies’ collection, use, and protection of consumer PII; the Federal Communication Commission’s Electronic Comment Filing System security, to include a review of the agency’s detection of and response to a May 2017 incident that reportedly impacted the system; DOD’s efforts to improve the cybersecurity of its major weapon DOD’s whistleblower program, including an assessment of the policies, procedures, and controls related to the access and storage of sensitive and classified information needed for the program; IRS’s efforts to (1) implement security controls and the agency’s information security program, (2) authenticate taxpayers, and (3) secure tax information; and the federal approach and strategy to securing agency information systems, to include federal intrusion detection and prevention capabilities and the intrusion assessment plan. The federal government has been challenged in working with the private sector to protect critical infrastructure. This infrastructure includes both public and private systems vital to national security and other efforts, such as providing the essential services that underpin American society. As the cybersecurity threat to these systems continues to grow, federal agencies have millions of sensitive records that must be protected. Specifically, this critical infrastructure threat could have national security implications and more efforts should be made to ensure that it is not breached. To help address this issue, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed the cybersecurity framework—a voluntary set of cybersecurity standards and procedures for industry to adopt as a means of taking a risk-based approach to managing cybersecurity. However, additional action is needed to strengthen the federal role in protecting the critical infrastructure. Specifically, we have reported on other critical infrastructure protection issues that need to be addressed. For example: DHS did not track vulnerability reduction from the implementation and verification of planned security measures at the high-risk chemical facilities that engage with the department, as a basis for assessing performance. Entities within the 16 critical infrastructure sectors reported encountering four challenges to adopting the cybersecurity framework, such as being limited in their ability to commit necessary resources towards framework adoption and not having the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively implement the framework. DOD and the Federal Aviation Administration identified a variety of operations and physical security risks that could adversely affect DOD missions. Major challenges existed to securing the electricity grid against cyber threats. These challenges included monitoring implementation of cybersecurity standards, ensuring security features are built into smart grid systems, and establishing metrics for cybersecurity. DHS and other agencies needed to enhance cybersecurity in the maritime environment. Specifically, DHS did not include cyber risks in its risk assessments that were already in place nor did it address cyber risks in guidance for port security plans. Sector-specific agencies were not properly addressing progress or metrics to measure their progress in cybersecurity. For more information on this action area, see appendix IX. We made a total of 21 recommendations to federal agencies to address these weaknesses and others. These recommendations include, for example, a total of 9 recommendations to 9 sector-specific agencies to develop methods to determine the level and type of cybersecurity framework adoption across their respective sectors. As of August 2018, all 21 recommendations had not been implemented. Until these recommendations are implemented, the federal government will continue to be challenged in fulfilling its role in protecting the nation’s critical infrastructure. In addition to our prior work related to the federal government’s efforts to protect critical infrastructure, we also have several ongoing reviews focusing on: the physical and cybersecurity risks to pipelines across the country responsible for transmitting oil, natural gas, and other hazardous liquids; the cybersecurity risks to the electric grid; and the privatization of utilities at DOD installations. The federal government has been challenged in protecting privacy and sensitive data. Advances in technology, including powerful search technology and data analytics software, have made it easy to correlate information about individuals across large and numerous databases, which have become very inexpensive to maintain. In addition, ubiquitous Internet connectivity has facilitated sophisticated tracking of individuals and their activities through mobile devices such as smartphones and fitness trackers. Given that access to data is so pervasive, personal privacy hinges on ensuring that databases of PII maintained by government agencies or on their behalf are protected both from inappropriate access (i.e., data breaches) as well as inappropriate use (i.e., for purposes not originally specified when the information was collected). Likewise, the trend in the private sector of collecting extensive and detailed information about individuals needs appropriate limits. The vast number of individuals potentially affected by data breaches at federal agencies and private sector entities in recent years increases concerns that PII is not being properly protected. Federal agencies should take two types of actions to address this challenge area. In addition, we have previously proposed two matters for congressional consideration aimed toward better protecting PII. Improve federal efforts to protect privacy and sensitive data. We have issued several reports noting that agencies had deficiencies in protecting privacy and sensitive data that needed to be addressed. For example: The Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and external entities were at risk of compromising Medicare Beneficiary Data due to a lack of guidance and proper oversight. The Department of Education’s Office of Federal Student Aid had not properly overseen its school partners’ records or information security programs. HHS had not fully addressed key security elements in its guidance for protecting the security and privacy of electronic health information. CMS had not fully protected the privacy of users’ data on state- based marketplaces. Poor planning and ineffective monitoring had resulted in the unsuccessful implementation of government initiatives aimed at eliminating the unnecessary collection, use, and display of SSNs. For more information on this action area, see appendix X. Appropriately limit the collection and use of personal information and ensure that it is obtained with appropriate knowledge or consent. We have issued a series of reports that highlight a number of the key concerns in this area. For example: The emergence of IoT devices can facilitate the collection of information about individuals without their knowledge or consent; Federal laws for smartphone tracking applications have not generally been well enforced; The FBI has not fully ensured privacy and accuracy related to the use of face recognition technology. For more information on this action area, see appendix XI. We have previously suggested that Congress consider amending laws, such as the Privacy Act of 1974 and the E-Government Act of 2002, because they may not consistently protect PII. Specifically, we found that while these laws and guidance set minimum requirements for agencies, they may not consistently protect PII in all circumstances of its collection and use throughout the federal government and may not fully adhere to key privacy principles. However, revisions to the Privacy Act and the E-Government Act have not yet been enacted. Further, we also suggested that Congress consider strengthening the consumer privacy framework and review issues such as the adequacy of consumers’ ability to access, correct, and control their personal information; and privacy controls related to new technologies such as web tracking and mobile devices. However, these suggested changes have not yet been enacted. We also made a total of 29 recommendations to federal agencies to address the weaknesses identified. As of August 2018, 28 recommendations had not been implemented. These outstanding recommendations include 6 priority recommendations to address weaknesses associated with, among other things, publishing privacy impact assessments and improving the accuracy of the FBI’s face recognition services. Until these recommendations are implemented, federal agencies will be challenged in their ability to protect privacy and sensitive data and ensure that its collection and use is appropriately limited. In addition to our prior work, we have several ongoing reviews related to protecting privacy and sensitive data. These include reviews of: IRS’s taxpayer authentication efforts, including what steps the agency is taking to monitor and improve its authentication methods; the extent to which the Department of Education’s Office of Federal Student Aid’s policies and procedures for overseeing non-school partners’ protection of federal student aid data align with federal requirements and guidance; data security issues related to credit reporting agencies, including a review of the causes and impacts of the August 2017 Equifax data breach; the extent to which Equifax assessed, responded to, and recovered from its August 2017 data breach; federal agencies’ efforts to remove PII from shared cyber threat indicators; and how the federal government has overseen Internet privacy, including the roles of the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, and strengths and weaknesses of the current oversight authorities. In conclusion, since 2010, we have made over 3,000 recommendations to agencies aimed at addressing the four cybersecurity challenges. Nevertheless, many agencies continue to be challenged in safeguarding their information systems and information, in part because many of these recommendations have not been implemented. Of the roughly 3,000 recommendations made since 2010, nearly 1,000 had not been implemented as of August 2018. We have also designated 35 as priority recommendations, and as of August 2018, 31 had not been implemented. The federal government and the nation’s critical infrastructure are dependent on IT systems and electronic data, which make them highly vulnerable to a wide and evolving array of cyber-based threats. Securing these systems and data is vital to the nation’s security, prosperity, and well-being. Nevertheless, the security over these systems and data is inconsistent and urgent actions are needed to address ongoing cybersecurity and privacy challenges. Specifically, the federal government needs to implement a more comprehensive cybersecurity strategy and improve its oversight, including maintaining a qualified cybersecurity workforce; address security weaknesses in federal systems and information and enhance cyber incident response efforts; bolster the protection of cyber critical infrastructure; and prioritize efforts to protect individual’s privacy and PII. Until our recommendations are addressed and actions are taken to address the four challenges we identified, the federal government, the national critical infrastructure, and the personal information of U.S. citizens will be increasingly susceptible to the multitude of cyber-related threats that exist.

Federal law and policy call for a risk-based approach to managing cybersecurity within the government, as well as globally. We have previously reported that the federal government has faced challenges in establishing a comprehensive strategy to provide a framework for how the United States will engage both domestically and internationally on cybersecurity related matters. More specifically, in February 2013, we reported that the government had issued a variety of strategy-related documents that addressed priorities for enhancing cybersecurity within the federal government as well as for encouraging improvements in the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure within the private sector; however, no overarching cybersecurity strategy had been developed that articulated priority actions, assigned responsibilities for performing them, and set time frames for their completion. Accordingly, we recommended that the White House Cybersecurity Coordinator in the Executive Office of the President develop an overarching federal cybersecurity strategy that included all key elements of the desirable characteristics of a national strategy including, among other things, milestones and performance measures for major activities to address stated priorities; cost and resources needed to accomplish stated priorities; and specific roles and responsibilities of federal organizations related to the strategy’s stated priorities. In response to our recommendation, in October 2015, the Director of OMB and the Federal Chief Information Officer, issued a Cybersecurity Strategy and Implementation Plan for the Federal Civilian Government. The plan directed a series of actions to improve capabilities for identifying and detecting vulnerabilities and threats, enhance protections of government assets and information, and further develop robust response and recovery capabilities to ensure readiness and resilience when incidents inevitably occur. The plan also identified key milestones for major activities, resources needed to accomplish milestones, and specific roles and responsibilities of federal organizations related to the strategy’s milestones. Since that time, the executive branch has made progress toward outlining a federal strategy for confronting cyber threats. Table 1 identifies these recent efforts and a description of their related contents. These efforts provide a good foundation toward establishing a more comprehensive strategy, but more effort is needed to address all of the desirable characteristics of a national strategy that we recommended. The recently issued executive branch strategy documents did not include key elements of desirable characteristics that can enhance the usefulness of a national strategy as guidance for decision makers in allocating resources, defining policies, and helping to ensure accountability. Specifically: Milestones and performance measures to gauge results were generally not included in strategy documents. For example, although the DHS Cybersecurity Strategy stated that its implementation would be assessed on an annual basis, it did not describe the milestones and performance measures for tracking the effectiveness of the activities intended to meet the stated goals (e.g., protecting critical infrastructure and responding effectively to cyber incidents). Without such performance measures, DHS will lack a means to ensure that the goals and objectives discussed in the document are accomplished and that responsible parties are held accountable. According to officials from DHS’s Office of Cybersecurity and Communications, the department is developing a plan for implementing the DHS Cybersecurity Strategy and expects to issue the plan by the end of calendar year 2018. The officials stated that the plan is expected to identify milestones, roles, and responsibilities across DHS to inform the prioritization of future efforts. The strategy documents generally did not include information regarding the resources needed to carry out the goals and objectives. For example, although the DHS Cybersecurity Strategy identified a variety of actions the agency planned to take to perform their cybersecurity mission, it did not articulate the resources needed to carry out these actions and requirements. Without information on the specific resources needed, federal agencies may not be positioned to allocate such resources and investments and, therefore, may be hindered in their ability meet national priorities. Most of the strategy documents lacked clearly defined roles and responsibilities for key agencies, such as DHS, DOD, and OMB. These agencies contribute substantially to the nation’s cybersecurity programs. For example, although the National Security Strategy discusses multiple priority actions needed to address the nation’s cybersecurity challenges (e.g., building defensible government networks, and deterring and disrupting malicious cyber actors), it does not describe the roles, responsibilities, or the expected coordination of any specific federal agencies, including DHS, DOD, or OMB, or other non-federal entities needed to carry out those actions. Without this information, the federal government may not be able foster effective coordination, particularly where there is overlap in responsibilities, or hold agencies accountable for carrying out planned activities. Ultimately, a more clearly defined, coordinated, and comprehensive approach to planning and executing an overall strategy would likely lead to significant progress in furthering strategic goals and lessening persistent weaknesses. The exploitation of information technology (IT) products and services through the supply chain is an emerging threat. IT supply chain-related threats can be introduced in the manufacturing, assembly, and distribution of hardware, software, and services. Moreover, these threats can appear at each phase of the system development life cycle, when an agency initiates, develops, implements, maintains, and disposes of an information system. As a result, the compromise of an agency’s IT supply chain can degrade the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its critical and sensitive networks, IT-enabled equipment, and data. Federal regulation and guidance issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) set requirements and best practices for mitigating supply chain risks. The Federal Acquisition Regulation established codification and publication of uniform policies and procedures for acquisition by all executive branch agencies. Agencies are required by the Federal Acquisition Regulation to ensure that contracts include quality requirements that are determined necessary to protect the government’s interest. In addition, the NIST guidance on supply chain risk management practices for federal information systems and organizations intends to assist federal agencies with identifying, assessing, and mitigating information and communications technology supply chain risks at all levels of their organizations. We have previously reported on risks to the IT supply chain and risks originating from foreign-manufactured equipment. For example: In July 2018, we testified that if global IT supply chain risks are realized, they could jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of federal information systems. Thus, the potential exists for serious adverse impact on an agency’s operations, assets, and employees. We further stated that in 2012 we determined that four national security-related agencies—the Departments of Defense, Justice, Energy, Homeland Security (DHS)—varied in the extent to which they had addressed supply chain risks. We recommended that three agencies take eight actions, as needed, to develop and document policies, procedures, and monitoring capabilities that address IT supply chain risk. The agencies generally concurred with the recommendations and subsequently implemented seven recommendations and partially implemented the eighth recommendation. In July 2017, we reported that, based on a review of a sample of organizations within the Department of State’s telecommunications supply chain, we were able to identify instances in which device manufacturers, software developers and contractor support were reported to be headquartered in a leading cyber-threat nation. For example, of the 52 telecommunications device manufacturers and software developers in our sample, we were able to identify 12 that had 1 or more suppliers that were reported to be headquartered in a leading cyber-threat nation. We noted that the reliance on complex, global IT supply chains introduces multiple risks to federal agencies, including insertion of counterfeits, tampering, or installation of malicious software or hardware. Figure 5 illustrates possible manufacturing locations of typical network components. Although federal agencies have taken steps to address IT supply chain deficiencies that we previously identified, this area continues to be a potential threat vector for malicious actors to target the federal government. For example, in September 2017, DHS issued a binding operating directive which calls on departments and agencies to identify any use or presence of Kaspersky products on their information systems and to develop detailed plans to remove and discontinue present and future use of the products. DHS expressed concern about the ties between certain Kaspersky officials and Russian intelligence and other government agencies, and requirements under Russian law that allow Russian intelligence agencies to request or compel assistance from Kaspersky and to intercept communications transiting Russian networks. On May 11, 2017, the President issued an executive order on strengthening the cybersecurity of federal networks and critical infrastructure. The order makes it the policy of the United States to support the growth and sustainment of a workforce that is skilled in cybersecurity and related fields as the foundation for achieving our objectives in cyberspace. It directed the Secretaries of Commerce and Homeland Security (DHS), in consultation with other federal agencies, to assess the scope and sufficiency of efforts to educate and train the American cybersecurity workforce of the future, including cybersecurity- related education curricula, training, and apprenticeship programs, from primary through higher education. Nevertheless, the federal government continues to face challenges in addressing the nation’s cybersecurity workforce. Agencies had not effectively conducted baseline assessments of their cybersecurity workforce or fully developed procedures for coding positions. In June 2018, we reported that 21 of the 24 agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officer’s Act had conducted and submitted to Congress a baseline assessment identifying the extent to which their cybersecurity employees held professional certifications, as required by the Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2015. However, we found that the results of these assessments may not have been reliable because agencies did not address all of the reportable information and agencies were limited in their ability to obtain complete and consistent information about their cybersecurity employees and the certifications they held. We determined that this was because agencies had not yet fully identified all members of their cybersecurity workforces or did not have a consistent list of appropriate certifications for cybersecurity positions. Further, 23 of the agencies reviewed had established procedures for identifying and assigning the appropriate employment codes to their civilian cybersecurity positions, as called for by the act. However, 6 of the 23 did not address one or more of 7 activities required by OPM in their procedures, such as reviewing all filled and vacant positions and annotating reviewed position descriptions with the appropriate employment code. Accordingly, we made 30 recommendations to 13 agencies to fully implement two of the act’s requirements on baseline assessments and coding procedures. The extent to which these agencies agreed with the recommendations varied. DHS and the Department of Defense (DOD) had not addressed cybersecurity workforce management requirements set forth in federal laws. In February 2018, we reported that, while DHS had taken actions to identify, categorize, and assign employment codes to its cybersecurity positions, as required by the Homeland Security Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2014, its actions were not timely and complete. For example, DHS did not establish timely and complete procedures to identify, categorize, and code its cybersecurity position vacancies and responsibilities. Further, DHS had not yet completed its efforts to identify all of its cybersecurity positions and accurately assign codes to all filled and vacant cybersecurity positions. Table 2 shows DHS’s progress in implementing the requirements of the Homeland Security Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2014, as of December 2017. Accordingly, we recommended that DHS take six actions, including ensuring that its cybersecurity workforce procedures identify position vacancies and responsibilities; reported workforce data are complete and accurate; and plans for reporting on critical needs are developed. DHS agreed with our six recommendations, but had not implemented them as of August 2018. Regarding DOD, in November 2017, we reported that instead of developing a comprehensive plan for U.S. Cyber Command, the department submitted a report consisting of a collection of documents that did not fully address the required six elements set forth in Section 1648 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. More specifically, DOD’s 1648 report did not address an element related to cyber incident training. In addition to not addressing the training element in the report, DOD had not ensured that staff were trained as required by the Presidential Policy Directive on United States Cyber Incident Coordination or DOD’s Significant Cyber Incident Coordination Procedures. Accordingly, we made two recommendations to DOD to address these issues. DOD agreed with one of the recommendations and partially agreed with the other, citing ongoing activities related to cyber incident coordination training it believed were sufficient. However, we continued to believe the recommendation was warranted. As of August 2018, both recommendations had not yet been implemented. Agencies had not identified and closed cybersecurity skills gaps. In November 2016, we reported that five selected agencies had made mixed progress in assessing their information technology (IT) skill gaps. These agencies had started focusing on identifying cybersecurity staffing gaps, but more work remained in assessing competency gaps and in broadening the focus to include the entire IT community. Accordingly, we made a total of five recommendations to the agencies to address these issues. Four agencies agreed and one, DOD, partially agreed with our recommendations citing progress made in improving its IT workforce planning. However, we continued to believe our recommendation was warranted. As of August 2018, all five of the recommendations had not been implemented. Agencies had been challenged with recruiting and retaining qualified staff. In August 2016, we reported on the current authorities chief information security officers (CISO) at 24 agencies. Among other things, CISOs identified key challenges they faced in fulfilling their responsibilities. Several of these challenges were related to the cybersecurity workforce, such as not having enough personnel to oversee the implementation of the number and scope of security requirements. In addition, CISOs stated that they were not able to offer salaries that were competitive with the private sector for candidates with high-demand technical skills. Furthermore, CISOs stated that certain security personnel lacked the skill sets needed or were not sufficiently trained. To assist CISOs in carrying out their responsibilities and better define their roles, we made a total of 34 recommendations to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and 13 agencies in our review. Agency responses to the recommendations varied; as of August 2018, 18 of the 34 recommendations had not been implemented. Agencies have had difficulty navigating the federal hiring process. In August 2016, we reported on the extent to which federal hiring authorities were meeting agency needs. Although competitive hiring has been the traditional method of hiring, agencies can use additional hiring authorities to expedite the hiring process or achieve certain public policy goals. Among other things, we noted that agencies rely on a relatively small number of hiring authorities (as established by law, executive order, or regulation) to fill the vast majority of hires into the federal civil service. Further, while OPM collects a variety of data to assess the federal hiring process, neither it nor agencies used this information to assess the effectiveness of hiring authorities. Conducting such assessments would be a critical first step in making more strategic use of the available hiring authorities to more effectively meet their hiring needs. Accordingly, we made three recommendations to OPM to work with agencies to strengthen hiring efforts. OPM generally agreed with the recommendations; however, as of August 2018, two of them had not been implemented. The emergence of new technologies can potentially introduce security vulnerabilities for those technologies which were previous unknown. As we have previously reported, additional processes and controls will need to be developed to potentially address these new vulnerabilities. While some progress has been made to address the security and privacy issues associated with these technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and vehicle networks, there is still much work to be done. For example: IoT devices that continuously collect and process information are potentially vulnerable to cyber-attacks. In May 2017, we reported that the IoT has become increasingly used to communicate and process vast amounts of information using “smart” devices (such as fitness trackers, cameras, and thermostats). However, we noted that this emerging technology also presents new issues in areas such as information security, privacy, and safety. For example, IoT devices, networks, or the cloud servers where they store data can be compromised in a cyberattack. Table 3 provides examples of cyber- attacks that could affect IoT devices and networks. IoT devices may increase the security risks to federal agencies. In July 2017, we reported that IoT devices, such as those acquired and used by Department of Defense (DOD) employees or that DOD itself acquires (e.g., smartphones), may increase the security risks to the department. We noted that these risks can be divided into two categories, risks with the devices themselves, such as limited encryption, and risks with how they are used, such as unauthorized communication of information. The department has also identified notional threat scenarios, based on input from multiple DOD entities, which exemplify how these security risks could adversely impact DOD operations, equipment, or personnel. Figure 6 highlights a few examples of these scenarios. In addition, we reported that DOD had started to examine the security risks of IoT devices, but that the department had not conducted required assessments related to the security of its operations. Further, DOD had issued policies and guidance for these devices, but these did not clearly address all of the risks relating to these devices. To address these issues, we made two recommendations to DOD. The department agreed with our recommendations; however, as of August 2018, they had not yet been implemented. Vehicles are potentially susceptible to cyber-attack through networks, such as Bluetooth. In March 2016, we reported that many stakeholders in the automotive industry acknowledge that in-vehicle networks pose a threat to the safety of the driver, as an external attacker could gain control to critical systems in the car. Further, these industry stakeholders agreed that critical systems and other vehicle systems, such as a Bluetooth connection, should be separate in-vehicle networks so they could not communicate or interfere with one another. Figure 7 identifies the key interfaces that could be exploited in a vehicle cyber-attack. To enhance the Department of Transportation’s ability to effectively respond in the event of a real-world vehicle cyberattack, we made one recommendation to the department to better define its roles and responsibilities. The department agreed with the recommendation but, as of August 2018, had not yet taken action to implement it. Artificial intelligence holds substantial promise for improving cybersecurity, but also posed new risks. In March 2018, we reported on the results of a forum we convened to discuss emerging opportunities, challenges, and implications associated with artificial intelligence. At the forum, participants from industry, government, academia, and nonprofit organizations discussed the potential implications of this emerging technology, including assisting with cybersecurity by helping to identify and patch vulnerabilities and defending against attacks; creating safer automated vehicles; improving the criminal justice system’s allocation of resources; and improving how financial services govern investments. However, forum participants also highlighted a number of challenges and risks related to artificial intelligence. For example, if the data used by artificial intelligence are biased or become corrupted by hackers, the results could be biased or cause harm. Moreover, the collection and sharing of data needed to train artificial intelligence systems, a lack of access to computing resources, and adequate human capital were also challenges facing the development of artificial intelligence. Finally, forum participants noted that the widespread adoption raises questions about the adequacy of current laws and regulations. Cryptocurrencies provide an alternative to traditional government-issued currencies, but have security implications. In February 2018, we reported on trends affecting government and society, including the increased use of cryptocurrencies—digital representations of value that are not government-issued—that operate online and verify transactions using a public ledger called blockchain. We highlighted the potential benefits of this technology, such as anonymity and lower transaction costs, as well as drawbacks, including making it harder to detect money laundering and other financial crimes. Because of these capabilities and others, we noted the potential for virtual currencies and blockchain technology to reshape financial services and affect the security of critical financial infrastructures. Lastly, we pointed out that the use of blockchain technology could have more security vulnerabilities as computing power increases as a result of new advancements in quantum computing, an area of quantum information science. In January 2008, the President issued National Security Presidential Directive 54/Homeland Security Presidential Directive 23. The directive established the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative, a set of projects with the objective of safeguarding federal executive branch government information systems by reducing potential vulnerabilities, protecting against intrusion attempts, and anticipating future threats against the federal government’s networks. Under the initiative, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was to lead several projects to better secure civilian federal government networks. Specifically, the agency established the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC), which functions as the 24/7 cyber monitoring, incident response, and management center. Figure 8 depicts the Watch Floor, which functions as a national focal point of cyber and communications incident integration. The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), one of several subcomponents of the NCCIC, is responsible for operating the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS), which provides intrusion detection and prevention capabilities to entities across the federal government. Although DHS is fulfilling its statutorily required mission by establishing the NCCIC and managing the operation of NCPS, we have identified challenges in the agency’s efforts to manage these programs: DHS had not ensured that NCPS has fully satisfied all intended system objectives. In January 2016, we reported that NCPS had a limited ability to detect intrusions across all types of network types. In addition, we reported that the system’s intrusion prevention capability was limited and its information-sharing capability was not fully developed. Furthermore, we reported that DHS’s current metrics did not comprehensively measure the effectiveness of NCPS. Accordingly, we made nine recommendations to DHS to address these issues and others. The department agreed with our recommendations and has taken action to address one of them. However, as of August 2018, eight of these recommendations had not been implemented. DHS had been challenged in measuring how the NCCIC was performing its functions in accordance with mandated implementing principles. In February 2017, we reported instances where, with certain products and services, NCCIC had implemented its functions in adherence with one or more of its principles, as required by the National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014 and Cybersecurity Act of 2015. For example, consistent with the principle that it seek and receive appropriate consideration from industry sector-specific, academic, and national laboratory expertise, NCCIC coordinated with contacts from industry, academia, and the national laboratories to develop and disseminate vulnerability alerts. However, we also identified instances where the cybersecurity functions were not performed in adherence with the principles. For example, NCCIC is to provide timely technical assistance, risk management support, and incident response capabilities to federal and nonfederal entities, but it had not established measures or other procedures for ensuring the timeliness of these assessments. Further, we reported that NCCIC faces impediments to performing its cybersecurity functions more efficiently, such as tracking security incidents and working across multiple network platforms. Accordingly, we made nine recommendations to DHS related to implementing the requirements identified in the National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014 and the Cybersecurity Act of 2015. The department agreed with our recommendations and has taken action to address two of them. However, as of August 2018, the remaining seven recommendations had not been implemented. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA) requires federal agencies in the executive branch to develop, document, and implement an information security program and evaluate it for effectiveness. The act retains many of the requirements for federal agencies’ information security programs previously set by the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002. These agency programs should include periodic risk assessments; information security policies and procedures; plans for protecting the security of networks, facilities, and systems; security awareness training; security control assessments; incident response procedures; a remedial action process, and continuity plans and procedures. In addition, Executive Order 13800 states that the President will hold agency heads accountable for managing cybersecurity risk to their enterprises. In addition, according to the order, it is the policy of the United States to manage cybersecurity risk as an executive branch enterprise because risk management decisions made by agency heads can affect the risk to the executive branch as a whole, and to national security. Over the past several years, we have performed numerous security control audits to determine how well agencies are managing information security risk to federal information systems and data through the implementation of effective security controls. These audits have resulted in the identification of hundreds of deficiencies related to agencies’ implementation of effective security controls. Accordingly, we provided agencies with limited official use only reports identifying technical security control deficiencies for their respective agency. In these reports, we made hundreds of recommendations related to improving agencies’ implementation of those security control deficiencies. In addition to systems and networks maintained by federal agencies, it is also important that agencies ensure the security of federal information systems operated by third party providers, including cloud service providers. Cloud computing is a means for delivering computing services via information technology networks. Since 2009, the government has encouraged agencies to use cloud-based services to store and process data as a cost-savings measure. In this regard, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) established the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) to provide a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. FedRAMP is intended to ensure that cloud computing services have adequate information security, eliminate duplicative efforts, and reduce costs. Although there are requirements and government-wide programs to assist with ensuring the security of federal information systems maintained by federal agencies and third party providers, we have identified weaknesses in agencies’ implementation of information security programs. Federal agencies continued to experience weaknesses in protecting their information and information systems due to ineffective implementation of information security policies and practices. In September 2017, we reported that most of the 24 agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act had weaknesses in each of the five major categories of information system controls (i.e., access controls, configuration management controls, segregation of duties, contingency planning, and agency-wide security management). Weaknesses in these security controls indicate that agencies did not adequately or effectively implement information security policies and practices during fiscal year 2016. Figure 9 identifies the number of agencies with information security weaknesses in each of the five categories. In addition, we found that several agencies had not effectively implemented some aspects of its information security program, which resulted in weaknesses in these agencies’ security controls. In July 2017, we reported that the Security Exchange Commission did not always keep system security plans complete and accurate or fully implement continuous monitoring, as required by agency policy. We made two recommendations to the Security Exchange Commission to effectively manage its information security program. The agency agreed with our recommendations; however, as of August 2018, they had not been implemented. In another July 2017 report, we noted that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) did not effectively support a risk-based decision to accept system deficiencies; fully develop, document, or update information security policies and procedures; update system security plans to reflect changes to the operating environment; perform effective tests and evaluations of policies, procedures, and controls; or address shortcomings in the agency’s remedial process. Accordingly, we made 10 recommendations to IRS to more effectively implement security-related policies and plans. The agency neither agreed nor disagreed with the recommendations; as of August 2018, all 10 recommendations had not been implemented. In May 2017, we reported that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation did not include all necessary information in procedures for granting access to a key financial application; fully address its Inspector General findings that security control assessments of outsourced service providers had not been completed in a timely manner; fully address key previously identified weaknesses related to establishing agency-wide configuration baselines and monitoring changes to critical server files; or complete actions to address the Inspector General’s finding that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had not ensured that major security incidents are identified and reported in a timely manner. We made one recommendation to the agency to more fully implement its information security program. The agency agreed with our recommendation and has taken steps to implement it. In August 2016, we reported that the Food and Drug Administration did not fully implement certain security practices involved with assessing risks to systems; complete or review security policies and procedures in a timely manner; complete and review system security plans annually; always track and fully train users with significant security responsibilities; fully test controls or monitor them; remediate identified security weaknesses in a timely fashion based on risk; or fully implement elements of its incident response program. Accordingly, we issued 15 recommendations to the Food and Drug Administration to fully implement its agency-wide information security program. The agency agreed with our recommendations. As of August 2018, all 15 recommendations had been implemented. In May 2016, we reported that a key reason for the information security weaknesses in selected high-impact systems at four agencies—National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Office of Personnel Management, and Department of Veterans Affairs—was that they had not effectively implemented elements of their information security programs. For example, most of the selected agencies had conducted information security control assessments for systems, but not all assessments were comprehensive. We also reported that remedial action plans developed by the agencies did not include all the required elements, and not all agencies had developed a continuous monitoring strategy. Table 4 identifies the extent to which the selected agencies implemented key aspects of their information security programs. Accordingly, we made 19 recommendations to the four selected agencies to correct these weaknesses. Agency responses to the recommendations varied. Further, as of August 2018, 16 of the 19 recommendations had not been implemented. DOD’s monitoring of progress in implementing cyber strategies varied. In August 2017, we reported that the DOD’s progress in implementing key strategic cybersecurity guidance—the DOD Cloud Computing Strategy, DOD Cyber Strategy, and DOD Cybersecurity Campaign—has varied. More specifically, we determined that the department had implemented the cybersecurity objectives identified in the DOD Cloud Computing Strategy and had made progress in implementing the DOD Cyber Strategy and DOD Cybersecurity Campaign. However, the department’s process for monitoring implementation of the DOD Cyber Strategy had resulted in the closure of tasks as implemented before the tasks were fully implemented. In addition, the DOD Cybersecurity Campaign lacked time frames for completion and a process to monitor progress, which together provide accountability to ensure implementation. We made two recommendations to improve DOD’s process of ensuring its cyber strategies are effectively implemented. The department partially concurred with these recommendations and identified actions it planned to take to address them. We noted that, if implemented, the actions would satisfy the intent of our recommendations. However, as of August 2018, DOD had not yet implemented our recommendations. Agencies had not fully defined the role of their Chief Information Security Officers (CISO), as required by FISMA. In August 2016, we reported that 13 of 24 agencies covered by the CFO Act had not fully defined the role of their CISO. For example, these agencies did not always identify a role for the CISO in ensuring that security controls are periodically tested; procedures are in place for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents; or contingency plans and procedures for agency information systems are in place. Thus, we determined that the CISOs’ ability to effectively oversee these agencies’ information security activities can be limited. To assist CISOs in carrying out their responsibilities and better define their roles, we made a total of 34 recommendations to OMB and 13 agencies in our review. Agency responses to the recommendations varied; as of August 2018, 18 of the 34 recommendations had not been implemented. Presidential Policy Directive-41 sets forth principles governing the federal government’s response to any cyber incident, whether involving government or private sector entities. According to the directive, federal agencies shall undertake three concurrent lines of effort when responding to any cyber incident: threat response; asset response; and intelligence support and related activities. In addition, when a federal agency is an affected entity, it shall undertake a fourth concurrent line of effort to manage the effects of the cyber incident on its operations, customers, and workforce. We have reviewed federal agencies’ preparation and response to cyber incidents and have identified the following weaknesses: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) had not fully implemented controls to address deficiencies identified as a result of a cyber incident. In August 2017, we reported that OPM did not fully implement the 19 recommendations made by the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) after the data breaches in 2015. Specifically, we noted that, after breaches of personnel and background investigation information were reported, US-CERT worked with the agency to resolve issues and develop a comprehensive mitigation strategy. In doing so, US-CERT made 19 recommendations to OPM to help the agency improve its overall security posture and, thus, improve its ability to protect its systems and information from security breaches. In our August 2017 report, we determined that OPM had fully implemented 11 of the 19 recommendations. For the remaining 8 recommendations, actions for 4 were still in progress. For the other 4 recommendations, OPM indicated that it had completed actions to address them, but we noted further improvements were needed. Further, OPM had not validated actions taken to address the recommendations in a timely manner. As a result of our review, we made five other recommendations to OPM to improve its response to cyber incidents. The agency agreed with four of these and partially concurred with the one related to validating its corrective action. The agency did not cite a reason for its partial concurrence and we continued to believe that the recommendation was warranted. As of August 2018, three of the five recommendations had not been implemented. The Department of Defense (DOD) had not identified the National Guard’s cyber capabilities (e.g., computer network defense teams) or addressed challenges in its exercises. In September 2016, we reported that DOD had not identified the National Guard’s cyber capabilities or addressed challenges in its exercises. Specifically, DOD had not identified and did not have full visibility into National Guard cyber capabilities that could support civil authorities during a cyber incident because the department has not maintained a database that identifies National Guard cyber capabilities, as required by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007. In addition, we identified three types of challenges with DOD’s cyber exercises that could limit the extent to which DOD is prepared to support civilian authorities in a cyber incident: limited access because of classified exercise environments; limited inclusion of other federal agencies and critical infrastructure owners; and inadequate incorporation of joint physical-cyber scenarios. In our September 2016 report, we noted that DOD had not addressed these challenges. Furthermore, we stated that DOD had not addressed its goals by conducting a “tier 1” exercise (i.e., an exercise involving national-level organizations and combatant commanders and staff in highly complex environments), as stated in the DOD Cyber Strategy. Accordingly, we recommended that DOD (1) maintain a database that identifies National Guard cyber capabilities and (2) conduct a tier 1 exercise to prepare its forces in the event of a disaster with cyber effects. The department partially agreed with our recommendations, stating that its current mechanisms and exercises are sufficient to address the issues highlighted in our report. However, we continued to believe the recommendations were valid. As of August 2018, our two recommendations had not been implemented. DOD had not identified, clarified, or implemented all components of its incident response program. In April 2016, we also reported that DOD had not clarified its roles and responsibilities for defense support of civil authorities during cyber incidents. Specifically, we found that DOD’s overarching guidance about how it is to support civil authorities as part of its Defense Support of Civil Authorities mission did not clearly define the roles and responsibilities of key DOD entities, such as DOD components, the supported command, or the dual-status commander, if they are requested to support civil authorities in a cyber incident. Further, we found that, in some cases, DOD guidance provides specific details on other types of Defense Support of Civil Authorities-related responses, such as assigning roles and responsibilities for fire or emergency services support and medical support, but does not provide the same level of detail or assign roles and responsibilities for cyber support. Accordingly, we recommended that DOD issue or update guidance that clarifies DOD roles and responsibilities to support civil authorities in a domestic cyber incident. DOD concurred with the recommendation and stated that the department will issue or update guidance. However, as of August 2018, the department had not implemented our recommendation. DHS’s NCPS had limited capabilities for detecting and preventing intrusions, conducting analytics, and sharing information. In January 2016, we reported that NCPS had a limited ability to detect intrusions across all types of network types. In addition, we reported that the system’s intrusion prevention capability was limited and its information-sharing capability was not fully developed. Furthermore, we reported that DHS’s current metrics did not comprehensively measure the effectiveness of NCPS. Accordingly, we made nine recommendations to DHS to address these issues and others. The department agreed with our recommendations and has taken action to address one of them. However, as of August 2018, eight of these recommendations had not been implemented. The nation’s critical infrastructure include both public and private systems vital to national security and other efforts including providing the essential services, such as banking, water, and electricity—that underpin American society. The cyber threat to critical infrastructure continues to grow and represents a national security challenge. To address this cyber risk, the President issued Executive Order 13636 in February 2013 to enhance the security and resilience of the nation’s critical infrastructure and maintain a cyber environment that promotes safety, security, and privacy. In accordance with requirements in the executive order which were enacted into law in 2014, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) facilitated the development of a set of voluntary standards and procedures for enhancing cybersecurity of critical infrastructure. This process, which involved stakeholders from the public and private sectors, resulted in NIST’s Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity. The framework is to provide a flexible and risk-based approach for entities within the nation’s 16 critical infrastructure sectors to protect their vital assets from cyber-based threats. Since then, progress has been made to protect the critical infrastructure of the nation but we have reported that challenges to ensure the safety and security of our infrastructure exist. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had not measured the impact of its efforts to support cyber risk reduction for high- risk chemical sector entities. In August 2018, we reported that DHS had strengthened its processes for identifying high-risk chemical facilities and assigning them to tiers under its Chemical Facility Anti- Terrorism Standards program. However, we found that DHS’s new performance measure methodology did not measure reduction in vulnerability at a facility resulting from the implementation and verification of planned security measures during the compliance inspection process. We concluded that doing so would provide DHS an opportunity to begin assessing how vulnerability is reduced—and by extension, risk lowered—not only for individual high-risk facilities but for the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards program as a whole. We also determined that, although DHS shares some Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards program information, first responders and emergency planners may not have all of the information they need to minimize the risk of injury or death when responding to incidents at high-risk facilities. This was due to first responders at the local level not having access or widely using a secure interface that DHS developed (known as the Infrastructure Protection Gateway) to obtain information about high-risk facilities and the specific chemicals they process. To address the weaknesses we identified, we recommended that DHS take actions to (1) measure reduction in vulnerability of high-risk facilities and use that data to assess program performance, and (2) encourage access to and wider use of the Infrastructure Protection Gateway among first responders and emergency planners. DHS concurred with both recommendations and outlined efforts underway or planned to address them. The federal government had identified major challenges to the adoption of the cybersecurity framework. In February 2018, we reported that there were four different challenges to adopting the cybersecurity framework, including limited resources and competing priorities, reported by entities within their sectors. We further reported that none of the 16 sector-specific agencies were measuring the implementation by these entities, nor did they have qualitative or quantitative measures of framework adoption. While research had been done to determine the use of the framework in the sectors, these efforts had yielded no real results for sector wide adoption. We concluded that, until sector-specific agencies understand the use of the framework by the implementing entities, their ability to understand implementation efforts would be limited. Accordingly, we made a total of nine recommendations to nine sector-specific agencies to address these issues. Five agencies agreed with the recommendations, while four others neither agreed nor disagreed; as of August 2018, all five recommendations had not been implemented. Agencies had not addressed risks to their systems and the information they maintain. In January 2018, we reported that the Department of Defense (DOD) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) identified a variety of operations and physical security risks related to Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Out technology that could adversely affect DOD missions. These risks came from information broadcast by the system itself, as well as from potential vulnerabilities to electronic warfare- and cyber-attacks, and from the potential divestment of secondary-surveillance radars. However, DOD and FAA had not approved any solutions to address the risks they identified to the system. Accordingly, we recommended that DOD and FAA, among other things, take action to approve one or more solutions to address Automatic Dependent Surveillance- Broadcast Out-related security risks. DOD and FAA generally agreed with our recommendations; however, as of August 2018, they had not been implemented. Major challenges existed to securing the electricity grid against cyber threats. In October 2015, we testified on the status of the electricity grid’s cybersecurity, reporting that entities associated with the grid have encountered several challenges. We noted that these challenges included implementation monitoring, built-in security features in smart grid systems, and establishing metrics for cybersecurity. We concluded that continued attention to these issues and cyber threats in general was required to help mitigate these risks to the electricity grid. DHS and other agencies needed to enhance cybersecurity in the maritime environment. In October 2015, we testified on the status of the cybersecurity of our nation’s ports, concluding that steps needed to be taken to enhance their security. Specifically, we noted that DHS needed to include cyber risks in its risk assessments that are already in place as well as addressing cyber risks in guidance for port security plans. We concluded that, until DHS and the other stakeholders take steps to address cybersecurity in the ports, risk of a cyber-attack with serious consequences are increased. Sector-specific agencies were not properly addressing progress or metrics to measure their progress in cybersecurity. In November 2015, we reported that sector-specific agencies were not comprehensively addressing the cyber risk to the infrastructure, as 11 of the 15 sectors had significant cyber risk. Specifically, we noted that these entities had taken actions to mitigate their cyber risk; however, most had not identified incentives to promote cybersecurity in their sectors. We concluded that while the sector-specific agencies have successfully disseminated the information they possess, there was still work to be done to properly measure cybersecurity implementation progress. Accordingly, we made seven recommendations to six agencies to address these issues. Four of these agencies agreed with our recommendation, while two agencies did not comment on the recommendations. As of August 2018, all seven recommendations had not been implemented. Advancements in technology, such as new search technology and data analytics software for searching and collecting information, have made it easier for individuals and organizations to correlate data and track it across large and numerous databases. In addition, lower data storage costs have made it less expensive to store vast amounts of data. Also, ubiquitous Internet and cellular connectivity make it easier to track individuals by allowing easy access to information pinpointing their locations. the effectiveness of these procedures. Based on a survey of the schools, the majority of the schools had policies in place for records retention but the way these policies were implemented was highly varied for paper and electronic records. We also found that the oversight of the school’s programs was lacking, as Federal Student Aid conducts reviews but does not consider information security as a factor for selecting schools. out provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. We made three recommendations to CMS related to defining procedures for overseeing the security of state-based marketplaces and requiring continuous monitoring of state marketplace controls. HHS concurred with our recommendations. As of August 2018, two of the recommendations had not yet been implemented. Poor planning and ineffective monitoring had resulted in the unsuccessful implementation of government initiatives designed to protect federal data. In July 2017, we reported that government initiatives aimed at eliminating the unnecessary collection, use, and display of Social Security numbers (SSN) have had limited success. Specifically, in agencies’ response to our questionnaire on SSN reduction efforts, the 24 agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers Act reported successfully curtailing the collection, use, and display of SSNs. Nevertheless, all of the agencies continued to rely on SSNs for important government programs and systems, as seen in figure 10. Given that access to data is so pervasive, personal privacy hinges on ensuring that databases of personally identifiable information (PII) maintained by government agencies or on their behalf are protected both from inappropriate access (i.e., data breaches) as well as inappropriate use (i.e., for purposes not originally specified when the information was collected). Likewise, the trend in the private sector of collecting extensive and detailed information about individuals needs appropriate limits. The vast number of individuals potentially affected by data breaches at federal agencies and private sector entities in recent years increases concerns that PII is not being properly protected. The emergence of IoT devices can facilitate the collection of information about individuals without their knowledge or consent. In May 2017, we reported that the IoT has become increasingly used to communicate and process vast amounts of information using “smart” devices (such as a fitness tracker connected to a smartphone). However, we noted that this emerging technology also presents new issues in areas such as information security, privacy, and safety. Smartphone tracking apps can present serious safety and privacy risks. In April 2016, we reported on smartphone applications that facilitated the surreptitious tracking of a smartphone’s location and other data. Specifically, we noted that some applications could be used to intercept communications and text messages, essentially facilitating the stalking of others. While it is illegal to use these applications for these purposes, stakeholders differed over whether current federal laws needed to be strengthened to combat stalking. We also noted that stakeholders expressed concerns over what they perceived to be limited enforcement of laws related to tracking apps and stalking. In particular, domestic violence groups stated that additional education of law enforcement officials and consumers about how to protect against, detect, and remove tracking apps is needed. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has not ensured privacy and accuracy related to the use of face recognition technology. In May 2016, we reported that the Department of Justice had not been timely in publishing and updating privacy documentation for the FBI’s use of face recognition technology. Publishing such documents in a timely manner would better assure the public that the FBI is evaluating risks to privacy when implementing systems. Also, the FBI had taken limited steps to determine whether the face recognition system it was using was sufficiently accurate. We recommended that the department ensure required privacy-related documents are published and that the FBI test and review face recognition systems to ensure that they are sufficiently accurate. Of the six recommendations we made, the Department of Justice agreed with one, partially agreed with two, and disagreed with three. We continued to believe all the recommendations made were valid. As of August 2018, the six recommendations had not been implemented. In addition to the contacts named above, Jon Ticehurst, Assistant Director; Kush K. Malhotra, Analyst-In-Charge; Chris Businsky; Alan Daigle; Rebecca Eyler; Chaz Hubbard; David Plocher; Bradley Roach; Sukhjoot Singh; Di’Mond Spencer; and Umesh Thakkar made key contributions to this report.\n\n","[""Federal agencies and the nation's critical infrastructures—such as energy, transportation systems, communications, and financial services—are dependent on information technology systems to carry out operations. The security of these systems and the data they use is vital to public confidence and national security, prosperity, and well-being. The risks to these systems are increasing as security threats evolve and become more sophisticated. GAO first designated information security as a government-wide high-risk area in 1997. This was expanded to include protecting cyber critical infrastructure in 2003 and protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information in 2015. This report provides an update to the information security high-risk area. To do so, GAO identified the actions the federal government and other entities need to take to address cybersecurity challenges. GAO primarily reviewed prior work issued since the start of fiscal year 2016 related to privacy, critical federal functions, and cybersecurity incidents, among other areas. GAO also reviewed recent cybersecurity policy and strategy documents, as well as information security industry reports of recent cyberattacks and security breaches. GAO has identified four major cybersecurity challenges and 10 critical actions that the federal government and other entities need to take to address them. GAO continues to designate information security as a government-wide high-risk area due to increasing cyber-based threats and the persistent nature of security vulnerabilities. GAO has made over 3,000 recommendations to agencies aimed at addressing cybersecurity shortcomings in each of these action areas, including protecting cyber critical infrastructure, managing the cybersecurity workforce, and responding to cybersecurity incidents. Although many recommendations have been addressed, about 1,000 have not yet been implemented. Until these shortcomings are addressed, federal agencies' information and systems will be increasingly susceptible to the multitude of cyber-related threats that exist. GAO has made over 3,000 recommendations to agencies since 2010 aimed at addressing cybersecurity shortcomings. As of August 2018, about 1,000 still needed to be implemented.""]","14863","gov_report","en","None","4cb713e43fe0e8e6185cec6d49636297caf933ab15697ef8","Summary:","gov_report","532","\n\nThe report ""Critical Infrastructure Protection: A Compre"
"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nWith the passage of the NDAA in December 2016, PLCY is to be led by an Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans, who is appointed by the President with advice and consent of the Senate. The Under Secretary is to report directly to the Secretary of Homeland Security. Prior to the NDAA, the office was headed by an assistant secretary. Since the passage of the act, the undersecretary position has been vacant, and as of June 5, 2018, the President had not nominated an individual to fill the position. According to PLCY officials, elevating the head of the office to an undersecretary was important because it equalizes PLCY with other DHS management offices and DHS headquarters components. The NDAA further authorizes, but does not require, the Secretary to establish a position of deputy undersecretary within PLCY. If the position is established, the NDAA provides that the Secretary may appoint a career employee to the position (i.e., not a political appointee). In March 2018, the Secretary named a Deputy Under Secretary, who has been performing the duties of the Deputy Under Secretary and the Under Secretary since then. As shown in figure 1, PLCY is divided into five sub- offices, each with a different focus area. As of June 5, 2018, the top position in these sub-offices was an assistant secretary and two of the five positions were vacant. As of June 5, 2018, 6 of PLCY’s 12 deputy assistant secretary positions were vacant or filled by acting staff temporarily performing the duties in the absence of permanent staff placement. The NDAA codified many of the functions and responsibilities that PLCY had been carrying out prior to the act’s enactment and, with a few exceptions as discussed later in this report, were largely consistent with the duties the office was already pursuing. According to the act and PLCY officials, one of the office’s fundamental responsibilities is to lead, conduct, and coordinate departmentwide policy development and implementation, and strategic planning. According to PLCY officials, there are four categories of policy and strategy efforts that PLCY leads, conducts, or coordinates: Statutory responsibilities: among others, the Homeland Security Act, as amended by the NDAA, includes such responsibilities as establishing standards of validity and reliability for statistical data collected by the department, conducting or overseeing analysis and reporting of such data, and maintaining all immigration statistical information of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services; the Immigration and Nationality Act includes such responsibilities as providing for a system for collection and dissemination to Congress and the public of information useful in evaluating the social, economic, environmental, and demographic impact of immigration laws, and reporting annually on trends in lawful immigration flows, naturalizations, and enforcement actions, Representing DHS in interagency efforts: coordinating or representing departmental policy and strategy positions for larger interagency efforts (e.g., interagency policy committees convened by the White House), Secretary’s priorities: leading or coordinating efforts that correspond to the Secretary of Homeland Security’s priorities (e.g., certain immigration or law-enforcement related issues), and Self-initiated activities: opportunities to better harmonize policy and strategy or create additional efficiencies given PLCY’s ability to see across the department. For example, PLCY officials said that DHS observed an increase in e-commerce and small businesses shipping items via carriers other than the U.S. Postal Service, thus exploiting a gap in DHS monitoring, which covers the U.S. Postal Service and other traditional shipping entities. PLCY officials noted that DHS’s interest in addressing e-commerce issues occurred just before opioids and other controlled substances were being mailed through small businesses and the U.S. Postal Service. As a result, PLCY developed an e-commerce strategy for, among other things, the shipping of illegal items and how to provide information to U.S. Customs and Border Protection before parcels are shipped to the United States from abroad. In accordance with the NDAA, as PLCY leads, conducts, and coordinates policy and strategy, it is to do so in a manner that promotes and ensures quality, consistency, and integration across DHS and applies risk-based analysis and planning to departmentwide strategic planning efforts. The NDAA further provides that all component heads are to coordinate with PLCY when establishing or modifying policies or strategic planning guidance to ensure consistency with DHS’s policy priorities. In addition to the roles PLCY plays that are directly related to leading, conducting, and coordinating policy and strategy, the office is responsible for select operational functions. For example, PLCY is charged with operating the REAL ID and Visa Waiver Programs. The NDAA also conferred responsibilities to PLCY that had not been responsibilities of the DHS Office of Policy prior to the NDAA’s enactment. Among other things, the NDAA charged PLCY with responsibility for establishing standards of reliability and validity for statistical data collected and analyzed by the department, and ensuring the accuracy of metrics and statistical data provided to Congress. In conferring this responsibility, the act also transferred to PLCY the maintenance of all immigration statistical information of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. PLCY has established five performance goals: build departmental policy-making capacity, coordination, and foster the Unity of Effort, mature the office as a mission-oriented, component-focused organization that is responsive to DHS leadership, effectively engage and leverage stakeholders, enhance productivity and effectiveness of policy personnel through appropriate alignment of knowledge, skills, and abilities, and accountability, transparency, and leadership. PLCY officials stated that the office established the performance goals in fiscal year 2015 and they were still in effect as of fiscal year 2018. As previously discussed, DHS has eight operational components. DHS also has six support components. Although each one has a distinct role to play in helping to secure the homeland, there are operational and support functions that cut across mission areas. For example, nearly every operational component has, as part of its security operations, a need for screening, vetting, and credentialing procedures and risk- targeting mechanisms. Likewise, nearly all operational components have some form of international engagement, deploying staff abroad to help secure the homeland before threats reach U.S. borders. Finally, as shown in figure 2, different aspects of broad mission areas fall under the purview of more than one DHS operational component. PLCY is responsible for coordinating three key DHS strategic efforts: the QHSR, the DHS Strategic Plan, and the Resource Planning Guidance. The QHSR is a comprehensive examination of the homeland security strategy of the nation that is to occur every 4 years and include recommendations regarding the long-term strategy and priorities for homeland security of the nation and guidance on the programs, assets, capabilities, budget, policies, and authorities of DHS. The QHSR is to be conducted in consultation with the heads of other federal agencies, key DHS officials (including the Under Secretary, PLCY), and key officials from other relevant governmental and nongovernmental entities. The DHS Strategic Plan describes how DHS can accomplish the missions it identifies in the QHSR report, identifies high-priority mission areas within DHS, and lays the foundation for DHS to accomplish its Unity of Effort Initiative as well as various cross-agency priority goals in the strategic plan, such as cybersecurity. The Resource Planning Guidance describes DHS’s annual resource allocation process in order to execute the missions and goals of the QHSR and DHS Strategic Plan. The Resource Planning Guidance contains guidance over a 5-year period and informs several forward- looking reports to Congress, including the annual fiscal year Congressional Budget Justification as well as the Future Years Homeland Security Program Report. Although PLCY has effectively carried out key coordination functions at the senior level related to strategy, PLCY’s ability to lead and coordinate policy have been limited due to ambiguous roles and responsibilities and a lack of predictable, accountable, and repeatable procedures. According to our analysis and interviews with operational components, PLCY’s efforts to lead and coordinate departmentwide and crosscutting strategies—a key organizational objective—have been effective in providing opportunities for all relevant stakeholders to learn about and contribute to departmentwide or crosscutting strategy development. In this role, PLCY routinely serves as the executive agent for the Deputies Management Action Group and the Senior Leaders Council, which involve analytical and coordination support. PLCY also provides support for deputy- and principal-level decision making. For example, the Strategy and Policy Executive Steering Committee (S&P ESC) meetings have been used to discuss components’ implementation plans for crosscutting strategies, PLCY’s requests for information from components for an upcoming strategy, and updates on departmentwide strategic planning initiatives. According to PLCY and operational component officials, PLCY also provides leadership for the Resource Planning Guidance and Winter Studies, both of which help inform departmentwide resource decision- making. For example, officials from one operational component stated that PLCY’s leadership of the Resource Planning Guidance is a helpful practice for coordination and collaboration on departmentwide or crosscutting strategies. The officials stated that PLCY reaches out to ensure that the component is covering the Secretary’s priorities and this helps the component to ensure that its budget includes them. Furthermore, PLCY develops and coordinates policy options and opinions for the Secretary to present at the National Security Council and other White House-level meetings. For example, PLCY officials told us that, in light of allegations of Russian involvement in using poisonous nerve agents on two civilians in Great Britain, PLCY coordinated the collection of information to develop a policy recommendation for the Secretary to present at a National Security Council meeting. PLCY has encountered challenges leading and coordinating efforts to develop, update, or harmonize policy—also a key organizational objective—because it does not have clearly-defined roles, responsibilities, and mechanisms to implement these responsibilities in a predictable, repeatable, and accountable way. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should establish an organizational structure, assign responsibility, and delegate authority to achieve the entity’s objectives. As such, an organization’s management should develop an organizational structure with an understanding of the overall responsibilities and assign these responsibilities to discrete units to enable the organization to operate in an efficient and effective manner. An organization’s management should also implement control activities through policies. It is important that an organization’s management document and define policies and communicate those policies and procedures to personnel, so they can implement control activities for their assigned responsibilities. In addition, leading collaboration practices we have identified in our prior work include defining and articulating a common outcome, clarifying roles and responsibilities, and establishing mutually-reinforcing or joint strategies to enhance and sustain collaboration, such as the work that PLCY and the components need to do together to ensure that departmentwide and crosscutting policy is effective for all relevant parties. According to PLCY officials, in general, PLCY is responsible for leading the development of a policy when it crosses multiple components or if there is a national implication, including White House interest in the policy. However, PLCY officials acknowledged that this practice does not always make them the lead and there are no established criteria that define the circumstances under which PLCY (or another organizational unit) should lead development of policies that cut across organizational boundaries. PLCY officials said the lead entity for a policy is often announced in an email from the Secretary’s office, on a case-by-case basis. According to PLCY officials, once components have been assigned responsibility for a policy, they have generally tended to retain it, and PLCY may not have oversight for crosscutting policies that are maintained by operational components. Therefore, there is no established, coordinated system of oversight to periodically monitor the need for policy harmonization, revision, or rescission. In the absence of clear roles and responsibilities, and processes and procedures to support them, PLCY and officials in 5 of the 8 components have encountered challenges in coordinating with each other. Although PLCY and most component officials we interviewed described overall positive experiences in coordinating with each other, we identified multiple instances of (1) confusion about which parties should lead and engage in policy efforts, (2) not engaging components at the right times, (3) incompatible expectations around timelines, and (4) uncertainty about PLCY’s role and the extent to which it can and should identify and drive policy in support of a more cohesive DHS. Confusion about who should lead and engage. Officials from one operational component told us that they were tasked with leading a departmentwide policy development effort they believed was outside their area of responsibility and expertise. Officials in another operational component stated that components sometimes end up coordinating among themselves, but that policy development could be more effective and efficient if PLCY took the role of convener and facilitator to ensure the departmentwide perspective is present and all relevant stakeholders participate. Officials from a third component stated that they spent significant time and resources to develop a policy directly related to their component’s mission. As the component got ready to implement the policy, PLCY became aware of it and asked the component to stop working on the policy, so PLCY could develop a departmentwide policy. According to component officials, while they were supportive of a departmentwide policy, PLCY’s timing delayed implementation of the policy the component had developed and wasted the resources it had invested. Moreover, officials from four operational components told us that sometimes counselors from outside PLCY, such as the Secretary’s office, have led policy efforts that seem like they should be PLCY’s responsibility, which created more confusion about what PLCY’s ongoing role should be. PLCY officials agreed that, at times, it has been challenging to define PLCY’s role relative to counselors for the Secretary, and acknowledged that clear guidance to define who is leading which types of policy development and coordination would be helpful. Not engaging components at the right times. Officials from 5 of 8 operational components told us that they had not always been engaged at the right times by PLCY in departmentwide or crosscutting policies that affected their missions. For example, officials from an operational component described a crosscutting policy that had significant implications for some of its key operational resources, but the component was not made aware of the policy until it was about to be presented at the White House. Officials from another component stated that they learned of a new policy after it was in place and had to find significant training and software resources to implement it even though they viewed the policy as unnecessary for their mission. PLCY officials stated that, while they intend to identify all components that should be involved in a policy, there are times when PLCY is unaware a component is developing a policy that affects other components. PLCY officials said they will involve other components when PLCY becomes aware that a component is developing such a policy. PLCY officials stated that it would be helpful to have a process and procedures for cross-component coordination on policies to help guide engagement regardless of who is developing the policy. Incompatible expectations around timelines. Officials at 4 of 8 operational components stated that short timelines from PLCY to provide input and feedback can prevent PLCY from obtaining thoughtful and complete information from components. For example, officials from one component stated that PLCY asked them to perform an analysis that would inform major, departmental decision-making and quickly provide the analysis. Component officials told us that they did not understand why PLCY needed the analysis on such an accelerated timeline, which seemed inappropriate given the level of importance and purpose of the analysis. Officials from another component told us that PLCY had not always provided enough time to provide thoughtful feedback; therefore, component officials were not sure if PLCY really wanted their feedback. Officials from a third component stated that sometimes PLCY did not provide sufficient time for thoughtful input or feedback that had cleared the component’s legal review, so component officials elected to miss PLCY’s deadline and provide late feedback. PLCY officials told us that, frequently, timelines are not within their control, a situation that some component officials also noted during our interviews with them. However, PLCY officials agreed that a documented, predictable, and repeatable process and procedures for policies may help ensure PLCY provides sufficient comment time when in its control and may provide a basis to help negotiate timelines with DHS leadership in other situations. PLCY officials stated that, even with a documented process and procedures, there would still be circumstances when short timelines are unavoidable. Uncertainty about PLCY’s role in driving policy harmonization. Policy officials at 6 of 8 operational components told us that they were unsure or not aware of PLCY’s role in harmonizing policy across the department, and stated a desire for PLCY to be more involved in harmonizing or enhancing departmentwide and crosscutting policy or for greater clarity about PLCY’s responsibility to play this role. As previously discussed, PLCY’s policy and strategy efforts fall into four categories—statutory responsibilities, interagency efforts, Secretary’s priorities, and self- initiated activities; these activities include efforts to better harmonize policies and strategies. According to PLCY officials, the category with the lowest priority is self-initiated activities. PLCY officials stated that PLCY makes tradeoffs and rarely chooses to work on self-initiated projects over its other three categories of effort. According to the officials, PLCY’s work on the other three higher-priority categories is sufficient to ensure that the office is effectively leading, conducting, and coordinating strategy and policy across the department. Given its organizational position and strategic priorities, PLCY is uniquely situated to identify opportunities to better harmonize or enhance departmentwide and crosscutting policy, a role that is in line with its strategic priority to build departmental policymaking capacity and foster Unity of Effort. In the absence of clear articulation of the department’s expectations for PLCY in this role, it is difficult for PLCY and DHS leadership to make completely informed and deliberate decisions about the tradeoffs they make across any available resources. In addition to statutory authority that PLCY received in the NDAA, PLCY officials stated that a separate, clear delegation of authority—a mechanism by which the Secretary delegates responsibilities to other organizational units within DHS—is needed to help confront the ambiguous roles it has experienced in the past. PLCY officials stated that past efforts to finalize a delegation of authority have stalled during leadership changes and that the initiative has been a lower priority, in part, due to where PLCY is in its maturation process and DHS is in its evolution into a more cohesive department under the Unity of Effort. As of May 2018, the effort had been revived, but it is not clear whether and when DHS will finalize it. According to a senior official in the Office of the Under Secretary for Management, a delegation of authority is important for PLCY. He described the creation of a delegation of authority as a process that does more than simply delegate the Secretary’s authority. He noted that defining PLCY’s roles and responsibilities in relation to other organizational units presents an opportunity to engage all relevant components and agree on appropriate roles. He said that, earlier in the organizational life of the Office of the Under Secretary for Management, it went through a process like this, which has been vital in it being able to carry out its mission. He said now that PLCY has a deputy undersecretary in place, this is a good time to restart the process to develop the delegation of authority. Until the delegation or a similar process clearly and fully articulates PLCY’s roles and responsibilities, PLCY and the operational components are likely to continue to experience limitations in collaboration on crosscutting and departmentwide policy. PLCY determines its workforce needs through the annual budget process, but systematic identification of workforce demand, capacity gaps, and strategies to address them could help ensure that PLCY’s workforce aligns with its and DHS’s priorities and goals. To determine its workforce needs each year, PLCY officials told us that, as part of the annual budget cycle, they work with PLCY staff and operational components to determine the scope of activities required for each PLCY area of responsibility and the associated staffing needs. PLCY officials said there are three skill sets needed to carry out the office’s responsibilities: policy analysis, social science analysis, and regional affairs analysis. PLCY officials explained that the office’s priorities can change rapidly as events occur and the Secretary’s and administration’s priorities shift. Therefore, according to PLCY officials, their staffing model must be flexible. They said that, rather than a defined system of full-time equivalents with set position types and levels, PLCY officials start with their budget allotment and consider current and potential emerging needs to set position types and levels, which may fluctuate significantly from year to year. In addition, PLCY officials stated that PLCY staff are primarily generalists and, given the versatility in skill sets of their workforce, PLCY has a lot of flexibility to move staff around if there is an emerging need. For example, if there is an emerging law enforcement issue that affects all law enforcement agencies, PLCY may be tasked with developing a policy to ensure the issue is addressed quickly and that the resulting policy is harmonized across the department and with other law enforcement agencies, such as the Department of Justice. While PLCY completes some workforce planning activities as part of its annual budgeting process, PLCY does not systematically address several aspects of the DHS Workforce Planning Guide that may create more efficient operations and greater alignment with DHS priorities. According to the DHS Workforce Planning Guide, workforce planning is a process that ensures the right number of people with the right skills are in the right jobs at the right time for DHS to achieve the mission. This process provides a framework to: align workforce planning to the department’s mission and goals, predict, then assess how evolving missions, new processes, or environmental conditions may impact the way that work will be performed at DHS in the future, identify gaps in capacity, develop and implement strategies and action plans to address capacity and capability gaps, and continuously monitor the effectiveness of action plans and modify, as necessary. The DHS Workforce Planning Guide stipulates that an organization’s management should not only lead and show support during the workforce planning process, but ensure alignment with the strategic direction of the agency. Moreover, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should use quality information to achieve the entity’s objectives. For example, management uses an entity’s operational processes to make informed decisions and evaluate the entity’s performance in achieving key agency objectives. According to PLCY officials, the current staffing paradigm involves shifting the office’s staff when new and urgent issues arise from the Secretary or White House, and adding these unexpected tasks to staff’s existing responsibilities. However, this means that tradeoffs are made, resulting in some priority items taking longer to address or not getting attention at all. PLCY officials stated that they have been caught off-guard at times by changes in demands placed on PLCY and had to scramble to address the new needs. Additionally, PLCY officials said they have a number of vacancies, which hamper the office’s ability to meet certain aspects of its mission. For example, PLCY’s Office of Cyber, Infrastructure, and Resilience was created in 2015. According to PLCY officials, PLCY has had some resources to address cyber issues, however, there has not been funding to staff this office and an assistant secretary has not been appointed to lead it. Therefore, PLCY officials stated that PLCY has not been able to address its responsibilities for infrastructure resilience. Similarly, PLCY has limited capacity for risk analysis. A provision of the NDAA provides that PLCY is to: develop and coordinate strategic plans and long-term goals of the department with risk-based analysis and planning to improve operational mission effectiveness, including consultation with the Secretary regarding the quadrennial homeland security review under section 707 [6 U.S.C. § 347]. However, PLCY officials acknowledged that their focus on identifying needs for risk analyses and conducting them has been limited, in part, because DHS disbanded the risk management office. Officials from one component told us that they contribute to a report that PLCY coordinates, called Homeland Security National Risk Characteristics, which is prepared as a precursor to the DHS Strategic Plan. PLCY officials stated that, outside of these foundational documents and some risk-based analyses completed as part of specific policy development efforts, PLCY does not have the capacity to complete any additional risk analysis activities. Although PLCY officials said they conduct some analysis of potential demands as a starting point for how to allocate PLCY’s annual staffing budget, these efforts are largely informal and internal and have not resulted in a systematic analysis that provides PLCY and DHS management with the information they need to understand the effects of resource tradeoffs. Also, PLCY officials said they track accomplishments toward PLCY’s strategic priorities as part of a weekly meeting and report, however, officials acknowledged they do not analyze what role workforce decisions have played in achieving or not achieving strategic priorities. Moreover, although PLCY officials stated that they have intermittent, in- person, informal communication about resource use, they have not used the principles outlined in the DHS Workforce Planning Guide to systematically identify and communicate workforce demands, capacity gaps, and strategies to address workforce issues. According to PLCY officials, they have not conducted such analysis, in part, because the Secretary’s office has not requested it of them or the other DHS offices that are funded in the same part of the DHS budget. Regardless of whether the Secretary expects workforce analysis as part of the budgeting process, the DHS Workforce Planning Guide could be used within and outside of the budgeting process to help inform resource decision making throughout the year. PLCY officials stated that at the PLCY Deputy Under Secretary’s initiative, they recently began a review of all relevant statutory authorities, which they will map against the current organizational structure and day- to-day operations. The Deputy Under Secretary plans to use the results of the review to enhance PLCY’s efficiency and effectiveness, and the results could serve as a foundation for a more holistic and systematic analysis of workforce demand, any capacity gaps, and strategies to address them. Employing workforce planning principles—in particular, systematic identification of workforce demand, capacity gaps, and strategies to address them—consistent with the DHS Workforce Planning Guide could better position PLCY to use its workforce as effectively as possible under uncertain conditions. Moreover, using the DHS guide would help PLCY to systematically communicate information about any workforce gaps to DHS leadership, so there is transparency about how workforce tradeoffs affect PLCY’s ability to support DHS goals. As discussed earlier, officials from PLCY and DHS operational components praised existing mechanisms to coordinate and communicate at the senior level, especially about strategy. However, component officials identified opportunities for PLCY to better connect at the staff level to identify and respond to emerging policy and strategy needs. Leading practices for collaboration that we have identified in our prior work state that it is important to ensure that all relevant participants have been included in a collaborative effort, and positive working relationships among participants from different agencies or offices can bridge organizational cultures. These relationships build trust and foster communication, which facilitate collaboration. Also, as previously stated, PLCY has mechanisms like the S&P ESC to communicate and coordinate with operational components and other DHS stakeholders at the senior level (e.g., Senior Executive Service officials). However, PLCY does not have a mechanism to effectively engage in routine communication and collaboration at the staff level (e.g., program and policy specialists working at operational components to oversee or implement policy and strategy functions). Specifically, officials with responsibility for policy and strategy at 6 of 8 operational components told us that they did not have regular contact with or know who to contact at PLCY for questions about policies or strategies, or that the reason they knew who to contact was because of existing working relationships, not because of efforts PLCY had undertaken to facilitate such contacts. In addition, some component officials noted that, when they tried to use the PLCY website to coordinate, they found it to be out of date and lacking sufficient information. PLCY officials acknowledged that the website needs improvement. They stated that the office has developed improved content for the website, but does not have the necessary staff to update the website. According to the officials, the needed staff should be hired soon and improved content should be on the website by the end of summer 2018. Although officials at 5 of the 8 operational components we interviewed stated that the quality of PLCY’s coordination and collaboration has improved in the past 2 years or so, component officials offered several suggestions to enhance PLCY’s coordination and collaboration, especially at the staff level. Among these were: conduct routine information sharing meetings with staff-level officials who have policy and strategy responsibilities at each operational component, clearly articulate points of contact, their contact information, and their portfolios at PLCY as well as at other policy and strategy stakeholders, ensure the PLCY website is up-to-date with contact information for PLCY and components that work in strategy and policy areas, and with relevant information about crosscutting strategy and policy initiatives underway, host a forum—such as an annual conference—to bring together policy and strategy officials from PLCY and DHS components to share ideas and make contacts, and prepare a standard briefing for component officials with strategy and policy responsibilities to help ensure that staff at all levels understand what PLCY does, how it works, and opportunities for engagement on emerging policy and strategy needs or identified harmonization opportunities. For example, officials from one component told us that they would like PLCY officials to have in-person meetings with component staff to discuss what PLCY does, who to contact in PLCY, where to find information about policies and strategies, and other relevant information to ensure a smooth working relationship between the component and PLCY. According to PLCY officials, the office recognizes the value of creating mechanisms to connect staff, who work on policy and strategy at all levels in DHS. PLCY officials said they have historically done a better job in coordinating at the senior level, but are interested in expanding opportunities to connect other staff with policy and strategy responsibilities. PLCY officials stated that they are considering creating a working group structure that mirrors existing organizational mechanisms to coordinate at the senior level, but have not taken steps to do so. Routine collaboration among PLCY, operational components, and other DHS offices at the staff level is important to ensure that PLCY is able to carry out its functions under the NDAA, including the effective coordination of policies and strategies. A positive working relationship among these stakeholders can build trust, foster communication, and facilitate collaboration. Such enhanced communication and collaboration across PLCY and among component officials with policy and strategy responsibility could help the department more quickly and completely identify emerging, crosscutting strategy and policy needs and opportunities to enhance policy harmonization. PLCY’s efforts to lead, conduct, and coordinate departmentwide and crosscutting policies have sometimes been hampered by the lack of clearly-defined roles and responsibilities. In addition, PLCY does not have a consistent process and procedures for its strategy development and policymaking efforts. Without a delegation of authority or similar documentation from DHS leadership clearly articulating PLCY’s missions, roles, and responsibilities—along with defined processes and procedures to carry them out in a predictable and repeatable manner—there is continuing risk that confusion and uncertainty about PLCY’s authority, missions, roles, and responsibilities will limit its effectiveness. PLCY employs some workforce planning, but does not systematically apply key principles of the DHS Workforce Planning Guide to help predict workforce demand, and identify any workforce gaps and design strategies to address them. Without this analysis, PLCY faces limitations in ensuring that its workforce is aligned with its and DHS’s priorities and goals. Moreover, the results of this analysis would better position PLCY to communicate to DHS leadership any potential tradeoffs in workforce allocation that would affect PLCY’s ability to meet priorities and goals. PLCY could enhance its use of mechanisms for collaboration and communication with DHS stakeholders at the staff level. Implementation of additional mechanisms at the staff level for regular communication and coordination, including providing up-to-date information to stakeholders about the office, could help PLCY and operational components to better connect in order to identify and address emerging policy and strategy needs. We are making the following four recommendations to DHS: The Secretary of Homeland Security should finalize a delegation of authority or similar document that clearly defines PLCY’s mission, roles, and responsibilities relative to DHS’s operational and support components. (Recommendation 1) The Secretary of Homeland Security should create corresponding processes and procedures to help implement the mission, roles, and responsibilities defined in the delegation of authority or similar document to help ensure predictability, repeatability, and accountability in departmentwide and crosscutting strategy and policy efforts. (Recommendation 2) The Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans should use the DHS Workforce Planning Guide to help identify and analyze any gaps in PLCY’s workforce, design strategies to address any gaps, and communicate this information to DHS leadership. (Recommendation 3) The Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans should enhance the use of collaboration and communication mechanisms to connect with staff in the components with responsibilities for policy and strategy to better identify and address emerging needs. (Recommendation 4) We provided a draft of this report for review and comment to DHS. DHS provided written comments, which are reproduced in appendix I. DHS also provided technical comments, which we incorporated, as appropriate. DHS concurred with three of our recommendations and described actions planned to address them. DHS did not concur with one recommendation. Specifically, DHS did not concur with our recommendation that PLCY should use the DHS Workforce Planning Guide to help identify and analyze any gaps in PLCY’s workforce, design strategies to address any gaps, and communicate this information to DHS leadership. The letter described a number of actions, including actions that are also described in the report, which PLCY takes to help ensure alignment of its staff with organizational needs. In the letter, PLCY officials pointed to the workforce activities PLCY undertakes as part of the annual budgeting cycle. We acknowledge that the actions described to predict upcoming priorities and resource needs as part of the annual budgeting cycle are in line with the DHS workforce planning principles. However, as we noted, there are opportunities to apply the workforce planning principles outside the annual budgeting cycle to provide greater visibility and awareness of resource tradeoffs to management inside PLCY and in the Secretary’s office. In the letter, PLCY officials made note of the dynamic and changing nature of its operational environment, stating that it often required them to shift resources and priorities on a more frequent or ad hoc basis than many organizations. We acknowledged in the report that PLCY’s operating environment requires it to maintain flexibility in its staffing approach. However, PLCY has a number of important duties, including helping foster Unity of Effort throughout the department and helping to ensure the availability of risk information for departmental decision making, that require longer-term, sustained attention and strategic management. During interviews, PLCY officials acknowledged that striking a balance between these needs has been difficult and at times they have faced significant struggles. The report describes some areas where, during the time we were conducting our work, it was clear that some tasks and functions, such as risk analyses, lacked the resources or focus necessary to ensure they received sustained institutional attention. It is because of PLCY’s dynamic operating environment, coupled with the need for sustained institutional attention to other key responsibilities, that we recommended PLCY undertake workforce planning activities that would help generate better information for PLCY and DHS management to have full visibility and awareness of gaps and resource tradeoffs. Finally, the letter stated that because PLCY is a very small and flat organization, it is able to identify capacity gaps and develop action plans without obtaining all of the data collected through each recommended element, worksheet, form, and template of the model proposed in the DHS Workforce Planning Guide. We acknowledge that it would be counterproductive for PLCY to engage in data collection and analysis that are significantly more elaborate than its planning needs. Nevertheless, we continue to believe that PLCY could use the principles more robustly, outside the annual budgeting process, to help ensure that it identifies and communicates the effect that resource tradeoffs have on its ability to accomplish its multifaceted mission. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees and the Secretary of Homeland Security.

PLCY supports cohesiveness by, among other things, coordinating departmentwide policy and strategy. In the past, however, questions have been raised about PLCY's efficacy. In December 2016, the NDAA codified PLCY's organizational structure, roles, and responsibilities. GAO was asked to evaluate PLCY's effectiveness. This report addresses the extent to which (1) DHS established an organizational structure and processes and procedures that position PLCY to be effective, (2) DHS and PLCY have ensured alignment of workforce with priorities, and (3) PLCY has engaged relevant component staff to help identify and respond to emerging needs. GAO analyzed the NDAA, documents describing specific responsibilities, and departmentwide policies and strategies. GAO also interviewed officials in PLCY and all eight operational components. According to our analysis and interviews with operational components, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans' (PLCY) organizational structure and efforts to lead and coordinate departmentwide and crosscutting strategies—a key organizational objective–have been effective. For example, PLCY's coordination efforts for a strategy and policy executive steering committee have been successful, particularly for strategies. However, PLCY has encountered challenges leading and coordinating efforts to develop, update, or harmonize policies that affect multiple DHS components. In large part, these challenges are because DHS does not have clearly-defined roles and responsibilities with accompanying processes and procedures to help PLCY lead and coordinate policy in a predictable, repeatable, and accountable manner. Until PLCY's roles and responsibilities for policy are more clearly defined and corresponding processes and procedures are in place, situations where the lack of clarity hampers PLCY's effectiveness in driving policy are likely to continue. Development of a delegation of authority, which involves reaching agreement about PLCY's roles and responsibilities and clearly documenting them, had been underway. However, it stalled due to changes in department leadership. As of May 2018, the effort had been revived, but it is not clear whether and when DHS will finalize it. PLCY does some workforce planning as part of its annual budgeting process, but does not systematically apply key principles of the DHS Workforce Planning Guide to help ensure that PLCY's workforce aligns with its and DHS's priorities and goals. According to PLCY officials, the nature of its mission requires a flexible staffing approach. As such, a portion of the staff functions as generalists who can be assigned to meet the needs of different situations, including unexpected changing priorities due to an emerging need. However, shifting short-term priorities requires tradeoffs, which may divert attention and resources from longer-term priorities. As of June 5, 2018, PLCY also had a number of vacancies in key leadership positions, which further limited attention to certain priorities. According to PLCY officials, PLCY recently began a review to identify the office's authorities in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (NDAA) and other statutes, compare these authorities to the current organization and operations, and address any workforce capacity gaps. Employing workforce planning principles—in particular, systematic identification of workforce demand, capacity gaps, and strategies to address them—consistent with the DHS Workforce Planning Guide could better position PLCY to use its workforce as effectively as possible under uncertain conditions and to communicate effectively with DHS leadership about tradeoffs. Officials from PLCY and DHS operational components praised existing mechanisms to coordinate and communicate at the senior level, especially about strategy, but component officials identified opportunities to better connect PLCY and component staff to improve communication flow about emerging policy and strategy needs. Among the ideas offered by component officials to enhance communication and collaboration were holding routine small-group meetings, creating forums for periodic knowledge sharing, and maintaining accurate and up-to-date contact information for all staff-level stakeholders. GAO is making four recommendations. DHS concurred with three recommendations, including that DHS finalize a delegation of authority defining PLCY's roles and responsibilities and develop corresponding processes and procedures. DHS did not concur with a recommendation to apply the DHS Workforce Planning Guide to identify and communicate workforce needs. GAO believes this recommendation is valid as discussed in the report.""]","6229","gov_report","en","None","eaf2acd9c4a757fefc0b0933bd274cccefa900eb9790f6aa","Summary:","gov_report","532","\n\n\nThe report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) examines the challenges faced by the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Policy, Planning, and Strategy (PLCY) in leading, leading, conducting, and coordinating departmentwide and crosscutting policies and strategies.

"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nThe Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act), as amended, establishes the process for states or tribal entities to request a presidential disaster declaration. The act also generally defines the federal government’s role during the response and recovery after a disaster and establishes the programs and process through which the federal government provides disaster assistance to state, local governments, tribal entities and individuals. In addition to its central role in recommending to the President whether to declare a disaster, FEMA has primary responsibility for coordinating the federal response when a disaster is declared as well as recovery, which typically consists of providing grants to assist state and tribal entities to alleviate the damage resulting from such disasters. Once a disaster is declared, FEMA provides assistance through the IA, Public Assistance, and Hazard Mitigation Assistance programs. For instance, some declarations may provide grants only for IA and others only for Public Assistance. Hazard Mitigation Assistance grants, on the other hand, are available for all declarations if the affected area has a FEMA-approved Hazard Mitigation plan. The process for requesting assistance is the same for the three types of assistance. Under the Stafford Act, states’ governors or tribal chief executives may request federal assistance, if state and tribal resources are overwhelmed after a disaster. As part of the request to the President, a governor or tribal chief executive must affirm that the state or tribe has implemented an emergency plan and that the situation is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the state or tribal entity, among other things. After a state or tribe submits a request for disaster declaration through FEMA’s regional office, the regional office is to evaluate the request and make a regional recommendation through the RVAR, which is submitted to FEMA headquarters for further review. The FEMA administrator then is to review the state’s or tribe’s request and the RVAR, and recommend to the President whether a disaster declaration is warranted. Figure 1 shows the process for a disaster declaration from the time a disaster occurs until the President approves or denies a declaration request. The IA program provides financial and direct assistance to disaster victims for expenses and needs that cannot be met through other means, such as insurance. The IA comprises five different programs as shown below. When states or tribal entities request disaster declarations, they may request assistance under any or all of the five programs. Likewise, when the President makes a disaster declaration, the declaration may authorize IA which may also include any or all of the five IA programs. 1. Individuals and Households Program provides assistance to eligible disaster survivors with necessary expenses and serious needs which they are unable to meet through other means, such as insurance. According to FEMA headquarter officials, direct assistance is provided to individuals to meet housing needs. 2. Crisis Counseling Program assists individuals and communities by providing community-based outreach and psycho-educational services. 3. Disaster Legal Services provides assistance through an agreement with the Young Lawyers Division of the American Bar Association for free legal help to survivors who are unable to secure legal services adequate to meet their disaster-related needs. 4. Disaster Case Management Program involves a partnership between a FEMA disaster case manager and a survivor to develop and carry out a Disaster Recovery Plan. 5. Disaster Unemployment Assistance provides unemployment benefits and reemployment services to individuals who have become unemployed as a result of a major disaster and who are not eligible for regular state unemployment insurance. In accordance with its responsibilities under the Stafford Act, FEMA issued a regulation in 1999 that outlines the six factors regional and headquarters officials are to consider when assessing requests for a disaster declaration and when developing a recommendation to the President for a federal disaster declaration. The regulation states that FEMA considers the six factors not only to evaluate the need for IA but also to measure the severity, magnitude, and impact of the disaster. The state or tribe provides information on these factors when submitting its disaster declaration request. The six factors for IA include the following: 1. Concentration of Damages—characterizes the density of the damage in individual communities. The regulation states that highly concentrated damages “generally indicate a greater need for federal assistance than widespread and scattered damages throughout a state.” For example, concentration of damage data includes the numbers of homes destroyed, homes with major or minor damages, and homes affected. 2. Trauma—the regulation provides conditions that might cause trauma including large numbers of injuries and deaths, large-scale disruption of normal community functions, and emergency needs such as extended loss of power or water. 3. Special Populations—FEMA considers the impact of the disaster on special populations, such as low-income populations, the elderly, or the unemployed. 4. Voluntary Agency Assistance—involves the availability and capabilities of voluntary, faith, and community-based organizations, and state and local programs to help meet both the emergency and recovery needs of individuals affected by disasters. 5. Insurance Coverage—addresses the level of insurance coverage among those affected by disasters. Because disaster assistance cannot duplicate insurance coverage, as recognized in the regulation, if a disaster occurred where almost all of the damaged dwellings were fully insured for the damage that was sustained, FEMA could conclude that a disaster declaration by the President was not necessary in accordance with this factor. 6. Average Amount of Individual Assistance by State—according to the regulation, there is no set threshold for recommending IA. However, it states that the averages, depicted in table 1, may prove useful to states and voluntary agencies as they develop plans and programs to meet the needs of disaster victims. The inference is that these averages generally indicate the amount of damages that could be expected for a state based on its size (small, medium, and large). The averages contained within the regulation and depicted in table 1 are based on disasters that occurred between July of 1994 and July of 1999. The President declared 57 percent of all IA declaration requests from calendars years 2008 through 2016, with total IA obligations of approximately $8.6 billion. FEMA received 294 IA declaration requests from calendar years 2008 through 2016. Of these, the President declared 168 requests (57 percent), and 51 percent of these declarations were from Regions IV and VI, as shown in table 2. Additionally, of the 126 IA declaration requests denied by the President, Regions X and IX had the highest percentage of denials, at 71 percent (10 out of 14) and 67 percent (12 out of 18), respectively, and Region I had the lowest percentage of denials at 13 percent (2 out of 15), as shown in table 3. See appendix I for the number of IA declarations requested, declared, and denied by states and tribes from each FEMA region for disaster declarations requested from calendar years 2008 through 2016. According to a FEMA headquarters official, when a disaster declaration is denied, FEMA sends a denial letter to states or tribes based on the review of all the information available. The letter generally states that the damage was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies, and accordingly the supplemental federal assistance is not necessary. Of the emergency management officials we interviewed in 11 states, officials in five states reported that FEMA provided a rationale behind the denial, while officials in three states reported that no rationale was provided. Among the various types of disasters for which IA declaration requests were received, severe storms, flooding, and tornados accounted for the highest number of IA requests, with drought, fishery closure, and contaminated water being the least common, as shown in table 4. FEMA obligated a total of approximately $8.6 billion in IA for disaster declarations made from calendar years 2008 through 2016. These actual obligations were provided to 46 states and they ranged from less than $1 million to more than $1 billion as shown in figure 2. See appendix II for FEMA’s IA actual obligations by state and type of disasters for disaster declarations made from calendars years 2008 through 2016. Additionally, actual obligations for IA declarations made from calendar years 2008 through 2016 varied greatly by FEMA region, as also shown in figure 3. For example, FEMA Region VI had the highest obligations at around $3.3 billion. Region X had the lowest obligations at $24.8 million. As shown in table 5, the amount of obligations for disasters declarations also varied greatly by state. For example, Louisiana had the highest obligations at approximately $2 billion, followed by New York and Texas at about $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. The state with the lowest obligations was the U.S. Virgin Islands at about $2,100. Six of FEMA’s 10 regional offices reported using all six regulatory factors when evaluating states’ or tribes’ IA declaration requests. Officials from the other 4 regions reported using five of the six factors, with the exception being the average amount of individual assistance by state factor. These officials noted that they do not use this factor because FEMA considers the factor to be outdated or they consider all of the factors holistically. Officials from FEMA’s regional offices also generally reported that the extent to which they consider the six IA regulatory factors equally in all cases varies, depending on the circumstances of the related disaster. Specifically, officials from 7 of the 10 regions stated that they use the regulatory factors on a case-by-case basis as certain factors are more relevant than others based on the disaster. For example, if a tornado hits a rural community and completely destroys all properties within the community with no death or injury, then the regulatory factor for trauma may not be as applicable, while the concentration of damages regulatory factor would have greater relevance. On the other hand, if a tornado hits the center of a town resulting in damages with death and injuries, then the trauma regulatory factor would become more important to consider. Additionally, officials in 3 of the 10 regions reported that in addition to the six regulatory factors, they also take into account institutional knowledge and staff experience when evaluating the regulatory factors. For example, officials in one region stated that their staff have more than 10 years of IA declaration experience, and as such, they are familiar with the extent of the information needed and collect the information accordingly. Based on our analysis of RVARs from July 2012 through December 2016 used to recommend approving or denying IA requests, FEMA regional offices did not consistently obtain and document information on all elements of the IA regulatory factors. As described earlier, FEMA regions are to use the RVAR to document information on the IA factors and to recommend to the FEMA administrator whether a disaster should be declared. According to FEMA headquarters officials, FEMA developed the RVAR template in June 2012 to help ensure consistency across regions when making recommendations to headquarters on IA declaration requests. Officials stated that prior to the template, information on the six factors was mainly provided in narrative format. The new template listed the various elements found within each of the six regulatory factors, guiding the regional offices to provide information based on those elements. For example, instead of providing a general narrative on the trauma factor, the new template listed the elements to be provided under trauma, such as the number of injuries and deaths, as well as information on power outages and disruption of other community functions and services. Also, instead of summarizing the concentration of damages factor, the template allowed regional offices to categorize the damage concentration as low, medium, high, or extreme. Furthermore, the template also provided a uniform format to present quantitative information such as the number of homes destroyed; whether home damages are major or minor; the number of homes affected; and level of home ownership. See appendix III for a sample RVAR template. We analyzed 81 RVARs developed by the 10 FEMA regions from July 2012 through December 2016 and found that regions did not consistently obtain and document information on all elements related to each of the six regulatory factors in their RVARs. As shown in table 6, all 81 RVARs had at least some elements documented but not all for each of the IA regulatory factors. For example, for the IA concentration of damages regulatory factor, the six elements to be addressed include the number of homes destroyed, damaged or affected, damage concentration, and damage to critical facilities. While 44 of the 81 RVARs documented all of the six elements, 37 documented some but not all of the elements. Similarly, for the trauma regulatory factor, the four elements to be addressed include injuries, death, power outages, and disruption of community functions. While 30 of the 81 RVARs documented all of the four elements, 51 documented some but not all of the elements. For the insurance coverage factor, while five RVARs documented all of the elements, 73 RVARs documented some but not all of the elements. Elements under this factor include home ownership, insurance, and flood insurance, when applicable. None of the six regulatory factors were fully documented across all RVARs. See appendix IV for detailed information on the extent to which all of the elements of the six regulatory factors were documented in the RVARs from July 2012 through December 2016. FEMA headquarters officials acknowledged that information related to all the elements for each of the IA regulatory factors were missing from the RVARs. They stated that they had not collected all information on all factors because one factor may have more weight than another based on the specific incident that has occurred. However, they also indicated that they do not fully know and have not evaluated all of the reasons why a region may have omitted information on an element of a factor. FEMA headquarters officials agreed that having complete information on all elements of the regulatory factors in the RVARs would assist in their recommendation process. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government suggest that agencies should establish and operate monitoring activities to ensure that internal controls—such as the documentation of all of the elements of the IA regulatory factors FEMA regions considered—are effective, and to take corrective actions as appropriate. Because it is unclear why regions are not completely documenting all elements related to the current six regulatory factors, such an evaluation could help FEMA identify whether any corrective steps are needed. Doing so could help FEMA ensure it is achieving its stated goals in providing consistency in the evaluation process and in the types of factors it considers. Officials we interviewed in 9 of the 10 FEMA regions and state emergency management offices in all 11 states reported the positive relationship they maintain with each other as a strength in the IA declaration process. For example, both FEMA regional officials and state emergency management officials stated that they have a good working relationship and are in regular communication via telephone or in-person meetings with each other. Also, state emergency management officials we spoke to stated that whenever they are in need of assistance, they know they can reach out to FEMA regional officials for assistance. However, FEMA regional and state emergency management officials we spoke to also reported various challenges with the process. These include the subjective nature of the IA regulatory factors given the lack of eligibility thresholds, the lack of transparency in the decision-making process, and difficulty gathering information on IA regulatory factors. Subjective nature of the IA factors and lack of eligibility thresholds. Officials from 9 of 10 FEMA regions stated the subjective nature of the IA program is a challenge; and officials in 6 of the 10 regions also said they found the lack of eligibility thresholds a challenge. An official in one region stated that unlike FEMA’s Public Assistance program, which has minimum thresholds for eligibility, it is unclear when states should apply for IA funds. Under the Public Assistance program, for example, for states or tribes to qualify for assistance, they must demonstrate that they have sustained a minimum of $1 million in damages and the impact of damages must amount to $1.00 per capita in the state. An official in another region explained that although the subjectivity of the IA factors provides flexibility in determining the type of IA program needed, having some quantifiable criteria could help officials explain to states why their requests were denied or approved. Similarly, officials we interviewed in 7 of the 11 states said they found the subjective nature of the factors with no threshold to be a challenge. A state emergency management official in one state said this subjectivity makes it difficult to determine whether or not the state should make an IA request. A state emergency management official in another state reported that the subjectivity can cause the IA declaration process to be inconsistent, and it is not always clear how or why certain declarations were approved and others were not. Further, a state emergency management official in an additional state also pointed to the subjective nature of the factors with no threshold as a reason for not being able to provide a more detailed rationale behind a declaration denial. To illustrate this, table 7 shows how four states requested IA declarations related to the same tornado in 2012 and varied in what they reported across the six IA factors, such as the levels of damages incurred, special populations among their residents, and insurance coverage. Two of these four states—Kentucky and Indiana—received IA declarations and the other two—Ohio and Illinois—were denied. Lack of transparency. Another challenge reported by FEMA regional and state emergency management officials was the lack of transparency in how FEMA evaluates and provides a recommendation to the President on whether a declaration is warranted. For example, officials we interviewed in 4 of 10 regions indicated the lack of transparency as a challenge. A FEMA official in one region stated that the region would like more transparency regarding what FEMA headquarters recommends to the President and whether the President’s decision aligns with FEMA’s recommendation. State emergency management officials we interviewed in 10 of 11 states also reported that lack of transparency with the IA process is a challenge. For example, an emergency management official in one state said it is not clear how or if FEMA considers all of the factors. Also, an emergency management official in another state reported that it was unclear to him why his state’s declaration request was denied while the requests of other states with similar incidents were declared. Difficulty gathering information on IA regulatory factors. Officials in 4 of 10 FEMA regions reported difficulty gathering information, such as income or insurance coverage, as a challenge. An official in one region stated that it is difficult to obtain information related to IA factors from states. For example, the official said that calculating the concentration of damages is difficult absent technical guidance from FEMA headquarters, as the current guidance only accounts for the number of structure damage but not the impact of damage. Further, officials in two FEMA regions stated that states lack a dedicated IA official, making it difficult for state officials, who play multiple roles, to provide the necessary information related to the IA factors in their IA declaration request. Additionally, a state emergency management official in one state also reported that lack of staff resources in her state makes it difficult to verify all the local damage assessments prior to making a declaration request. Pursuant to the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, in November 2015, FEMA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to revise the six current IA regulatory factors to the following proposed factors: state fiscal capacity and resource availability; uninsured home and personal property losses; disaster-impacted population profile; impact to community infrastructure; casualties; and disaster-related unemployment. According to FEMA headquarters officials, the revisions aim to provide more objective criteria, clarify the threshold for eligibility, and speed the declaration. The officials said the proposed rule also seeks to provide additional clarity and guidance for all the established factors. Table 8 shows FEMA’s description of current and proposed IA factors. FEMA received public comments from 14 states in the Federal Register during the comment period for the proposed rule and proposed guidance. The 14 states expressed concern about the proposed factor for state fiscal capacity and resource availability, including the reliability and relevance of data sources such as total taxable resources. These states expressed concern that the data collection necessary to meet the new requirements would fall upon them, adding to the cost burden of completing an IA disaster declaration request. They also explained that the use of total taxable resources and other similar data is not an effective way to assess a state’s current ability to provide resources following a disaster. Also, these states indicated that the data points such as total taxable resources and per capita personal income that would be used to evaluate state fiscal capacity are outdated and inaccurate and would be an inefficient way to evaluate a state’s true fiscal capacity to respond to a disaster. Regarding the other five proposed factors, several states in their comments raised questions about ambiguities in interpreting the factors or the feasibility and cost of gathering related data. For example, in regards to the factor on disaster impacted population, five states expressed concern that the data required for the disaster-impacted population factor would be a cost burden to the state or that the data would be inappropriate for evaluation. Additionally, two states said unemployment related to a disaster incident for the disaster-related unemployment factor would be hard to quantify in the first 30 days following a disaster. They stated that this was especially an issue given that states work to submit an IA disaster declaration request as soon as possible following a disaster. According to the Office of Management and Budget’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs website, the projected date for finalization of the proposed rule is September 2018; however, as of April 2018, FEMA officials stated that they were not certain whether that timeframe would be met. Until the proposed rule is finalized, we will not know the extent to which the various challenges FEMA regions and state officials raised in our interviews and in comments on the proposed rule will be addressed. FEMA has obligated over $8.6 billion nationwide in IA from calendar years 2008 through 2016, highlighting the importance of FEMA’s evaluation of states’ and tribes’ IA declaration requests. FEMA’s regional offices evaluate the request and make a regional recommendation through the Regional Administrator’s Validation and Recommendation, which documents information on all relevant IA regulatory factors. FEMA has developed the Regional Administrator’s Validation and Recommendation to ensure regions consistently obtain and document the information needed by FEMA to make a disaster declaration recommendation to the President based on the IA regulatory factors. However, FEMA’s regional offices do not consistently obtain and document information on all elements of the current IA regulatory factors. Because it is unclear why regions are not always documenting all of the elements related to these factors, evaluating the reasons why could help FEMA identify if any corrective steps are needed. Doing so could also help FEMA ensure it is meeting its stated goals in providing consistency in the evaluation process and in the types of factors it considers. We recommend that the Administrator of FEMA evaluate why regions are not completing the Regional Administrator’s Validation and Recommendations for each element of the current IA regulatory factors and take corrective steps, if necessary. We provided a draft of this report to DHS for its review and comment. DHS provided written comments, which are summarized below and reproduced in full in appendix V. DHS concurred with the recommendation and described planned actions to address it. In addition, DHS provided written technical comments, which we incorporated into the report as appropriate. DHS concurred with our recommendation that FEMA evaluate why regions are not completing the Regional Administrator’s Validation and Recommendations for each element of the IA regulatory factors and take corrective steps, if necessary. DHS stated that a FEMA working group consisting of headquarters stakeholders will draft survey questions for FEMA region officials to identify the common reasons why an element of an IA regulatory factor may not be addressed within a RVAR. According to DHS, the working group will also analyze, assess, and present the findings of the survey responses to FEMA senior leadership, and if needed, FEMA will develop and send a memorandum to the regions with additional guidance regarding the appropriate preparation of RVARs. DHS stated that the estimated completion date is in the fall of 2018. These actions, if implemented effectively, should address the intent of our recommendation. We will send copies of this report to the Secretary of Homeland Security, the FEMA Administrator, and the appropriate congressional committees.

Table 9 provides the total number of Individual Assistance declaration requests made, declared, and denied, by region, state, and tribe for disaster declarations requested from calendar years 2008 through 2016. Table 10 provides Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Individual Assistance (IA) actual obligations for declarations made from calendar years 2008 through 2016 by state and type of disaster. As part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) declaration process, FEMA’s regional offices are to evaluate states’ or tribes’ declaration requests, including the IA declaration request, and make a recommendation called the Regional Administrator’s Validation and Recommendation (RVAR) and submit the RVAR to FEMA headquarters. In June 2012, FEMA headquarters issued a template for FEMA regional offices to use in developing the RVAR as identified in figure 3. Tables 11 through 16 provide information on each element of the 6 Individual Assistance (IA) regulatory factors documented in the Regional Administrator’s Validation and Recommendation (RVAR) from July 2012 through December 2016 by the Federal Emergency Management Agency region. In addition to the contact named above, Aditi Archer (Assistant Director), Su Jin Yon (Analyst-In-Charge), Hiwotte Amare, Eric Hauswirth, Susan Hsu, Jun S. (Joyce) Kang, Christopher Keisling, Heidi Nielson, Hadley Nobles, Anne Rhodes-Kline, and Jerome (Jerry) Sandau made significant contributions to this report.\n\n","[""FEMA's IA program provides help to individuals to meet their immediate needs after a disaster, such as shelter and medical expenses. When a state, U.S. territory, or tribe requests IA assistance through a federal disaster declaration, FEMA evaluates the request against regulatory factors, such as concentration of damages, and provides a recommendation to the President, who makes a final declaration decision. GAO was asked to review FEMA's IA declaration process. This report examines (1) the number of IA declaration requests received, declared, and denied, and IA actual obligations from calendar years 2008 through 2016, (2) the extent to which FEMA accounts for the regulatory factors when evaluating IA requests, and (3) any challenges FEMA regions and select states reported on the declaration process and factors and any FEMA actions to revise them. GAO reviewed FEMA's policies, IA declaration requests and obligation data, and FEMA's RVARs from July 2012 through December 2016, the most recent years for which data were available. GAO also reviewed proposed rulemaking comments and interviewed FEMA officials from all 10 regions and 11 state emergency management offices selected based on declaration requests and other factors. From calendar years 2008 through 2016, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Federal Emergency and Management Agency (FEMA) received 294 Individual Assistance (IA) declaration requests from states, U.S. territories, and tribes to help individuals meet their immediate needs after a disaster. Of these, the President declared 168 and denied 126 requests. Across the various types of IA declaration requests, severe storms (190) were the most common disaster type and drought (1) was among the least common. FEMA obligated about $8.6 billion in IA for disaster declarations during this period. GAO found that FEMA regions did not consistently obtain and document information on all elements of established IA regulatory factors when making IA recommendations to headquarters. Following a declaration request, a FEMA region is to prepare a Regional Administrator's Validation and Recommendation (RVAR)—a document designed to include data on each of the six IA regulatory factors for each declaration request as well as the regional administrator's recommendation. GAO reviewed all 81 RVARs from July 2012—the date FEMA began using the new RVAR template—through December 2016. GAO found that regions did not consistently obtain and document information for the elements required under the six regulatory factors (see table). For example, only 44 of the 81 RVARs documented all elements under the concentration of damage factor. By evaluating why regions are not completing all elements of each current IA regulatory factor, FEMA could identify whether any corrective steps are needed. Officials from the 10 FEMA regions and 11 states GAO interviewed, reported positive relationships with each other, but also cited various challenges with the IA declaration process and regulatory factors. For example, these officials told GAO that there are no established minimum thresholds for IA, making final determinations more subjective and the rationale behind denials unclear. However, as required by the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, FEMA has taken steps to revise the IA factors by issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking. According to FEMA, the proposed rule aims to provide more objective criteria, clarify the threshold for eligibility, and speed up the IA declaration process. As of April 2018, the proposed rule was still under consideration. According to FEMA officials, they plan to finalize the rule in late 2018; therefore, it is too early to know the extent to which it will address these challenges. GAO recommends that FEMA evaluate why regions are not completing the RVARs for each element of the current IA regulatory factors and take corrective steps, if necessary. DHS concurred with the recommendation.""]","4428","gov_report","en","None","caf5073d724df260e53ec2cab2e8cc627e97c0f93798cdba","Summary:","gov_report","532","\nThe report provides an overview of the Robert T.

"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nThe Forest Service’s mission includes sustaining the nation’s forests and grasslands; managing the productivity of those lands for the benefit of citizens; conserving open space; enhancing outdoor recreation opportunities; and conducting research and development in the biological, physical, and social sciences. The agency carries out its responsibilities in three main program areas: (1) managing public lands, known collectively as the National Forest System, through nine regional offices, 154 national forests, 20 national grasslands, and over 600 ranger districts; (2) conducting research through its network of seven research stations, multiple associated research laboratories, and 81 experimental forests and ranges; and (3) working with state and local governments, forest industries, and private landowners and forest users in the management, protection, and development of forest land in nonfederal ownership, largely through its nine regional offices. According to the Forest Service, it employs a workforce of over 30,000 employees across the country. However, this number grows by thousands in the summer months, when the agency hires seasonal employees to conduct fieldwork, respond to wildland fires, and meet the visiting public’s needs. The Office of the Chief of the Forest Service is located in Washington, D.C., with 27 offices reporting directly to the Office of the Chief, as illustrated in figure 1. The nine national forest regions, each led by a regional forester, oversee the national forests and grasslands located in their respective regions. Each national forest or grassland is headed by a supervisor, the seven research stations are each led by a station director, and a state and private forestry area is headed by an area director. The Forest Service collectively refers to its forest regions, research stations, and area as RSAs. The RSAs are organized differently according to their operations, and comparable operations within the RSAs, such as collections from reimbursable agreements, may be processed differently in the various regions and stations, resulting in highly decentralized operations. In addition, the offices of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO); Deputy Chief of Business Operations (includes the budget office); and eight other offices located in the Washington, D.C., headquarters also report directly to the Office of the Chief of the Forest Service. The Forest Service receives appropriations for its various programs and for specific purposes to meet its mission goals. Prior to fiscal year 2017, the Forest Service’s budgetary resources consisted primarily of no-year funds. Its budget office in Washington, D.C., initiates apportionment requests and monitors the receipt of Department of the Treasury (Treasury) warrants. Upon receipt of the warrant, the apportionment is recorded in the financial system and then the budget office develops an allocation summary detailing the allocation of its budget authority by fund, programs within the funds, and distribution of funds at the regional, station, and area levels. The Forest Service may also transfer funds from other appropriations to the appropriations account that funds its fire suppression activities when available funds appropriated for fire suppression and the Federal Land Assistance, Management, and Enhancement (FLAME) fund will be exhausted within 30 days. The Forest Service’s administrative policies, practices, and procedures are issued in its Directive System, which provides a unified system for issuing, storing, and retrieving internal direction that governs Forest Service programs and activities. The Directive System consists of the Forest Service’s manuals and handbooks. The manuals contain management objectives, policies, and responsibilities and provide general direction to Forest Service line officers and staff directors for planning and executing their assigned programs and activities. The handbooks provide detailed direction to employees and are the principal source of specialized guidance and instruction for carrying out directions issued in the manuals. Line officers at the national and RSA levels have authority to issue directives in the manuals and handbooks under their respective jurisdictions. The Forest Service’s policy states that the Directive System is the only place where Forest Service policy and procedures are issued. In addition to the Directive System, Forest Service staff have also developed standard operating procedures (SOP) and desk guides to supplement guidance provided in directives. However, the SOPs and desk guides are not part of the Forest Service Directive System and therefore are not official policy and procedures. While the Forest Service had documented processes for allotting its budgetary resources, it did not have an adequate process and related control activities for reasonably assuring that (1) amounts designated in appropriations acts for specific purposes are used as designated and (2) unobligated no-year appropriation balances from prior years were reviewed for their continuing need. In addition, the Forest Service did not have a properly designed and documented system for administrative control of funds. Finally, the Forest Service had not properly designed control activities for fund transfers for fire suppression activities under its Wildland Fire Management program. While the Forest Service had documented processes for allotting its budgetary resources, it did not have an adequate process and related control activities to reasonably assure that amounts designated in appropriations acts for specific purposes are used as designated—as required by the purpose statute, which states that “appropriations shall be applied only to the objects for which the appropriations were made except as otherwise provided by law.” We reviewed Forest Service documents about its budget authority processes, which included control objectives, related control activities, and processes over the allotment of its budgetary resources. We found that these documents, including manuals and handbooks, did not include an adequate process and related control activities for assuring that appropriated amounts are used for the purposes designated. For example, such a process would include the Forest Service allotting appropriated funds for specific programs or objects as provided in the applicable appropriation act, by either using specific budget line items already defined in the Forest Service’s financial system or creating new budget line items, as needed. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should define objectives clearly to enable the identification of risks and design appropriate control activities to achieve objectives and respond to the risks identified. As a result of the Forest Service not having an adequate process and related control activities for assuring that appropriated amounts are used for the purposes designated, the Forest Service did not properly allocate certain funds for specific purposes detailed in the appropriations acts for fiscal years 2015 and 2016. For example, in fiscal year 2015, the Forest Service did not set aside in its financial system the $65 million specified in the fiscal year 2015 appropriations act for acquiring aircraft for the next- generation airtanker fleet. According to Forest Service documents, as of January 6, 2016, $35 million of the designated funds was used for other purposes. In February 2017, we issued a legal opinion, related to the Forest Service’s use of the $65 million, which concluded that the Forest Service had failed to comply with the purpose statute. According to USDA’s Office of General Counsel, “this lack of any separate apportionment or account for the next-generation airtanker fleet was due to the fact that it was a new item, not included in the agency’s budget request, and added late in the appropriations process.” Similarly, in fiscal year 2016, the Forest Service did not create new budget line items to reserve in its financial system $75 million for the Forest Inventory and Analysis Program specified in the fiscal year 2016 appropriations act. Rather than creating a new budget line item for the program specified in the appropriations act, the funds were combined with an existing budget line item, making it difficult to track related budget amounts and actual expenditures. The lack of an adequate process and related control activities to reasonably assure that appropriated amounts are used for the purpose designated also increases the risk that the Forest Service may violate the Antideficiency Act. The Forest Service did not have a process and related control activities to reasonably assure that unobligated, no-year funds from prior years were reviewed for continuing need. We reviewed the Forest Service’s budget authority process document and related manuals and handbooks, which documented control objectives and procedures over its budgetary resources and the guidance for administrative control of funds. We found that these documents did not include a process for reviewing the Forest Service’s unobligated, no-year funds from prior years and related control activities to reasonably assure that such funds were reviewed for continuing need. Such reviews, if performed, may identify unneeded funds that could be reallocated to other programs needing additional budgetary resources, if consistent with the purposes designated in appropriations acts. The USDA Budget Manual states as a department policy that “agencies of the Department have a responsibility to review their programs continually and recommend, when appropriate, deferrals or rescissions.” The USDA Budget Manual further states the following: “Agency officials should remain alert to this responsibility since the establishment of reserves is an important phase of budgetary administration. If it becomes evident during the fiscal year that any amount of funds available will not be needed to carry out foreseeable program requirements, it is in the interest of good management to recommend appropriate actions, thereby maintaining a realistic relationship between apportionments, allotments, and obligations.” However, the Forest Service did not develop a directive addressing the control objectives, related risks, and control activities for implementing this USDA policy. Up until fiscal year 2017, Forest Service budgetary resources consisted primarily of no-year funds. At the beginning of each fiscal year, unobligated balances of no-year funds are carried forward and reapportioned to become part of budget authority available for obligation in the new fiscal year. Unobligated balances can increase during the fiscal year due to deobligation of prior years’ unliquidated obligations that the Forest Service determines it no longer needs. These resources are immediately available to the Forest Service to the extent authorized by law without further legislation or action from Office of Management and Budget (OMB) unless the apportionment states otherwise. According to Forest Service officials, unobligated funds reported in the Forest Service’s September 30, 2016, Statement of Budgetary Resources included $351 million in discretionary unobligated no-year funds, appropriated as far back as fiscal year 1999. The Forest Service did not identify and define a process and control objectives related to its review of unobligated no-year funds from prior years for continuing need. As a result, the Forest Service did not have reasonable assurance that prior no-year unobligated balances were properly managed and considered in its annual budget requests. This increased the risk that the Forest Service may make budget requests in excess of its needs. Additionally, the Forest Service could miss opportunities to use its prior year unobligated no-year funds more timely and effectively, for example, using these funds for other Forest Service program needs, if consistent with the purposes designated in appropriations acts. During our work, we brought this issue to management’s attention, and in response, Forest Service officials stated that the Forest Service is planning to develop a quarterly process to review available balances and, as needed, redirect funds to agency priorities. However, as of July 2017, the Forest Service had not yet developed this review process. Further, Congress rescinded about $18 million of the Forest Service’s prior year unobligated balances and required it to report unobligated balances quarterly within 30 days after the close of each quarter and appropriated multi-year funds instead of no- year funds to the Forest Service for fiscal year 2017. The Forest Service issued guidance related to administrative control of funds in manuals and handbooks, which USDA did not review and approve prior to their issuance. Based on our review of these documents, we found that the processes and related control activities over the administrative control of funds were dispersed in numerous manuals and handbooks, which may hamper a clear understanding of the overall system. Further, the system lacked key elements that would allow it to serve as an adequate system of administrative control of funds. For example, in its manuals and handbooks the Forest Service did not identify, by title or office, those officials with the authority and responsibility for obligating the service’s appropriated funds, such as funds for contracts, travel, and training. As a result, the responsibility for obligating funds was not clearly described and properly assigned in Forest Service policy as required by the USDA Budget Manual and OMB Circular No. A-11. OMB Circular No. A-11 states that the Antideficiency Act requires that the agency head prescribe, by regulation, a system of administrative control of funds, and OMB provided a checklist in appendix H to the circular that agencies can use for drafting their fund control regulations. This requirement is consistent with those in the USDA Budget Manual, which prescribes budgetary administration through a system of administrative controls for its component agencies, including the Forest Service. The USDA Budget Manual states that to the extent necessary for effective administration, (1) the heads of USDA component agencies may delegate to subordinate officials responsibilities in connection with the administrative distribution of funds within apportionments and allotments and the monitoring, control, and reporting of the occurrence of obligations and expenditures under apportionments and allotments and (2) the chain of such responsibility shall be clearly defined. In addition, USDA requires its component agencies to promulgate and maintain administrative control of funds regulation and to send such regulation to USDA’s Office of Program and Budget Analysis for review and approval prior to issuance. Because the Forest Service has not developed and issued a comprehensive system for administrative control of funds that considers all aspects of the budget execution processes, it cannot reasonably assure that (1) programs will achieve their intended results; (2) the use of resources is consistent with the agency’s mission; (3) programs and resources are protected from waste, fraud, and mismanagement; and (4) laws and regulations are followed. We also found that the Forest Service had not reviewed and updated most of its administrative control of funds guidance in the manuals and handbooks for over 5 years. The USDA Budget Manual requires each component to periodically review its funds control system for overall effectiveness and to assure that it is consistent with its agency programs and organizational structures. Further, Forest Service policy also requires routine review, every 5 years, of policies and procedures in its Directive System. According to Forest Service officials, when directives are up for review and update, a staff from the Office of Regulatory and Management Services (ORMS) sends an e-mail reminder to notify responsible personnel that updates to applicable directives are needed. However, we found that the Forest Service does not have adequate controls in place to monitor the reviews and any updates of the manuals and handbooks in its Directive System to reasonably assure that their efforts resulted in timely updates. As a result, the Forest Service is at risk that guidance for its system for administrative control of funds may lose relevance as processes change over time and control activities may become inadequate. The Forest Service did not have properly designed control activities over its process for fund transfers related to wildland fire suppression activities. The Forest Service receives appropriations for necessary expenses for (1) fire suppression activities on National Forest System lands, (2) emergency fire suppression on or adjacent to such lands or other lands under fire protection agreement, (3) hazardous fuels management on or adjacent to such lands, and (4) state and volunteer fire assistance. Transfer of funds from other Forest Service programs to its fire suppression activities occurs when the Forest Service has exhausted all available funds appropriated for the purpose of fire suppression and the FLAME fund. A key aspect of this process is assessing the FLAME forecast, which the Forest Service uses to predict the costs of fighting wildland fires for a given season, and developing a strategy to identify specific programs and the amounts that may be transferred to pay for fire suppression activities when needed. The process for reviewing the FLAME forecast and strategizing the fund transfers was documented in the Basic Budget Desk Guide created by staff in the Forest Service’s Strategic Planning and Budget Analysis Office. However, the desk guide did not contain evidence of review by responsible officials. As a result, the Forest Service lacked reasonable assurance that the desk guide was complete and appropriate for its use. The Basic Budget Desk Guide included a listing of actions to be performed by the analyst for reviewing the FLAME forecast report and developing a strategy for fund transfer from other programs. However, the desk guide did not specify the factors to be considered when developing the strategy. For example, it did not call for documentation addressing the rationale for the strategy or an assessment of the risk that the fund transfer could have on the programs from which the funds would be transferred. The desk guide also did not describe the review and approval of the strategy by a responsible official(s) prior to the fund transfer request sent to the Chief of the Forest Service. According to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, management should design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks and that such control activities should be designed at the appropriate levels in the organizational structure. Further, management may design a variety of transaction control activities for operational processes, which may include verifications, authorizations and approvals, and supervisory control activities. The lack of properly designed control activities for supervisory review of the desk guide and strategy to identify the amounts for fund transfers does not provide the Forest Service reasonable assurance that the objectives of the fund transfers—including mitigating the risk of a shortfall of funding for other critical Forest Service program activities, such as payroll or other day-to-day operating costs—will be efficiently and effectively achieved. The Forest Service enters into various reimbursable agreements with agencies within USDA, other federal agencies, state and local government agencies, and nongovernment entities to carry out its mission for public benefit. The reimbursable agreements may be for the Forest Service to provide goods and services to a third party or to receive goods and services from a third party, or may be a partnership agreement with a third party for a common goal. According to Forest Service officials, the two distinct types of Forest Service reimbursable agreements are (1) fire incident cooperative agreements and (2) reimbursable and advanced collection agreements (RACA). The Forest Service did not have documented processes and related control activities for its fire incident cooperative agreements to reasonably assure the effectiveness and efficiency of its related fire incident operations. In addition, processes and related control activities applicable to RACAs were not adequately described in applicable manuals and handbooks in the Directive System, to reasonably assure that control activities could be performed consistently and effectively. Further, certain RACA processes in the Directive System had not been timely reviewed by management and did not reflect current processes. Moreover, as previously discussed, SOPs and desk guides developed in field offices related to RACA processes were not in the Forest Service’s Directive System. Finally, the Forest Service lacked control activities segregating incompatible duties performed by line officers and program managers in creating reimbursable agreements and the final disposition of related receivables. The Forest Service did not have documented processes and related control activities for its fire incident cooperative agreements to reasonably assure the effectiveness and efficiency of its related fire incident operations and reliable reporting internally and externally. As part of the service’s mission objective to suppress wildland fires, Forest Service officials stated that they enter into 5-year agreements referred to as master cooperative agreements with federal, state, and other entities. These agreements document the framework for commitment and support efficient and effective coordination and cooperation among the parties in suppressing fires, when they occur. The master cooperative agreements do not require specific funding commitments as amounts are not yet known. These agreements vary from region to region because of the differing laws and regulations pertaining to the participating states and other entities. These variations can also result in different billing and collection processes between regions. When a fire occurs, supplemental agreements, which are based on the framework established in the applicable master cooperative agreements, are signed by relevant parties for each fire incident. These agreements establish the share of fire suppression costs incurred by the Forest Service and amounts related to entities that benefitted from those fire suppression efforts. These supplemental agreements require commitment and obligation of funds. As indicated in figure 2, the Forest Service’s obligations for fire suppression activities ranged from $412 million to $1.4 billion over the 10-year period from fiscal years 2007 through 2016. In response to our request for documentation of processes and related control activities over its fire incident cooperative agreements, Forest Service officials stated that processes and related control activities over reimbursable agreements were applicable to both fire incident cooperative agreements and RACAs. However, based on our review of the Forest Service’s processes and related control activities over its reimbursable agreements, we found that the unique features of fire incident cooperative agreements (as compared to features of RACAs) were not addressed in the processes and related controls for reimbursable agreements. For example, there was no process and related control activities over the negotiation and review of (1) a fire incident master cooperative agreement, which is developed before a fire occurs, and (2) supplemental agreements, which are signed by all relevant parties after the start of a fire incident. These supplemental agreements detail, among other things, the terms for (1) fire department resource use, (2) financial arrangements, and (3) specific cost-sharing agreements. Another unique feature of fire incident cooperative agreements, which was not covered in process documents for its reimbursable agreements, was the preparation of the Cost Settlement Package. The preparation of this package does not start until after the fire has ended and the Forest Service has received and paid all bills. According to Forest Service officials, a fire incident is deemed to have ended when there are no more resources (firefighters and equipment) on the ground putting out the fire. However, this definition was not documented in the Forest Service’s manuals and handbooks in the Directive System. Based on our review of documentation that the Forest Service provided for four fire incidents, we found that for these incidents the Cost Settlement Packages and the billings took several months to years to complete after the fire incident. According to Forest Service officials, delays in preparing the Cost Settlement Package in many cases were due to parties involved in suppressing the fires taking a long time to submit their invoices to the Forest Service for payment. Because the preparation of Cost Settlement Packages was not included in the process documents, the Forest Service did not have a defined time frame for when, in relation to the end of the fire, the Cost Settlement Package must be completed. For example, in one case we reviewed, the bill for a cost settlement was sent 9 months after the fire occurred, and in another case, settlement occurred approximately 2 years after the fire occurred. For both fire incidents, based on the reports we reviewed, the fires were contained within a week or two, but the Forest Service does not have a policy for documenting the date when the fire incident is deemed to have ended. Because of the complexity of the process for negotiating and determining the reimbursable amounts from all the costs that the Forest Service pays for a fire incident, the reimbursable amounts may take time to negotiate, and subsequent billing to and collection from parties may take much longer. Forest Service officials stated that some receivables that were not going to be collected until after its financial system’s aging process for receivables deemed such receivables uncollectible and a bad debt are tracked in a spreadsheet outside its financial system. We found that the Forest Service did not have a documented process and related control activities to reasonably assure that its Budget Office was informed of these older receivables being tracked in a spreadsheet and the related progress of collection activities that local program managers and line officers perform, which could affect the reliability of the reported reimbursable receivable amounts. According to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, management should internally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve the entity’s objectives. Without proper communication, important information, such as amounts that the Forest Service will receive from fire incident cost settlement negotiations, may not be considered in the Forest Service’s strategy for the effective and efficient management of fund transfers for fire suppression activities. Processes and related control activities applicable to RACAs were not adequately described in Forest Service manuals and handbooks in its Directive System. RACAs, which may be for research or other nonemergency purposes, are billed and collected based on previously agreed upon billing and collection terms. In accordance with the Forest Service’s Directive System, policies related to business processes, such as RACAs, are documented in its manuals while procedures for performing specialized activities are documented in its handbooks. We found that the manuals and handbooks in the Directive System did not adequately describe the processes and related control activities over the RACA processes to enable efficient and effective performance of the work by appropriate and responsible personnel. The manuals and handbooks related to RACAs state that a manager review the documentation to ensure that the funding supports the objective of the agreement, the agreement is the correct instrument for funding the project, all relevant terms and conditions have been included in the agreement, the entity’s financial strength and capability are acceptable, and all applicable regulations and OMB circulars have been addressed. However, there was no discussion in the manuals and handbooks about when the manager needs to perform the reviews and how these reviews were to be documented. Further, in response to our inquiry regarding procedures performed to assess the entity’s financial strength and capability are acceptable before a RACA is signed, Forest Service officials stated that there is currently no formal process for determining financial capability for RACAs. For reimbursable agreements, the Forest Service’s process documented in its handbook consisted of completing a creditworthiness checklist. However, the handbook did not describe procedures for (1) completing the checklist and (2) documenting responsible personnel’s review and approval of an entity’s acceptable financial capability. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks. Management’s design of internal control establishes and communicates the who, what, when, where, and why of internal control execution to personnel. Documentation also provides a means to retain organizational knowledge and mitigate the risk of having that knowledge limited to a few personnel. Further, the standards also explain that management clearly document internal control in a manner that allows the documentation to be readily available and properly managed and maintained. In addition, the manuals and handbooks applicable to the RACAs have not been timely reviewed by management, and had not been updated to reflect current processes. For example, the document that serves as direction for Forest Service personnel on how to enter into RACAs referred to an outdated financial system that was replaced in fiscal year 2013. Further, the manuals and handbooks for the RACA processes had no indication that they had been reviewed within the past 5 years. Forest Service policy requires routine review, every 5 years, of policies and procedures in its Directive System. According to Forest Service officials, a staff member from ORMS sends an e-mail to officials responsible for updating these policies and procedures. However, appropriate control activities have not been designed to reasonably assure that updates were made, reviewed, approved, and issued as needed for continued relevance and effectiveness. Without adequate descriptions of processes and related control activities in its manuals and handbooks over RACAs, the Forest Service is at risk that processes and related control activities may not be properly, consistently, and timely performed. Further, because it lacks a process and related controls for monitoring and reviewing the updates of the guidance and various process documents in the Directive System, the Forest Service is at risk that its policies and procedures may not provide appropriate agency-wide direction in achieving control objectives, particularly when financial systems change and old processes may no longer be applicable. SOPs and desk guides related to RACA processes were not in the Directive System and are not considered official Forest Service policy and procedures. Forest Service field staff responsible for various processes generally developed SOPs and desk guides to document day-to-day procedures for employees in carrying out RACA processes to supplement the manuals and handbooks. However, the SOPs and desk guides did not reference the applicable manuals and handbooks they supplemented. Further, the SOPs and desk guides did not provide descriptions of (1) review procedures for authorization, completeness, and validity of RACAs and related receivables; (2) detailed review procedures to be performed and by whom; (3) timing of review procedures; and (4) how to document the completion of the review procedures. Finally, SOPs and desk guides did not have evidence that responsible officials reviewed and approved them to authorize their use. These SOPs and desk guides are only available in the field office where these were developed, and if similar SOPs and desk guides were developed in other field offices, control activities and how they are performed could vary. We also noted that these SOPs and desk guides were not timely updated to reflect processes and systems currently in use. For example, there were many instances where the SOPs and desk guides referred to systems that the Forest Service no longer used. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should establish an organizational structure, assign responsibility, and delegate authority to achieve the entity’s objectives. Effective documentation assists in management’s design of internal control by establishing and communicating the who, what, when, where, and why of internal control execution to personnel. Documentation also provides a means to retain organizational knowledge and mitigate the risk of having that knowledge limited to a few personnel and to achieve the entity’s objectives. Management assigns responsibility and delegates authority to key roles throughout the entity. As a result of the issues discussed above, the Forest Service is at risk that control activities may not be properly and consistently performed and its related control objectives may not be achieved efficiently and effectively. In addition, the Forest Service is at risk that knowledge for performing the control activities may be limited to a few personnel or lost altogether in the event of employee turnover. The Forest Service lacked control activities over the segregation of incompatible duties performed by line officers and program managers for reimbursable agreements and any adjustments affecting the final disposition of related receivables. Field offices manage the majority of Forest Service projects, including authorizing the agreements and monitoring related collection. The Forest Service line officer for fire incident cooperative agreements and program managers for RACA at the RSA, unit, or field levels initiate and develop the terms of the agreements and are also responsible for any subsequent negotiation of the agreements. In the process of negotiating and settling costs, the line officer or program manager has the authority to cancel or change related receivables that they deemed uncollectible. For example, in a fire incident, the line officer at the region or field level is involved in both developing a Cost Share Agreement and after the fire incident has ended, negotiating the Cost Settlement Package with parties involved in the agreement to determine the final settlement amount that the Forest Service will be reimbursed for expenses paid in suppressing the fire incident. Therefore, the line officer is responsible for initiating the Cost Share Agreement, modifying the Cost Settlement Package, and changing or canceling the related receivable, which represent conflicting duties. We also found that the Forest Service did not have any mitigating controls, such as independent approval of any adjustments affecting the final disposition of receivables, to mitigate the risk of these incompatible duties. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks. Segregation of duties contributes to the design, implementation, and operating effectiveness of control activities. To achieve segregation of key functions, management can divide responsibilities among different people to reduce the risk of error, misuse, or fraud. This may include separating the responsibilities for authorizing or approving transactions, processing and recording them, and reviewing the transactions so that no one individual controls all key aspects of a transaction or event. Forest Service officials stated they did not consider segregating the conflicting duties related to reimbursable agreements because these line officers and program managers were most familiar with the terms of the agreement and the activities performed. However, a lack of adequate segregation of conflicting duties or proper monitoring and review of conflicting duties for receivables from reimbursable agreements could result in receivables not being collected, and an increased risk of fraud. The Forest Service’s processes and related control activities over review of unliquidated obligations were not properly designed to reasonably assure optimum utilization of funds and were inconsistent with USDA and Forest Service policy. Further, Forest Service manuals and handbooks related to the review of unliquidated obligations did not clearly describe control activities and were not timely reviewed by management. The Forest Service reported unliquidated obligations of approximately $2.6 billion and $2.5 billion in its financial statements as of September 30, 2015, and 2016, respectively. In fiscal year 2016, the Forest Service deobligated about $319 million of its unliquidated obligations from prior years. The Forest Service’s procedures related to the review of unliquidated obligations were not properly designed and were inconsistent with USDA and Forest Service policy. In accordance with USDA Departmental Regulation (Regulation 2230-001) and related Forest Service policy, the Forest Service identifies and reviews unliquidated obligations that have been inactive for at least 12 months to determine whether delivery or performance of goods or services is still expected to occur. Once a determination has been made that an unliquidated obligation can be deobligated, program or procurement personnel are to notify finance personnel, in writing, within 5 days of the determination to process the deobligation. Within 15 days of receipt of the written notification, the unliquidated obligations are to be adjusted in the financial management system. The Forest Service CFO is then to be notified in writing that the deobligation was processed. Within 1 month of the close of each quarter, the Forest Service CFO is to submit to USDA’s Associate CFO for Financial Operations a certification stating that the Forest Service has performed reviews of its unliquidated obligations and taken appropriate actions, such as promptly deobligating an unliquidated obligation that is no longer needed. However, the Forest Service’s quarterly certifications are inconsistent with USDA and Forest Service policy because the months included in each quarterly review do not line up with the months outlined in policy. For example, as shown in table 1, based on policy the certification due on October 31, covers the months July through September. However in practice, the certification that the Forest Service prepared for October 31 covers May through July. As a result, the review and certification for August and September would be delayed an entire quarter. According to Forest Service officials, it takes considerable time to produce accurate unliquidated obligations reports from USDA’s financial system and then distribute them to field offices. Therefore, there is not sufficient time for the field offices to review and deobligate amounts not needed from the unliquidated obligations balances to meet USDA’s certification timing and requirements. However, the Forest Service has not developed other processes and control activities that could help meet USDA and Forest Service policy and reasonably assure that unliquidated obligations are reviewed timely and appropriate actions are taken. As a result, there is an increased risk that the Forest Service may not achieve its control objectives of optimum utilization of funds and timely adjustments of obligated balances. The Forest Service’s process and related control activities over its review of unliquidated obligations and resulting certifications were not adequately described in manuals and handbooks in its Directive System. Further, the manuals and handbooks were not timely reviewed and updated to reflect processes and systems currently in use. In accordance with the Forest Service’s Directive System, policies are documented in its manuals while procedures for performing specialized activities are documented in its handbooks. However, we found that the Forest Service’s processes and related control activities for reviewing unliquidated obligations were not adequately described and documented in such manuals and handbooks. Although parts of the applicable section of the handbook referred to procedures, there were no detailed descriptions of the processes, and only references to objectives of the procedures for reviewing unliquidated obligations were listed. For example, in identifying unliquidated obligations for review, the narrative description of the procedures in the handbook states that the responsible obligating official must review each selected unliquidated obligation to determine whether (1) delivery or performance of goods or services has occurred or is expected to occur and (2) accounting corrections to the obligation data in the accounting system are necessary. The handbook also refers to an unliquidated obligations report listing the unliquidated obligations that must be reviewed. The narrative does not provide any detailed procedures that obligating officials or responsible personnel need to perform, how to perform those procedures, and how those control activities are to be documented. The guidance in the handbook was supplemented by two desk guides. However, the desk guides are outside the Forest Service’s Directive System and, as previously noted, the Directive System is the only place where the Forest Service’s policy and procedures are issued. In addition, these desk guides did not reference the applicable guidance in the Directive System that they were supplementing. Further, the process and related control activities for adjusting unliquidated obligations within 15 days of receipt of written notification, as stated in USDA’s policy, were not described in either the handbooks or the desk guides. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks to achieve an effective internal control system. Management’s design of internal control establishes and communicates the who, what, when, where, and why of internal control execution to personnel. Documentation also provides a means to retain organizational knowledge and mitigate the risk of having that knowledge limited to a few personnel. Further, the standards also explain that management clearly document internal control in a manner that allows documentation to be readily available and that documentation be properly managed and maintained. In addition, manuals and handbooks for processes related to review and certification of unliquidated obligations had no evidence that they had been reviewed within the past 5 years for ongoing relevance and effectiveness. According to a Forest Service manual, all service-wide directives, except interim directives, shall be reviewed at least once every 5 years. The Forest Service does not have an effective process in place to monitor the reviews and any updates of the manuals and handbooks in its Directive System. As previously discussed, while ORMS sends an e- mail requesting that the applicable officials review and update the guidance in the manuals and handbooks, there is no follow-up process to help ensure that documents were reviewed and updated as needed. Because the Forest Service’s process and related control activities over its review and certification of unliquidated obligations were not adequately described in its manuals and handbooks, the Forest Service is at risk that its control activities may not reasonably assure that control objectives provide (1) optimum utilization of funds and (2) for unliquidated obligations that are no longer needed to be efficiently and effectively deobligated and made available for other program needs. Adequate processes and related control activities over the Forest Service’s budgetary resources are critical in reasonably assuring that these resources are timely and effectively available for its mission operations, including fire suppression. However, we identified deficiencies in the Forest Service’s processes and related controls over allotments, unobligated no-year funds from prior years, administrative control of funds, fund transfers, reimbursable agreements, and available funds from deobligation of unliquidated obligations. Deficiencies ranged from a lack of processes to control activities that were not properly designed, resulting in an increased risk that Forest Service funds may not be effectively and efficiently monitored and used. In addition, the Forest Service’s manuals and handbooks, which provide the directives for the areas we reviewed, had not been reviewed by management in accordance with the Forest Service’s 5-year review policy. Further, Forest Service staff prepared SOPs and desk guides that documented control activities, but they were not issued as official policy and had not been reviewed and approved by responsible officials. As a result, the Forest Service is at increased risk that the control activities may not be consistently performed across the agency and that the guidance in the SOPs and desk guides may not comply with agency policy in the Directive System. To improve internal controls over the Forest Service’s budget execution processes, we are making the following 11 recommendations: The Chief of the Forest Service should (1) revise its process and (2) design, document, and implement related control activities to reasonably assure that amounts designated in appropriations acts for specific purposes are properly used for the purposes specifically designated. (Recommendation 1) The Chief of the Forest Service should (1) develop a process and (2) design, document, and implement related control activities to reasonably assure that unobligated no-year funds from prior years are reviewed for continuing need. (Recommendation 2) The Chief of the Forest Service should (1) design, document, and implement a comprehensive system for administrative control of funds and (2) submit it for review and approval by USDA before issuance, as required by the USDA Budget Manual. (Recommendation 3) The Chief of the Forest Service should design, document, and implement control activities over the preparation and approval of a fire suppression fund transfers strategy, to specify all appropriate factors to be considered in developing and documenting the strategy, and incorporate these control activities into the Directive System. (Recommendation 4) The Chief of the Forest Service should design, document, and implement processes and related control activities for its fire incident cooperative agreements to reasonably assure efficient and effective operations and timely and reliable reporting of reimbursable receivables related to fire incident cooperative agreements, and incorporate them in the Directive System. (Recommendation 5) The Chief of the Forest Service should update the RACA manuals and handbooks to adequately describe the processes and related control activities applicable to RACAs to reasonably assure that staff will know (1) how and when to perform processes and control activities and (2) how to document their performance. (Recommendation 6) The Chief of the Forest Service should design, document, and implement segregation of duties or mitigating control activities over reimbursable agreements and any adjustments affecting the final disposition of related receivables. (Recommendation 7) The Chief of the Forest Service should modify, document, and implement control activities consistent with USDA and Forest Service policy to reasonably assure that unliquidated obligations are reviewed timely and appropriate actions are taken. (Recommendation 8) The Chief of the Forest Service should adequately describe the processes and related control activities for unliquidated obligations review and certification processes in manuals and handbooks within the Directive System. (Recommendation 9) The Chief of the Forest Service should develop, document, and implement a process and related control activities to reasonably assure that manuals and handbooks for allotments, reimbursable agreements, and review of unliquidated obligations are reviewed and updated every 5 years, consistent with Forest Service policy. (Recommendation 10) The Chief of the Forest Service should develop, document, and implement a process and related control activities to reasonably assure that SOPs and desk guides (1) clearly refer to guidance in the Directive System for allotments, reimbursable agreements, and review of unliquidated obligations and (2) are reviewed and approved by responsible officials prior to use. (Recommendation 11) We provided a draft of this report to USDA for comment. In its comments, reproduced in appendix III, the Forest Service stated that it generally agreed with the report and that it has made significant progress to address the report’s findings. Specifically, the Forest Service stated that its financial policies concerning budget execution have been revised to address our concerns with allotments, unliquidated obligations, commitments, and administrative control of funds as prescribed by OMB Circular No. A-11. Further, the Forest Service stated that it has undertaken an in-depth review of its unliquidated obligations and modified the certification process to comply with the USDA requirement. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees and to the Secretary of Agriculture and the Chief of the Forest Service. In addition, this report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff members have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-9869 or khana@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff members who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix IV. Our objectives were to determine the extent to which the Forest Service properly designed control activities over (1) allotments of budgetary resources, its system for administrative control of funds, and any fund transfers between Forest Service appropriations; (2) reimbursables and related collections; and (3) unliquidated obligations. We reviewed the Forest Service’s process documents and control activities, policies and procedures from its manual and handbooks in its Directive System, and other guidance in the form of standard operating procedures (SOP) and desk guides to obtain an understanding of internal controls at the Forest Service related to our three objectives. We reviewed the control activities that the Forest Service identified to determine whether the activities would achieve the control objectives that the service identified and whether the activities were consistent with Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government. We also reviewed recent relevant GAO and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Office of Inspector General reports to obtain background information related to the Forest Service’s budget execution processes. We evaluated the design of the Forest Service’s control activities based on data for fiscal year 2016. To address our first objective, we reviewed Forest Service process documents related to allotments and budget authority to obtain an understanding of control activities over the allotments of budgetary resources, its system for administrative control of funds, and any related fund transfers between Forest Service appropriations. The process documents included a list of control objectives and related control activities that the Forest Service had used to assess its internal controls. We also reviewed the related guidance in appendix H to Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-11, Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget for Administrative Control of Funds, to identify requirements that agencies must meet to ascertain whether their controls over funds management are properly designed. We interviewed key officials from the Forest Service’s Strategic Planning, Budget and Accountability Office to gain an understanding of their processes for allotments of budgetary resources, its system for administrative control of funds, and fund transfers between Forest Service appropriations for wildland fire suppression activities, including how each of their risk assessments were performed and their plans to mitigate the risks. We reviewed and analyzed the processes documented in the manuals and handbooks collectively referred to as directives to determine whether the processes and control activities were designed to achieve the Forest Service’s stated objectives. Specifically, we examined the Forest Service’s control activities to determine whether these sufficiently communicated the procedures to be performed and the documentation to be prepared. We also reviewed USDA Budget Manual to determine whether Forest Service guidance was consistent with USDA’s requirements for all of its component agencies, specifically requirements related to the administrative control of funds. To address our second objective, we reviewed the Forest Service’s policies, procedures, and other documentation and interviewed agency officials to develop an understanding of its processes related to reimbursable agreements and related collection activities. We first identified, through interviews with Forest Service officials, the different kinds of reimbursable agreements that the Forest Service enters into with other USDA components, other federal agencies, state and local government agencies, and nongovernment entities to carry out its mission for the benefit of the public. Two distinct types of reimbursable agreements include (1) fire incident cooperative agreements and (2) reimbursable and advanced collection agreements. We reviewed Forest Service process documents and templates related to these two types of reimbursable agreements provided to obtain an understanding of control activities over reimbursable processes. We reviewed the list of control objectives and related control activities that the Forest Service identified to determine whether the control activities were designed to achieve the applicable control objectives. To address our third objective, we reviewed the Forest Service’s policies, procedures, and other documentation related to and interviewed agency officials about unliquidated obligations to develop an understanding of the Forest Service’s review and certification processes for unliquidated obligations balances. We reviewed the Forest Service’s control activities related to its process for reviewing unliquidated obligations to obtain an understanding of control activities around its process and to determine whether the control activities were designed to achieve the applicable control objectives. Based on the results of our evaluation of the Forest Service’s design of internal control activities over the budget execution processes, we did not evaluate the implementation of the control activities or whether they were operating as designed. While our audit objectives focused on certain control activities related to (1) allotments of budgetary resources, the Forest Service’s system for administrative control of funds, and related fund transfers; (2) reimbursables and related collections for reimbursable agreements; and (3) unliquidated obligations, we did not evaluate all control activities and other components of internal control. If we had done so, additional deficiencies may or may not have been identified that could impair the effectiveness of the control activities evaluated as part of this audit. We conducted this performance audit from August 2016 to January 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government provides the overall framework for establishing and maintaining internal control. Internal control represents an agency’s plans, methods, policies, and procedures used to fulfill its mission, strategic plan, goals, and objectives. Internal control is a process by an entity’s oversight body, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of the entity will be achieved. When properly designed, implemented, and operating effectively, it provides reasonable assurance that the following objectives are achieved: (1) effectiveness and efficiency of operations, (2) reliability of internal and external reporting, and (3) compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Internal control is not one event, but a series of actions that occur throughout an entity’s operations. The five components of internal control are as follows: Control Environment - The foundation for an internal control system that provides the discipline and structure to help an entity achieve its objectives. Risk Assessment - Assesses the risks facing the entity as it seeks to achieve its objectives and provides the basis for developing appropriate risk responses. Control Activities - The actions management establishes through policies and procedures to achieve objectives and respond to risks in the internal control system, which includes the entity’s information system. Information and Communication - The quality information management and personnel communicate and use to support the internal control system. Monitoring - Activities management establishes and operates to assess the quality of performance over time and promptly resolve the findings of audits and other reviews. An effective internal control system has each of the five components of internal control effectively designed, implemented, and operating with the components operating together in an integrated manner. In this audit, we assessed the design of control activities at the Forest Service related to its (1) allotments of budgetary resources and any related fund transfers between Forest Service appropriations, (2) reimbursables and related collections, and (3) review of unliquidated obligations. In addition to the contact named above, the following individuals made key contributions to this report: Roger Stoltz (Assistant Director), Meafelia P. Gusukuma (Auditor-in-Charge), Tulsi Bhojwani, Cory Mazer, Sabrina Rivera, and Randy Voorhees.\n\n","[""The Forest Service, an agency within USDA, performs a variety of tasks as steward of 193 million acres of public forests and grasslands. Its budget execution process for carrying out its mission includes (1) allotments, which are authorizations by an agency to incur obligations within a specified amount, and (2) unliquidated obligations, which represent budgetary resources that have been committed but not yet paid. Deobligation refers to an agency's cancellation or downward adjustments of previously incurred obligations, which may result in funds that may be available for reobligation. GAO was asked to review the Forest Service's internal controls over its budget execution processes. This report examines the extent to which the Forest Service properly designed control activities over (1) allotments of budgetary resources, its system for administrative control of funds, and any fund transfers between Forest Service appropriations; (2) reimbursables and related collections; and (3) review and certification of unliquidated obligations. GAO reviewed the Forest Service's policies, procedures, and other documentation and interviewed agency officials. In fiscal years 2015 and 2016, the Forest Service received discretionary no-year appropriations of $5.1 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively. It is critical for the Forest Service to manage its budgetary resources efficiently and effectively. While the Forest Service had processes over certain of its budget execution activities, GAO found the following internal control deficiencies: Budgetary resources . The purpose statute requires that amounts designated in appropriations acts for specific purposes are used as designated. The Forest Service did not have an adequate process and related control activities to reasonably assure that amounts were used as designated. In fiscal year 2017, GAO issued a legal opinion that the Forest Service had failed to comply with the purpose statute with regard to a $65 million line-item appropriation specifically provided for the purpose of acquiring aircraft for the next-generation airtanker fleet. Further, the Forest Service lacked a process and related control activities to reasonably assure that unobligated no-year appropriation balances from prior years were reviewed for their continuing need; did not have a properly designed system for administrative control of funds, which keeps obligations and expenditures from exceeding limits authorized by law; and had not properly designed control activities for fund transfers to its Wildland Fire Management program. These deficiencies increase the risk that the Forest Service may make budget requests in excess of its needs. Reimbursable agreements . To carry out its mission, the Forest Service enters into reimbursable agreements with agencies within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), other federal agencies, state and local government agencies, and nongovernment entities. The Forest Service (1) did not have adequately described processes and related control activities in manuals and handbooks for its reimbursable agreement processes and (2) lacked control activities related to segregating incompatible duties performed by line officers and program managers. For example, line officers may be responsible for initiating cost sharing agreements, modifying cost settlement packages, and changing or canceling the related receivable, which represent incompatible duties. As a result, programs and resources may not be protected from waste, fraud, and mismanagement. Unliquidated obligations . The Forest Service's processes and control activities over the review and certification of unliquidated obligations were not properly designed to reasonably assure the best use of funds and that unliquidated obligations would be efficiently and effectively deobligated and made available for other program needs. Further, the current process, as designed, was inconsistent with USDA and Forest Service policy. In addition, the Forest Service's manuals and handbooks, which provide directives for the areas that GAO reviewed, had not been reviewed by management in accordance with the Forest Service's 5-year review policy. Further, standard operating procedures and desk guides prepared by staff to supplement the manuals and handbooks were not issued as directives and therefore were not considered official policy. This increases the risk that control activities may not be consistently performed across the agency. GAO is making 11 recommendations to improve processes and related internal control activities over the management of the Forest Service's budgetary resources, reimbursable receivables and collections, and its process for reviewing unliquidated obligations. The Forest Service generally agreed with the report and stated that it has made significant progress to address the report findings.""]","8760","gov_report","en","None","7decb8feac7c313ba51e5813869dc0723e029c13c3a6aed1","Summary:","gov_report","532","\n\nThe Forest Service’s mission is to sustain the nation’s forests and grasslands, manage public lands, conduct research, and provide recreational opportunities.

"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nArticle II, Section 2, of the Constitution provides that the President shall appoint officers of the United States ""by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate."" The method by which the Senate provides advice and consent on presidential nominations, referred to broadly as the confirmation process, serves several purposes. First, largely through committee investigations and hearings, the confirmation process allows the Senate to examine the qualifications of nominees and any potential conflicts of interest. Second, Senators can influence policy through the confirmation process, either by rejecting nominees or by extracting promises from nominees before granting consent. Also, the Senate sometimes has delayed the confirmation process in order to increase its influence with the executive branch on unrelated matters. Senate confirmation is required for several categories of government officials. Military appointments and promotions make up the majority of nominations, approximately 65,000 per two-year Congress, and most are confirmed routinely. Each Congress, the Senate also considers approximately 2,000 civilian nominations, and, again, many of them, such as appointments to or promotions in the Foreign Service, are routine. Civilian nominations considered by the Senate also include federal judges and specified officers in executive departments, independent agencies, and regulatory boards and commissions. Many presidential appointees are confirmed routinely by the Senate. With tens of thousands of nominations each Congress, the Senate cannot possibly consider them all in detail. A regularized process facilitates quick action on thousands of government positions. The Senate may approve en bloc hundreds of nominations at a time, especially military appointments and promotions. The process also allows for close scrutiny of candidates when necessary. Each year, a few hundred nominees to high-level positions are regularly subject to Senate investigations and public hearings. Most of these are routinely approved, while a small number of nominations are disputed and receive more attention from the media and Congress. Judicial nominations, particularly Supreme Court appointees, are generally subject to greater scrutiny than nominations to executive posts, partly because judges may serve for life. Among the executive branch positions, nominees for policymaking positions are more likely to be examined closely, and are slightly less likely to be confirmed, than nominees for non-policy positions. There are several reasons that the Senate confirms a high percentage of nominations. Most nominations and promotions are not to policymaking positions and are of less interest to the Senate. In addition, some sentiment exists in the Senate that the selection of persons to fill executive branch positions is largely a presidential prerogative. Historically, the President has been granted wide latitude in the selection of his Cabinet and other high-ranking executive branch officials. Another important reason for the high percentage of confirmations is that Senators are often involved in the nomination stage. The President would prefer a smooth and fast confirmation process, so he may decide to consult with Senators prior to choosing a nominee. Senators most likely to be consulted, typically by White House congressional relations staff, are Senators from a nominee's home state, leaders of the committee of jurisdiction, and leaders of the President's party in the Senate. Senators of the President's party are sometimes invited to express opinions or even propose candidates for federal appointments in their own states. There is a long-standing custom of ""senatorial courtesy,"" whereby the Senate will sometimes decline to proceed on a nomination if a home-state Senator expresses opposition. Positions subject to senatorial courtesy include U.S. attorneys, U.S. marshals, and U.S. district judges. Over the past decade, Senators have expressed concerns over various aspects of the confirmation process, including the rate of confirmation for high-ranking executive branch positions and judgeships, as well as the speed of Senate action on routine nominations. When the Senate is controlled by the party of the President, this concern has often been raised as a complaint that minority party Senators are disputing a higher number of nominations, and have increasingly used their leverage under Senate proceedings to delay or even block their consideration. These concerns have led the Senate to make several changes to the confirmation process since 2011. The changes are taken into account in the following description of the process and are described in detail in other CRS Reports. The President customarily sends nomination messages to the Senate in writing. Once received, nominations are numbered by the executive clerk and read on the floor. The clerk actually assigns numbers to the presidential messages, not to individual nominations, so a message listing several nominations would receive a single number. Except by unanimous consent, the Senate cannot vote on nominations the day they are received, and most are referred immediately to committees. Senate Rule XXXI provides that nominations shall be referred to appropriate committees ""unless otherwise ordered."" A standing order of the Senate provides that some nominations to specified positions will not be referred unless a Senator requests referral. Instead of being immediately referred, the nominations are instead listed in a special section of the Executive Calendar , a document distributed daily to congressional offices and available online. This section of the Calendar is titled ""Privileged Nominations."" After the chair of the committee with jurisdiction over a nomination has notified the executive clerk that biographical and financial information on the nominee has been received, this is indicated in the Calendar. After 10 days, the nomination is moved from the ""Privileged Nominations"" section of the Calendar and placed on the ""Nominations"" section with the same status as a nomination that had been reported by a committee. (See "" Executive Calendar "" below.) Importantly, at any time that the nomination is listed in the new section of the Executive Calendar , any Senator can request that a nomination be referred, and it is then sent to the appropriate committee of jurisdiction. Formally the presiding officer, but administratively the executive clerk's office, refers the nominations to committees according to the Senate's rules and precedents. The Senate rule concerning committee jurisdictions (Rule XXV) broadly defines issue areas for committees, and the same jurisdictional statements generally apply to nominations as well as legislation. An executive department nomination can be expected to be referred to the committee with jurisdiction over legislation concerning that department or to the committee that handled the legislation creating the position. Judicial branch nominations, including judges, U.S. attorneys, and U.S. marshals, are under the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. In some instances, the committee of jurisdiction for a nomination has been set in statute. The number of nominations referred to various committees differs considerably. The Committee on Armed Services, which handles all military appointments and promotions, receives the most. The two other committees with major confirmation responsibilities are the Committee on the Judiciary, with its jurisdiction over nominations in the judicial branch, and the Committee on Foreign Relations, which considers ambassadorial and other diplomatic appointments. Occasionally, nominations are referred to more than one committee, either jointly or sequentially. A joint referral might occur when the jurisdictional claim of two committees is essentially equal. In such cases, both committees must report on the nomination before the whole Senate can act on it, unless the Senate discharges one or both committees. If two committees have unequal jurisdictional claims, then the nomination is more likely to be sequentially referred. In this case, the first committee must report the nomination before it is sequentially referred to the second committee. The second referral often is subject to a requirement that the committee report within a certain number of days. Typically, nominations are jointly or sequentially referred by unanimous consent. Sometimes the unanimous consent agreement applies to all future nominations to a position or category of positions. Most Senate committees that consider nominations have written rules concerning the process. Although committee rules vary, most contain standards concerning information to be gathered from a nominee. Many committees expect a biographical resumé and some kind of financial statement listing assets and liabilities. Some specify the terms under which financial statements will or will not be made public. Committee rules also frequently contain timetables outlining the minimum layover required between committee actions. A common timing provision is a requirement that nominations be held for one or two weeks before the committee proceeds to a hearing or a vote, permitting Senators time to review a nomination before committee consideration. Other committee rules specifically mandate a delay between steps of the process, such as the receipt of pre-hearing information and the date of the hearing, or the distribution of hearing transcripts and the committee vote on the nomination. Some of the written rules also contain provisions for the rules to be waived by majority vote, by unanimous consent, or by the chair and the ranking minority Member. Committees often gather and review information about a nominee either before or instead of a formal hearing. Because the executive branch acts first in selecting a nominee, congressional committees are sometimes able to rely partially on any field investigations and reports conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Records of FBI investigations are provided only to the White House, although a report or a summary of a report may be shared, with the President's authorization, with Senators on the relevant committee. The practices of the committees with regard to FBI materials vary. Some rarely if ever request them. On other committees, the chair and ranking Member review any FBI report or summary, but on some committees these materials are available to any Senator upon request. Committee staff usually do not review FBI materials. Almost all nominees are also asked by the Office of the Counsel to the President to complete an ""Executive Personnel Financial Disclosure Report, SF-278,"" which is reviewed and certified by the relevant agency as well as the Director of the Office of Government Ethics. The documents are then forwarded to the relevant committee, along with opinion letters from ethics officers in the relevant agency and the director of the Office of Government Ethics. In contrast to FBI reports, financial disclosure forms are made public. All committees review financial disclosure reports and some make them available in committee offices to Members, staff, and the public. To varying degrees, committees also conduct their own information-gathering exercises. Some committees, after reviewing responses to their standard questionnaire, might ask a nominee to complete a second questionnaire. Committees frequently require that written responses to these questionnaires be submitted before a hearing is scheduled. The Committee on the Judiciary sends form letters, sometimes called ""blue slips,"" to Senators from a nominee's home state to determine whether they support the nomination. The Committee on the Judiciary also has its own investigative staff. The Committee on Rules and Administration handles relatively few nominations and conducts its own investigations, sometimes with the assistance of the FBI or the Government Accountability Office (GAO). It is not unusual for nominees to meet with committee staff prior to a hearing. High-level nominees may meet privately with Senators. Generally speaking, these meetings, sometimes initiated by the nominee, serve basically to acquaint the nominee with the Members and committee staff, and vice versa. They occasionally address substantive matters as well. A nominee also might meet with the committee's chief counsel to discuss the financial disclosure report and any potential conflict-of-interest issues. Historically, approximately half of all civilian appointees were confirmed without a hearing. All committees that receive nominations do hold hearings on some nominations, and the likelihood of hearings varies with the importance of the position and the workload of the committee. The Committee on the Judiciary, for example, which receives a large number of nominations, does not usually hold hearings for U.S. attorneys, U.S. marshals, or members of part-time commissions. The Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, on the other hand, typically hold hearings on most nominations that are referred to them. Committees often combine related nominations into a single hearing. The length and nature of hearings varies. One or both home-state Senators will often introduce a nominee at a hearing. The nominee typically testifies at the hearing, and occasionally the committee will invite other witnesses, including Members of the House of Representatives, to testify as well. Some hearings function as routine welcomes, while others are directed at influencing the policy program of an appointee. In addition to policy views, hearings might address the nominee's qualifications and potential conflicts of interest. Senators also might take the opportunity to ask questions of particular concern to them or their constituents. Committees sometimes send questions to nominees in advance of a hearing and ask for written responses. Nominees also might be asked to respond in writing to additional questions after a hearing. Especially for high-level positions, the nomination hearing may be only the first of many times an individual will be asked to testify before a committee. Therefore, the committee often gains a commitment from the nominee to be cooperative with future oversight activities of the committee. Hearings, under Senate Rule XXVI, are open to the public unless closed by majority vote for one of the reasons specified in the rule. Witness testimony is sometimes made available online through the website of the relevant committee and also through several commercial services, including Congressional Quarterly. Most committees print the hearings, although no rule requires it. The number of Senators necessary to constitute a quorum for the purpose of taking testimony varies from committee to committee, but it is usually smaller than a majority of the membership. A committee considering a nomination has four options. It may report the nomination to the Senate favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation, or it may choose to take no action at all. It is more common for a committee to take no action on a nomination than to report unfavorably. Particularly for policymaking positions, committees sometimes report a nomination favorably, subject to the commitment of the nominee to testify before a Senate committee. Sometimes, committees choose to report a nomination without recommendation. Even if a majority of Senators on a committee do not agree that a nomination should be reported favorably, a majority might agree to report a nomination without a recommendation in order to permit a vote by the whole Senate. The timing of a vote to report a nomination varies in accordance with committee rules and practice. Most committees do not vote to report a nomination on the same day that they hold a hearing, but instead wait until the next meeting of the committee. Senate Rule XXVI, clause 7(a)(1) requires that a quorum for making a recommendation on a nomination consist of a majority of the membership of the committee. In most cases, the number of Senators necessary to constitute a quorum for making a recommendation on a nomination to the Senate is the same that the committee requires for reporting a measure. Every committee reports a majority of nominations favorably. Most of the time, committees do not formally present reports on nominations on the floor of the Senate. Instead, committee staff prepare the appropriate paperwork on behalf of the committee chair and file it with the clerk. The executive clerk then arranges for the nomination to be printed in the Congressional Record and placed on the Executive Calendar . If a report were presented on the floor, it would have to be done in executive session. Executive session and the Executive Calendar will be discussed in the next section. According to Senate Rule XXXI, the Senate cannot vote on a nomination the same day it is reported except by unanimous consent. It is fairly common for the Senate to discharge a committee from consideration of an unreported nomination by unanimous consent. This removes the nomination from the committee in order to allow the full Senate to consider it. When the Senate discharges a committee by unanimous consent, it is doing so with the support of the committee for the purposes of simplifying the process. It is unusual for Senators to attempt to discharge a committee by motion or resolution, instead of by unanimous consent, and only a few attempts have ever been successful. Senate Rule XVII does permit any Senator to submit a motion or resolution that a committee be discharged from the consideration of a subject referred to it. The discharge process, however, does not allow a simple majority to quickly initiate consideration of a nomination still in committee. It requires several steps and, most notably, a motion or resolution to discharge is debatable. This means that a cloture process may be necessary to discharge a committee. Cloture on a discharge motion or resolution requires the support of three-fifths of the Senate, usually 60 Senators, and several days. The Senate handles executive business, which includes both nominations and treaties, separately from its legislative business. All nominations reported from committee, regardless of whether they were reported favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation, are listed on the Executive Calendar , a separate document from the Calendar of Business , which lists pending bills and resolutions. Usually, the majority leader schedules the consideration of nominations on the Calendar. Nominations are considered in executive session, a parliamentary form of the Senate in session that has its own journal and, to some extent, its own rules of procedure. After a committee reports a nomination or is discharged from considering it, the nomination is assigned a number by the executive clerk and placed on the Executive Calendar . Under a standing order of the Senate, certain nominations might also be placed in this status on the Executive Calendar after certain informational and time requirements are met. The list of nominations in the Executive Calendar includes basic information such as the name and office of the nominee, the name of the previous holder of the office, and whether the committee reported the nomination favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation. Long lists of routine nominations are printed in the Congressional Record and identified only by a short title in the Executive Calendar , such as ""Foreign Service nominations (84) beginning John F. Aloia, and ending Paul G. Churchill."" In addition to reported nominations and treaties, the Executive Calendar contains the text of any unanimous consent agreements concerning executive business. The Executive Calendar is distributed to Senate personal offices and committee offices when there is business on it. It is also available online by following the link to ""Calendars and Schedules"" on the Virtual Reference Desk under the Reference tab of the Senate website (www.Senate.gov) . Business on the Executive Calendar , which consists of nominations and treaties, is considered in executive session. In contrast, all measures and matters associated with lawmaking are considered in legislative session. Until 1929 executive sessions were also closed to the public, but now they are open unless ordered otherwise by the Senate. The Senate usually begins the day in legislative session and enters executive session either by a non-debatable motion or, far more often, by unanimous consent. Only if the Senate adjourned or recessed while in executive session would the next meeting automatically open in executive session. The motion to go into executive session can be offered at any time, is not debatable, and cannot be laid upon the table. All business concerning nominations, including seemingly routine matters such as requests for joint referral or motions to print hearings, must be done in executive session. In practice, Senators often make such motions or unanimous consent requests ""as if in executive session."" These usually brief proceedings during a legislative session do not constitute an official executive session. In addition, at the start of each Congress, the Senate adopts a standing order, by unanimous consent, that allows the Senate to receive nominations from the President and for them to be referred to committees even on days when the Senate does not meet in executive session. The majority leader, by custom, makes most motions and requests that determine when or whether a nomination will be called up for consideration. For example, the majority leader may move or ask unanimous consent to ""immediately proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination on the Executive Calendar.... "" By precedent, the motion to go into executive session to take up a specified nomination is not debatable. The nomination itself, however, is debatable. It is not in order for a Senator to move to consider a nomination that is not on the Calendar, and, except by unanimous consent, a nomination on the Calendar cannot be taken up until it has been on the Calendar at least one day (Rule XXXI, clause 1). A day for this purpose is a calendar day. In other words, a nomination reported and placed on the Calendar on a Monday can be considered on Tuesday, even if it is the same legislative day. If the Senate simply resolved into executive session, the business immediately pending would be the first item on the Executive Calendar . A motion to proceed to another matter on the Calendar would be debatable and subject to a filibuster. For this reason, the Senate does not begin consideration of executive business this way. Instead, the motion made to call up a nomination is a motion to proceed to executive session to consider that specific nomination. If the Senate is already in executive session, and the Leader wishes to call up a nomination, the Leader will first move that the Senate enter legislative session and then that the Senate enter executive session to take up the nomination. Both motions (to enter legislative session and to enter executive session) are not subject to debate and are decided by a simple majority. Typically they are approved by voice vote. The question before the Senate when a nomination is taken up is ""will the Senate advise and consent to this nomination?"" The Senate can approve or reject a nomination. A majority of Senators present and voting, a quorum being present, is required to approve a nomination. According to Senate Rule XXXI, any Senator who voted with the majority on the nomination has the option of moving to reconsider a vote on the day of the vote or the next two days the Senate meets in executive session. Only one motion to reconsider is in order on each nomination, and often the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table, by unanimous consent, shortly after the vote on the nomination. This action prevents any subsequent attempt to reconsider. After the Senate acts on a nomination, the Secretary of the Senate attests to a resolution of confirmation or disapproval and transmits it to the White House. Many nominations are brought up by unanimous consent and approved without objection; routine nominations often are grouped by unanimous consent in order to be brought up and approved together, or en bloc . A small proportion of nominations, generally to higher-level positions, may need more consideration. When there is debate on a nomination, the chair of the committee usually makes an opening speech. For positions within a state, Senators from the state may wish to speak on the nominee, particularly if they were involved in the selection process. Under Senate rules, there are no time limits on debate except when conducted under cloture or a unanimous consent agreement. Senate Rule XXII provides a means to bring debate on a nomination to a close, if necessary. Under the terms of Rule XXII, at least 16 Senators sign a cloture motion to end debate on a pending nomination. The motion proposed is ""to bring to a close the debate upon [the pending nomination]."" A Senator can interrupt a Senator who is speaking to present a cloture motion. Cloture may be moved only on a question that is pending before the Senate; therefore, absent unanimous consent, the Senate must be in executive session and considering the nomination when the motion is filed. After the clerk reads the motion, the Senate returns to the business it was considering before the presentation of the motion. Unless a unanimous consent agreement provides otherwise, the Senate does not vote on the cloture motion until the second day of session after the day it is presented; for example, if the motion was presented on a Monday, the Senate would act on it on Wednesday. One hour after the Senate has convened on the day the motion ""ripened,"" the presiding officer can interrupt the proceedings during an executive session to present a cloture motion for a vote. If the Senate is in legislative session when the time arrives for voting on the cloture motion, it proceeds into executive session prior to taking action on the cloture petition. According to Rule XXII, the presiding officer first directs the clerk to call the roll to ascertain that a quorum is present, although this requirement is often waived by unanimous consent. Senators then vote either yea or nay on the question: ""Is it the sense of the Senate that the debate shall be brought to a close?"" In April 2017, the Senate reinterpreted Rule XXII in order to allow cloture to be invoked on all nominations by a majority of Senators voting (a quorum being present), including Supreme Court justice nominations. This expanded the results of similar actions taken by the Senate in November 2013, which changed the cloture vote requirement to a majority for nominations except to the Supreme Court. Once cloture is invoked, for most nominations there can be a maximum of two hours of post-cloture consideration. The two hour maximum includes debate as well as any actions taken while the nomination is formally pending, including quorum calls. If cloture is invoked on nominations to the highest ranking executive branch positions, or on nominations to the Supreme Court or the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, then the maximum time for consideration after cloture is invoked is 30 hours (see Table 1 ). Under the rule, the 2 or 30 hours is floor time spent considering the nomination in the Senate, not simply the passage of time. Thus, for time to count against the 2 or 30-hour maximum, the Senate must be in session and the question must be pending. Time spent in recess or adjournment does not count, and if the Senate were to take up other business by unanimous consent, the time spent on that other business also would not count against the post-cloture time. A hold is a request by a Senator to his or her party leader to prevent or delay action on a nomination or a bill. Holds are not mentioned in the rules or precedents of the Senate, and they are enforced only through the agenda decisions of party leaders. A standing order of the Senate aims to ensure that any Senator who places a hold on any matter (including a nomination) make public his or her objection to the matter. Senators have placed holds on nominations for a number of reasons. One common purpose is to give a Senator more time to review a nomination or to consult with the nominee. Senators may also place holds because they disagree with the policy positions of the nominee. Senators have also admitted to using holds in order to gain concessions from the executive branch on matters not directly related to the nomination. The Senate precedents reducing the threshold necessary to invoke cloture on nominations, and the recent precedent reducing the time necessary for a cloture process, could affect the practice of holds. In some sense, holds are connected to the Senate traditions of mutual deference, since they may have originated as requests for more time to examine a pending nomination or bill. The effectiveness of a hold, however, ultimately has been grounded in the power of the Senator placing the hold to filibuster the nomination and the difficulty of invoking cloture to overcome a filibuster. Invoking cloture is now easier because the support of fewer Senators is necessary, and in most cases, the floor time required for a cloture process is less. The large number of nominations submitted by the President for Senate consideration, however, might still lead Senators to seek unanimous consent to quickly approve nominations. On April 3, 2019, the Senate reinterpreted Senate Rule XXII to reduce, from 30 hours to 2 hours, the maximum time allowed for consideration of most nominations after cloture is invoked. The Senate took this step by reversing two rulings by the Presiding Officer. The first vote established that ""postcloture time under rule XXII for all executive branch nominations other than a position at level 1 of the Executive Schedule under section 5312 of title 5 of the United States Code is 2 hours."" On the second vote, the Senate established that ""postcloture time under rule XXII for all judicial nominations, other than circuit courts or Supreme Court of the United States, is 2 hours"" (see Table 1 ). It is uncommon for the Senate to reverse a decision by the Presiding Officer. Any Senator can attempt to reverse a ruling by making an appeal, and except in specific cases, appeals are decided by majority vote. In most circumstances, however, appeals are debatable, and therefore supermajority support (through a cloture process) is typically necessary to reach a vote to reverse a decision of the Presiding Officer. In the April 3 proceedings, however, the appeal was raised after cloture had been invoked. Senate Rule XXII states that after a successful cloture vote, ""appeals from the decision of the Presiding Officer, shall be decided without debate."" Therefore, when the Majority Leader appealed the rulings of the Presiding Officer, the questions on whether the ruling should stand as the judgment of the Senate received a vote without an opportunity for extended debate. The Senate voted that the ruling should not stand, and thereby upheld instead the position of the Majority Leader. The future impact of these decisions on the nominations process is difficult to assess. The immediate and obvious expected impact is that the time between a cloture vote and a confirmation vote will decrease. In recent years, a vote to confirm a nominee has typically occurred the day after cloture was invoked (or on the next day of Senate session). Usually, Senators did not spend all of the time between the votes debating the nomination. Instead, Senators typically debated the nomination for some time post-cloture, but also usually entered into unanimous consent agreements that affected when the vote would occur. For example, it became common in recent Congresses for the Senate to agree, by unanimous consent, to consider the time the Senate spent in adjournment or recesses (e.g., overnight) to count as post-cloture time. The cloture rule affected the time of the vote set by unanimous consent: the rule provided for up to 30 hours of consideration of the nomination, and the Senate would agree to vote on the nomination a day later—reflecting the approximate time that the Senate could have debated the nomination under the rule. Assuming the Senate continues to establish times for voting on nominations by unanimous consent, those negotiations will be affected by the reinterpretation of the rule. In the absence of a unanimous consent agreement, most nominations can now receive a vote two hours after a vote to invoke cloture. The two hours is not formally divided between the parties pursuant to the rule (or pursuant to the reinterpretation of the rule), but it might be divided, by unanimous consent, between the Majority and Minority Leader. Even without an explicit unanimous consent agreement, the Majority and Minority Leaders are recognized before any other Senators. In addition, a Senator can speak for a maximum of one hour post-cloture. As a result, the Majority Leader could claim the first hour, and the Minority Leader the second, or vice versa. (Of course, Senators could speak on a nomination at times other than after cloture has been invoked, even when the nomination is not formally pending before the Senate. ) It is also possible that the recent reinterpretation of the rule will affect how often the Senate relies on the cloture process to approve nominations. After the first reinterpretation of the cloture rule in 2013, the number of nominations subjected to cloture motions increased significantly in both of the Congresses when the Senate was controlled by the same party as the President (113 th (2013-2014) and 115 th (2017-2018) Congresses). Nominations that are not confirmed or rejected are returned to the President at the end of a session or when the Senate adjourns or recesses for more than 30 days (Senate Rule XXXI, paragraph 6). If the President still wants a nominee considered, he must submit a new nomination to the Senate. The Senate can, however, waive this rule by unanimous consent, and it often does to allow nominations to remain ""in status quo"" between the first and second sessions of a Congress or during a long recess. The majority leader or his designee also may exempt specific nominees by name from the unanimous consent agreement, allowing them to be returned during the recess or adjournment. The Constitution, in Article II, Section 2, grants the President the authority to fill temporarily vacancies that ""may happen during the Recess of the Senate."" These appointments do not require the advice and consent of the Senate; the appointees temporarily fill the vacancies without Senate confirmation. In most cases, recess appointees have also been nominated to the positions to which they were appointed. Furthermore, when a recess appointment is made of an individual previously nominated to the position, the President usually submits a new nomination to the Senate in order to comply with a provision of law affecting the pay of recess appointees (5 U.S.C. 5503(a)). Recess appointments have sometimes been controversial and have occasionally led to inter-branch conflict.\n\n","['Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution provides that the President shall appoint officers of the United States ""by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate."" This report describes the process by which the Senate provides advice and consent on presidential nominations, including receipt and referral of nominations, committee practices, and floor procedure. Committees play the central role in the process through investigations and hearings. Senate Rule XXXI provides that nominations shall be referred to appropriate committees ""unless otherwise ordered."" Most nominations are referred, although a Senate standing order provides that some ""privileged"" nominations to specified positions will not be referred unless requested by a Senator. The Senate rule concerning committee jurisdictions (Rule XXV) broadly defines issue areas for committees, and the same jurisdictional statements generally apply to nominations as well as legislation. A committee often gathers information about a nominee either before or instead of a formal hearing. A committee considering a nomination has four options. It can report the nomination to the Senate favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation, or it can choose to take no action. It is more common for a committee to take no action on a nomination than to reject a nominee outright. The Senate handles executive business, which includes both nominations and treaties, separately from its legislative business. All nominations reported from committee are listed on the Executive Calendar, a separate document from the Calendar of Business, which lists pending bills and resolutions. Generally speaking, the majority leader schedules floor consideration of nominations on the Calendar. Nominations are considered in ""executive session,"" a parliamentary form of the Senate in session that has its own journal and, to some extent, its own rules of procedure. The Senate can call up a nomination expeditiously, because a motion to enter executive session to consider a specific nomination on the Calendar is not debatable. This motion requires a majority of Senators present and voting, a quorum being present, for approval. After a nomination has been called up, the question before the Senate is ""will the Senate advise and consent to this nomination?"" A majority of Senators voting is required to approve a nomination. However, Senate rules place no limit on how long a nomination may be debated, and ending consideration could require invoking cloture. On April 6, 2017, the Senate reinterpreted Rule XXII in order to allow cloture to be invoked on nominations to the Supreme Court by a majority of Senators voting. This expanded the results of similar actions taken by the Senate in November 2013, which changed the cloture vote requirement to a majority for nominations other than to the Supreme Court. After the 2013 decision, the number of nominations subjected to a cloture process increased. On April 3, 2019, the Senate reinterpreted Rule XXII again. The Senate reduced, from 30 hours to 2 hours, the maximum time nominations can be considered after cloture has been invoked. This change applied to all executive branch nominations except to high-level positions such as heads of departments, and it applied to all judicial nominations except to the Supreme Court and the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The full impact of this change is difficult to assess at this time, but it is likely to shorten the time between a cloture vote and a vote on the nomination. If Senators respond as they did to the last reinterpretation of the cloture rule, it might also increase the number of nominations subjected to a cloture process. Nominations that are pending when the Senate adjourns sine die at the end of a session or recesses for more than 30 days are returned to the President unless the Senate, by unanimous consent, waives the rule requiring their return (Senate Rule XXXI, clause 6). If a nomination is returned, and the President still desires Senate consideration, he must submit a new nomination.']","5595","gov_report","en","None","df430577a7eaa9e6745391a4fe8c576cac1cad10fde42515","Summary:","gov_report","532","\nThe report discusses the confirmation and confirmation process of presidential nominations in the United States.

"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nThe Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) requires that private-sector firms provide workers' compensation coverage for their employees engaged in longshore, harbor, or other maritime occupations on or adjacent to the navigable waters of the United States. Although the LHWCA program is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), most benefits are paid either through private insurers or self-insured firms. The LHWCA is a workers' compensation system and not a federal benefits program. Like other workers' compensation systems in the United States, the LHWCA ensures that all covered workers are provided medical and disability benefits in the event they are injured or become ill in the course of their employment, and it provides benefits to the survivors of covered workers who die on the job. In 2016, the LHWCA paid approximately $1.41 billion in cash and medical benefits to injured workers and the families of deceased workers. Nearly all private- and public-sector workers in the United States are covered by some form of workers' compensation. The federal government has a limited role in workers' compensation and administers workers' compensation programs only for federal employees and several classes of private-sector workers, including longshore and harbor workers. For most occupations, workers' compensation is mandated by state laws and administered by state agencies. There is no federal mandate that states provide workers' compensation. However, every state and the District of Columbia has a workers' compensation system. There are no federal standards for state workers' compensation systems. However, all U.S. workers' compensation systems provide for limited wage replacement and full medical benefits for workers who are injured or become ill as a result of their work and survivors benefits to the families of workers who die on the job. Workers' compensation in the United States is a no-fault system that pays workers for employment-related injuries or illnesses without considering the culpability of any one party. In exchange for this no-fault protection and the guarantee of benefits in the event of an employment-related injury, illness, or death, workers give up their rights to bring actions against employers in the civil court system and give up their rights to seek damages for injuries and illnesses, including pain and suffering, outside of those provided by the workers' compensation laws. Workers' compensation is mandatory in all states and the District of Columbia, with the exception of Texas. In Texas, employers may, under certain conditions, opt out of the workers' compensation system, but in doing so subject themselves to civil actions brought by injured employees. Prior to the enactment of the LHWCA in 1927, longshore and harbor workers were not covered by any workers' compensation system. Although persons who worked entirely on land were covered by workers' compensation laws in those states that enacted such laws, pursuant to the Supreme Court's 1917 decision in Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen , state workers' compensation systems did not have jurisdiction over persons working on the ""navigable waters"" of the United States because the Constitution granted the authority over ""matters of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction"" to the federal government. The LHWCA created a federal workers' compensation program to cover these workers. In 1972, the LHWCA zone of coverage was extended to include areas adjacent to navigable waters that are used for loading, unloading, repairing, or building vessels. The LHWCA provisions apply to any private firm with any covered employees who work, full- or part-time, on the navigable waters of the United States, including in any of the following adjoining areas: piers; wharves; dry docks; terminals; building ways; marine railways; or other areas customarily used in the loading, unloading, repairing, or building of vessels. With the exception of workers excluded by statute (listed below), the LHWCA covers any maritime employee of a covered firm, including longshore workers (those who load and unload ships) and harbor workers (i.e., ship repairmen, ship builders, and ship breakers). Sections 2(3) and 3(b) of the LHWCA exclude the following workers from coverage: Workers covered by a state workers' compensation law, including employees exclusively engaged in clerical, secretarial, security, or data processing work; persons employed by a club, camp, recreational operation, museum, or retail outlet; marina employees not engaged in the construction, replacement, or expansion of the marina; suppliers, transporters, and vendors doing business temporarily at the site of a covered employer; aquaculture workers; and employees who build any recreational vessel under 65 feet in length, or repair any recreational vessel, or dismantle any part of a recreational vessel in connection with the repair of the vessel. Workers, whether covered or not covered by a state workers' compensation law, including masters and crew members of vessels; persons engaged by the master of a vessel to unload any vessel under 18 tons net; and employees of the federal government, or any state, local, or foreign government or any subdivision of such a government. Section 803 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) modified one of the excluded classes of workers under the LHWCA by adding additional exclusions for persons who work on recreational vessels over 65 feet in length. Prior to the amendment, Section 2(3)(F) of the LHWCA read as follows: (3) The term ""employee"" means…but such term does not include… (F) individuals employed to build, repair, or dismantle any recreational vessel under sixty-five feet in length. This section, as amended, reads as follows (with additions in italics): (3) The term ""employee"" means…but such term does not include… (F) individuals employed to build any recreational vessel under sixty-five feet in length, or individuals employed to repair any recreational vessel, or to dismantle any part of a recreational vessel in connection with the repair of such vessel. By granting an exemption from the LHWCA to persons engaged in the repair of any recreation vessel, regardless of its size, this amendment limits the scope of the LHWCA and increases the types of workers excluded from coverage. In 2011, the DOL promulgated implementing regulations for the new recreational vessel provision provided by Section 803 of ARRA. These regulations provided definitions of recreational vessel for the purposes of the determination of LHWCA coverage. These definitions are based on the classification of vessels used by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and provided in statute and regulation. Specifically, under these current DOL regulations, a vessel is considered a recreational vessel if the vessel is being manufactured or operated mainly for pleasure or leased, rented, or chartered to another person for his or her pleasure. In addition, for a vessel being built or repaired under warranty by its manufacturer or builder, the vessel is considered a recreational vessel if it appears based on its design and construction to be intended for recreational uses. The manufacturer or builder bears the burden under this regulation to establish that the vessel is a recreational vessel. For a vessel being repaired, dismantled for repair, or dismantled at the end of its life (ship breaking), the vessel is not considered a recreational vessel if it was operating, more than infrequently, in one of the following categories provided in the U.S. Code : ""passenger vessel"" (46 U.S.C. §2101(22)); ""small passenger vessel"" (46 U.S.C. §2101(35)); ""uninspected passenger vessel"" (46 U.S.C. §2101(42)); vessel routinely engaged in ""commercial service"" (46 U.S.C. §2101(5)); or vessel that routinely carries ""passengers for hire"" (46 U.S.C. §2101(21a)). A vessel being repaired, dismantled for repair, or dismantled at the end of its life is considered a recreational vessel if the vessel is a public vessel owned, or bareboat chartered, by the federal government or a state or local government and shares elements of design and construction with traditional recreational vessels and is not used for military or commercial purposes. Since the promulgation of the DOL's 2011 rules providing regulatory definitions of recreational vessels for the purposes of the LHWCA, numerous bills have been introduced that would, if enacted, remove the existing regulatory definitions for a vessel being repaired, dismantled for repair, or dismantled at the end of its life so that the USCG categories of vessels provided in Section 2101 of Title 46 of the United States Code would no longer be used in the classification of such a vessel under the LHWCA. This legislation would expand the types of recreational vessels. Because persons who work on recreational vessels are not covered by the LHWCA, the legislation would allow employers to purchase workers' compensation for these workers under state laws rather than the LHWCA, which, due to the more generous benefits frequently offered by the LHWCA and the limited number of providers, may be more expensive. In the 115 th Congress, Section 3509 of H.R. 2810 , the National Defense Authorization Act for 2018 (NDAA), as initially passed by the House of Representatives on July 14, 2017, contained this legislative provision. This provision was not included in the Senate version of the bill nor in the final NDAA enacted into law. The LHWCA has been amended four times to extend coverage to occupations outside the original scope of the law. In 1928, coverage was extended to employees of the District of Columbia . The provision was repealed, effective for all injuries occurring on or after July 26, 1982, with the enactment by the District of Columbia government of the District of Columbia Workers' Compensation Act of 1982. Benefits for injuries that occurred prior to July 26, 1982, continue to be paid under the LHWCA. Coverage was extended to overse a s military and public works contractors in 1941 with the enactment of the Defense Base Act. In 1952, coverage was extended to civilian employees of nonappropriated fund instrumentalities of the armed forces , such as service clubs and post exchanges. Coverage was extended in 1953 to employees working on the Outer Continental Shelf in the exploration and the development of natural resources , such as workers on offshore oil platforms. Employers required by the LHWCA to provide workers' compensation coverage to their employees may either purchase private insurance or self-insure. The DOL is responsible for authorizing insurance carriers to provide coverage under the LHWCA program and for authorizing companies to self-insure. However, the DOL does not set or regulate insurance premiums. These insurance arrangements are the primary means of providing LHWCA benefits to injured, sick, and deceased workers and their families. General revenue is not used to pay any LHWCA benefits. The DOL operates the Special Fund to provide LHWCA benefits in cases in which the responsible employer or insurance carrier cannot pay or in which benefits must be paid for a second injury under Section 8(f) of the LHWCA. The Special Fund is financed through an annual assessment charged to employers and insurance carriers based on the previous year's claims, payments required when an employee dies without any survivors, disability payments due to an employee without survivors after his or her death, and penalties and fines assessed for noncompliance with LHWCA program rules. The administrative costs associated with the LHWCA are largely provided by general revenue. General revenue is used to pay for most oversight functions associated with the LHWCA and the processing of LHWCA claims. General revenue is also used to pay legal and investigative costs associated with the DOL Office of the Solicitor and Office of the Inspector General. Revenue from the Special Fund is used to finance oversight activities related to the Special Fund and the program's vocational rehabilitation activities. In 2016, total administrative costs associated with the LHWCA were approximately $15.8 million, of which $13.6 million, or 86%, was paid by general revenue and $2.2 million, or 14%, was paid by the Special Fund. The LHWCA provides medical benefits for covered injuries and illnesses and disability benefits to partially cover wages lost due to covered injuries or illnesses, and it provides survivors benefits to the families of workers who die on the job. The LHWCA provides medical benefits to fully cover the cost of any medical treatment associated with a covered injury or illness. These medical benefits are provided without any deductibles, copayments, or costs paid by the injured worker. Prescription drugs and medical procedures are fully covered, as are costs associated with travelling to and from medical appointments. A covered worker may select his or her own treating physician, provided the physician has not been debarred from the LHWCA program for violating program rules. Covered workers are entitled to vocational rehabilitation services provided under the LHWCA. Vocational rehabilitation services are designed to assist the covered worker in returning to employment. There is no cost to the covered worker for vocational rehabilitation and workers actively participating in a rehabilitation program are entitled to an additional benefit of $25 per week. All costs associated with vocational rehabilitation under the LHWCA are paid out of the Special Fund. Vocational rehabilitation services may be provided by public or private rehabilitation agencies. The LHWCA provides disability benefits to covered workers to partially cover wages lost due to the inability to work because of a covered injury or illness. The amount of disability benefits is based on the worker's pre-disability wage, subject to maximum and minimum benefits based on the National Average Weekly Wage (NAWW) as determined by the DOL. The NAWW is updated October 1 of each year and is based on average wages across the United States for the three calendar quarters ending on June 30 of that year. The minimum weekly benefit that can be paid to a covered employee is equal to 50% of the NAWW and the maximum weekly benefit that can be paid is equal to 200% of the NAWW. Disability benefits under the LHWCA, like all workers' compensation benefits, are not subject to federal income taxes. Unlike most state workers' compensation benefits, however, LHWCA benefits are adjusted based on wage inflation rather than price inflation. Benefits are adjusted annually each October 1 to reflect the change in the NAWW from the previous year, up to a maximum increase of 5%. The LHWCA provides benefits in cases of total disability. Under the LHWCA, a worker is considered totally disabled if he or she is unable to earn his or her pre-injury wage because of a covered injury or illness. In addition, a worker is also considered totally disabled if he or she loses both hands, arms, feet, legs, or eyes, or any two of these body systems, such as the loss of one arm and one leg. Total disability benefits under the LHWCA are equal to two-thirds of the covered worker's wage at the time of the injury or illness. Total disability benefits continue until the worker is no longer totally disabled or dies. If a covered worker is able to partially return to work or return to work at a wage level less than his or her wage at the time of injury, then he or she is considered partially disabled. In cases of temporary partial disability, the LHWCA benefit is equal to two-thirds of the difference between the workers' pre-injury wage and his or her current earning capacity or actual earnings. Section 8(c) of the LHWCA provides a schedule of benefits to be paid in cases of permanent partial disability (PPD), such as the loss of a limb. The benefit schedule provides the number of weeks of compensation, at two-thirds of the pre-injury wage, for each type of PPD. For example, the LHWCA schedule provides that a worker who loses an arm is entitled to 312 weeks of compensation. Benefits in cases not listed on the schedule are paid at two-thirds of the difference between the pre-injury wage and current earning capacity for the duration of the disability. Schedule benefits for PPD are paid regardless of the current work status or earnings capacity of the employee. Thus, an employee with a PPD can fully return to work and earn his or her wage in addition to the PPD compensation. A copy of the LHWCA PPD schedule can be found in the Appendix to this report. If a worker has an illness that was caused by his or her covered employment but did not manifest itself until after his or her retirement, then he or she is entitled to disability benefits equal to two-thirds of the NAWW multiplied by the percentage of his or her impairment. The percentage of impairment is determined using the current edition of the American Medical Association's Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (AMA Guides ), or another professionally recognized source if the condition is not listed in the AMA Guides. The LHWCA provides cash benefits to the surviving spouses and minor children of workers killed on the job. Benefits for a surviving spouse end when the spouse remarries or dies and benefits for surviving children continue until the children reach the age of 18, age 23 if a full-time student, or for the life a child with a disability. A surviving spouse with no eligible children is entitled to one-half of the deceased worker's wage at the time of death under the LHWCA. A surviving spouse with one or more eligible children is entitled to two-thirds of the deceased worker's wage at the time of death. Once all children become ineligible for benefits because of their ages, the surviving spouse's benefit is reduced to the level of a spouse without any eligible children. If an eligible spouse becomes ineligible for benefits because of death or remarriage, or if there is no surviving spouse, benefits are still paid to any surviving children. Under the LHWCA, a single surviving eligible child is entitled to one-half of the deceased worker's wage at the time of death, and two or more surviving children are eligible for a combined two-thirds of the wage at the time of death. The survivors of a covered worker killed on the job are entitled under the LHWCA to a cash payment to provide for the burial and funeral of the deceased. The burial and funeral allowance is capped by Section 9(a) of the LHWCA at $3,000, and this cap not adjusted to reflect changes in prices or wages. If a covered worker who is receiving scheduled PPD benefits dies of a cause unrelated to his or her illness or injury, then the balance of any remaining PPD benefits is paid to his or her survivors. If a covered worker who dies on the job leaves no survivors, his or her employer or the employer's insurance carrier is required to pay $5,000 into the Special Fund. Although the responsibility for the payment of benefits under the LHWCA rests with the employer or the employer's insurance company, decisions on benefit eligibility and the amount of benefits are made by the DOL. Upon the report of an injury, illness, or death, the LHWCA claims process begins. If the employer or insurance carrier does not controvert the claim, then arrangements are made by the DOL for the claim to be paid. If, however, the employer controverts any part of the claim, then the DOL sets up an informal conference, either in person or by phone, between the employer or insurance carrier and worker with the goal of resolving any disputes over the claim. If this informal conference fails to resolve all outstanding disputes, then a formal hearing before a DOL administrative law judge (ALJ) is scheduled. If the employer or insurance carrier or the worker is dissatisfied with the decision of the ALJ, then this decision may be appealed to the Benefits Review Board (BRB). The BRB is made up of five members appointed by the Secretary of Labor. Either party dissatisfied with the decision of the BRB may file a petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the injury occurred praying that the BRB's decision be set aside or modified. If an employer or insurance carrier fails to pay compensation in accordance with a final decision on a claim, the covered worker or the DOL may request that the U.S. District Court order that payment be made.\n\n","[""The Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) is a federal workers' compensation program that covers certain private-sector maritime workers. Firms that employ these workers are required to purchase workers' compensation or self-insure and are responsible for providing medical and disability benefits to covered workers who are injured or become ill on the job and survivors benefits to the families of covered workers who die on the job. The LHWCA is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), and all benefit costs are paid by employers and their insurance carriers. In 2016, more than $1.4 billion in LHWCA benefits were paid to beneficiaries. Congress has extended the LHWCA provisions to cover workers outside of the maritime industry, such as overseas government contractors and civilian employees of military post exchanges. As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), persons who repair recreational vessels of any size were added to the LHWCA exemption list. In 2011, the DOL implemented this provision; since then, those regulations have proven controversial and numerous bills have been introduced to modify the regulatory definition to increase the number of workers exempted from the LHWCA. The LHWCA pays for all medical care associated with a covered injury or illness. Disability benefits are based on a worker's pre-injury wage, and, unlike comparable state workers' compensation benefits, are adjusted annually to reflect national wage growth.""]","3317","gov_report","en","None","16ff170b05fee2ae75fd88537151adb7172c5aee0b809511","Summary:","gov_report","532","\nThe Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) is a federal workers' compensation program in the United States, administered by the Department of Labor (DOL).

"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nThis report describes and analyzes annual appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for FY2019. It compares the enacted FY2018 appropriations for DHS, the Donald J. Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request, and the appropriations measures developed and considered by Congress in response to it. This report identifies additional informational resources, reports, and products on DHS appropriations that provide context for the discussion, and it provides a list of Congressional Research Service (CRS) policy experts with whom clients may consult on specific topics. The suite of CRS reports on homeland security appropriations tracks legislative action and congressional issues related to DHS appropriations, with particular attention paid to discretionary funding amounts. These reports do not provide in-depth analysis of specific issues related to mandatory funding—such as retirement pay—nor do they systematically follow other legislation related to the authorizing or amending of DHS programs, activities, or fee revenues. Discussion of appropriations legislation involves a variety of specialized budgetary concepts. The Appendix to this report explains several of these concepts, including budget authority, obligations, outlays, discretionary and mandatory spending, offsetting collections, allocations, and adjustments to the discretionary spending caps under the Budget Control Act (BCA; P.L. 112-25 ). A more complete discussion of those terms and the appropriations process in general can be found in CRS Report R42388, The Congressional Appropriations Process: An Introduction , coordinated by James V. Saturno, and the Government Accountability Office's A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process . All amounts contained in the suite of CRS reports on homeland security appropriations represent budget authority. For precision in percentages and totals, all calculations in these reports used unrounded data, which are presented in each report's tables. However, amounts in narrative discussions are rounded to the nearest million (or 10 million, in the case of numbers larger than 1 billion), unless noted otherwise. Data used in this report for FY2018 amounts are derived from the explanatory statement accompanying P.L. 115-141 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017—Division F of which is the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018. The explanatory statement also includes data on FY2018 supplemental appropriations for DHS enacted prior to the development of the consolidated appropriations act for FY2018. Data for the FY2019 requested levels and enacted levels are drawn from H.Rept. 116-9 , the explanatory statement accompanying P.L. 116-6 . Data on the Senate Appropriations Committee recommendation are drawn from S.Rept. 115-283 , and data for the House Appropriations Committee recommendation are drawn from H.Rept. 115-948 . Scoring methodology is consistent across this report, relying on data provided by the Appropriations Committees that has been developed with Congressional Budget Office (CBO) methodology. CRS does not attempt to compare this data with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) data because technical scoring differences do not allow precise comparisons. This section provides an overview of the process of enactment of appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for FY2019, from the Administration's initial request, through committee action in the House and Senate, continuing appropriations (and their lapse), and enactment of the consolidated appropriations bill that contained DHS annual appropriation. On February 12, 2018, the Trump Administration released its budget request for FY2019. The enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 ( P.L. 115-123 ) three days before had established discretionary spending limits for FY2018 and FY2019, replacing the limits prescribed by the Budget Control Act of 2011 ( P.L. 112-25 ). The Administration chose to submit an addendum to their request in a letter accompanying the formal request documentation, which included additional requests for resources for DHS and several other departments and agencies. The Trump Administration requested $47.43 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS for FY2019, as part of an overall budget that the Office of Management and Budget estimated to be $74.88 billion (including fees, trust funds, and other funding that is not annually appropriated or does not score against discretionary budget limits). The request amounted to a $0.29 billion (0.6%) decrease from the $47.72 billion in annual appropriations enacted for FY2018 through the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018 ( P.L. 115-141 , Division F). The Trump Administration also requested discretionary funding for DHS components that does not count against discretionary spending limits set by the Budget Control Act (BCA; P.L. 112-25 ) and is not reflected in the above totals. The Administration requested an additional $6.65 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in disaster relief funding, as defined by the BCA, and in the budget request for the Department of Defense, $165 million in Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terror designated funding (OCO), to be transferred to the Coast Guard. On June 21, 2018, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported out S. 3109 , the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019, accompanied by S.Rept. 115-283 . Committee-reported S. 3109 included $48.33 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for FY2019. This was $901 million (1.9%) above the level requested by the Administration, and $611 million (1.3%) above the enacted level for FY2018. The Senate committee-reported bill also included the Administration-requested levels for disaster relief funding, and $163 million in OCO-designated funding directly for the Coast Guard, as had been done in FY2018, rather than as a transfer, as had been requested by the Administration. This bill was never taken up for action on the Senate floor. On July 26, 2018, the House Appropriations Committee marked up H.R. 6776 , its version of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019. H.Rept. 115-948 was filed September 12, 2018. Committee-reported H.R. 6776 included $51.44 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority. The House committee-reported bill included the Administration-requested levels for disaster relief funding, but unlike S. 3109 , did not include the OCO funding for the Coast Guard. This bill did not see action on the House floor. As some of the annual appropriations for FY2019 remained unfinished, a consolidated appropriations bill that included a continuing resolution was passed by Congress and signed into law on September 28, 2018, as P.L. 115-245 . The continuing resolution (Division C) continued funding for DHS at a rate of operations equal to that of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018, with some exceptions. The continuing resolution was extended through December 21, 2018, at which point it expired, and annual appropriations for DHS lapsed, resulting in a partial shutdown of DHS for 35 days. Continuing appropriations were restored at the FY2018 rate of operations with the enactment of P.L. 116-4 on January 25, 2019. On February 14, 2019, the House took up H.J.Res. 31 , a consolidated appropriations bill that included eight annual appropriations bills. Division A, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019, included $49.41 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, $1.69 billion (3.5%) more than had been provided for FY2018, and $2.04 billion more than had been requested by the Administration in February 2018. In addition to that total, the bill included $12 billion designated for the costs of major disasters—$5.35 billion (80.4%) more than had been requested, and the requested $165 million in OCO funding appropriated for the Coast Guard operating budget, rather than a transfer from the Navy. The bill passed the House by a vote of 300-128, and the Senate that same day by a vote of 83-16. The President signed it into law the next day. Generally, the homeland security appropriations bill includes all annual appropriations provided for DHS, allocating resources to every departmental component. Discretionary appropriations provide roughly two-thirds to three-fourths of the annual funding for DHS operations, depending how one accounts for disaster relief spending and funding for overseas contingency operations. The remainder of the budget is a mix of fee revenues, trust funds, and mandatory spending. Appropriations measures for DHS typically have been organized into five titles. The first four are thematic groupings of components, while the fifth provides general direction to the department, and sometimes includes provisions providing additional budget authority. Prior to the FY2017 act, the legislative language of many appropriations included directions to components or specific conditions on how the budget authority it provided could be used. Similarly, general provisions provided directions or conditions to one or more components. In the FY2017 act, a number of these provisions within appropriations and component-specific general provisions were grouped at the ends of the titles where their targeted components are funded, and identified as ""administrative provisions."" This practice has continued in subsequent years. When DHS was established in 2003, components of other agencies were brought together over a matter of months, in the midst of ongoing budget cycles. Rather than developing a new structure of appropriations for the entire department, Congress and the Administration continued to provide resources through existing account structures when possible. At the direction of Congress, in 2014 DHS began to work on a new Common Appropriations Structure (CAS), which would standardize the format of DHS appropriations across components. In an interim report in 2015, DHS noted that operating with ""over 70 different appropriations and over 100 Programs, Projects, and Activities ... has contributed to a lack of transparency, inhibited comparisons between programs, and complicated spending decisions and other managerial decision-making."" After several years of work and negotiations with Congress, DHS made its first budget request in the CAS for FY2017, and implemented it while operating under the continuing resolutions funding the department in October 2016. For FY2017 and FY2018, all DHS components requested appropriations under the CAS except for the Coast Guard, due to constraints of its financial management system. For FY2019, all the components' requests generally conformed to the CAS. A visual representation of the FY2019 requested funding in this new structure follows in Figure 1 . On the left, CAS appropriations categories are listed next to a black bar representing the total FY2018 funding levels requested for DHS for each category. A catch-all ""other"" category is included for budget authority associated with the legislation that does not fit the CAS categories. Colored lines flow to the DHS components listed on the right, showing how the amount of funding for each appropriations category is distributed across DHS components. Wider lines indicate greater funding levels, so it is possible to understand how components may be funded differently. For example, while Customs and Border Protection (CBP) gets most of its funding from Operations and Support appropriations, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) receives most of its discretionary funding from the Disaster Relief Fund appropriation. The following sections present textual and tabular comparisons among FY2018 enacted appropriations, FY2019 requested appropriations, the FY2019 appropriations bills developed by the appropriations committees, and the final enacted annual appropriation in Division A of the FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 116-6 ). The structure of the appropriations reflects the organization outlined in the detail table of the explanatory statement accompanying the act ( H.Rept. 116-9 ). The tables summarize enacted appropriations for FY2018, and those requested by the Administration, and proposed in appropriations committee-developed legislation under development for FY2019. Only the formal request for FY2019 annual appropriations is reflected in the ""Request"" column. The tables include data on enacted annual and supplemental appropriations. Instances where appropriations are provided for a title's components in other parts of the bill (such as in general provisions or by transfer) are shown separately. Supplemental appropriations provided with an emergency designation for a given component in FY2018 are displayed after the subtotal of annual appropriations. Following the methodology used by the appropriations committees, totals of ""appropriations"" do not include resources provided by transfer or under adjustments to discretionary spending limits (i.e., for emergency requirements, overseas contingency operations for the Coast Guard or the cost of major disasters under the Stafford Act for the Federal Emergency Management Agency). Amounts covered by adjustments are included with discretionary appropriations in a separate total for ""discretionary funding."" A subtotal for each component of total estimated budgetary resources that would be available under the legislation and from other sources (such as fees, mandatory spending, and trust funds) for the given fiscal year is also provided at the end of each component section. Totals at the bottom of each table indicate the total net discretionary appropriation for the title on its own, the total net discretionary funding from the annual appropriations bill and any supplemental appropriations (when such were provided), and the projected total estimated budgetary resources for each phase in the appropriations process shown in the table. Title I, Departmental Management and Operations, the smallest of the component-specific titles, contains appropriations for the Office of the Secretary and Executive Management, the Management Directorate, Analysis and Operations (A&O), and the Office of the Inspector General (OIG). For FY2018, these components received $1.36 billion in net discretionary funding through the appropriations process, including $25 million in FY2018 supplemental appropriations. The Trump Administration requested $1.60 billion in FY2019 net discretionary funding for components included in this title. In addition, $24 million was requested as a transfer from the FY2019 appropriation for the Disaster Relief Fund to the OIG. Not including the transfer, the appropriations request was $241 million (17.7%) more than the amount provided for FY2018. Senate Appropriations Committee-reported S. 3109 included $1.47 billion in FY2019 net discretionary funding for the components funded in this title. This was $137 million (8.6%) less than requested by the Trump Administration and $103 million (7.6%) more than the amount provided for FY2018. S. 3109 included $72 million in discretionary budget authority drawn from unobligated prior-year balances from the DRF, but did not include the proposed transfer of FY2019 DRF resources to the OIG. As a result, the gross budgetary resources provided to components funded in Title I was $89 million (5.5%) less than the request, and $176 million (12.9%) more than provided in FY2018. House Appropriations Committee-reported H.R. 6776 included $1.48 billion in FY2019 net discretionary funding for the components funded in this title. This was $119 million (7.4%) less than requested by the Trump Administration and $122 million (8.9%) more than the amount provided for FY2018. H.R. 6776 , like the Senate committee-reported bill, did not include the proposed transfer of FY2019 DRF resources to the OIG. As a result, the gross budgetary resources provided to components funded in Title I were $143 million (8.8%) less than the request, and $122 million (8.9%) more than provided in FY2018. P.L. 116-6 included a total of $1.88 billion in FY2019 net discretionary funding for the components funded in this title. This included $51 million in a general provision for financial systems modernization, controlled by the management directorate. The total was $513 million (37.7%) more than was provided in FY2018, and $248 million (15.2%) more than was requested by the Administration, if one included the Administration's proposed transfer of $24 million from the Disaster Relief Fund to the Office of the Inspector General. Table 1 shows these comparisons in greater detail. As resources were requested or provided for the Management Directorate and Office of the Inspector General in some cases from outside Title I, separate lines are included for each of those components showing a total for what is provided solely within Title I, then the individual items funded outside the title, followed by the total annual appropriation for the components. Title II, Security, Enforcement, and Investigations, contains appropriations for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the Coast Guard (USCG), and the U.S. Secret Service (USSS). Title II funding represents the majority of DHS's budget, comprising roughly three-quarters of the funding appropriated annually for the department. For FY2018, these components received $39.52 billion in net discretionary funding, as part of $47.13 billion in projected total budget authority. This included $1.06 billion in supplemental appropriations. The Trump Administration formally requested $38.41 billion in FY2019 net discretionary funding for components included in this title, as part of a total budget request for these components of $47.08 billion for FY2019. The funding request was $45 million (0.1%) less than the amount provided for FY2018, setting aside FY2018 supplemental appropriations. Again setting aside FY2018 supplemental appropriations, the total resources proposed for FY2019 was $1.01 billion (2.2%) more than projected for FY2018. The Administration reportedly sought additional funding in this title for construction of border barriers, above the formally requested level. In January 2019, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget sent a letter to congressional leaders officially seeking an additional $4.1 billion. Those amounts are not included in these comparative calculations or in the table below. Senate Appropriations Committee-reported S. 3109 included $38.68 billion in FY2019 net discretionary funding for the components funded in this title. This was $271 million (0.7%) more than formally requested by the Trump Administration and $227 million (0.6%) more than the amount provided for FY2018, setting aside FY2018 supplemental appropriations. The total budgetary resources projected under S. 3109 were $614 million (1.3%) less than the Administration's request (largely due to rejection of a proposed TSA fee increase), but $391 million (0.8%) more than projected for FY2018, again setting aside FY2018 supplemental appropriations. House Appropriations Committee-reported H.R. 6776 included $41.28 billion in FY2019 net discretionary funding for the components funded in this title. This was $2.87 billion (7.5%) more than formally requested by the Trump Administration and $2.82 billion (7.3%) more than the amount provided for FY2018, setting aside FY2018 supplemental appropriations. The total budgetary resources projected under H.R. 6776 were $2.08 billion (4.4%) more than formally requested by the Administration and $3.12 billion (6.8%) more than projected for FY2018, again setting aside FY2018 supplemental appropriations. H.R. 6776 would have provided $2.59 billion (6.7%) more than S. 3019 , largely due to the House Appropriations Committee recommending $3.35 billion more than its Senate counterpart for CBP's Border Security Assets and Infrastructure activity. P.L. 116-6 included $40.00 billion in net discretionary funding for the components funded in this title. The enacted annual appropriations were $1.59 billion (4.1%) more than requested, and $486 million (1.2%) more than the amount provided in FY2018. Setting aside FY2018 supplemental funding, FY2019 enacted net discretionary funding exceeded FY2018 levels by $1.55 billion (4.0%). The total budgetary resources projected for components funded in this title were $47.82 billion, $704 million (1.5%) more than was formally requested by the Administration, and $1.75 billion (3.8%) more than was provided in FY2018, setting aside the FY2018 supplemental funding. Table 2 shows these comparisons in greater detail. Title III, Protection, Preparedness, Response, and Recovery, contains appropriations for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Office of Health Affairs (OHA), and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). It is the second largest of the component-specific titles. For FY2018, these components received $7.22 billion in net discretionary appropriations and $7.37 billion in specially designated funding for disaster relief through the annual appropriations process. In addition to that annual funding, $58.23 billion was provided for FEMA in emergency supplemental appropriations in FY2018. Incorporating all these elements, the total net discretionary funding level for all Title III components was $72.61 billion for FY2018. The Trump Administration requested $6.19 billion in FY2019 net discretionary appropriations for components included in this title, and $6.65 billion in specially designated funding for disaster relief as part of a total net discretionary funding level for these components of $12.84 billion for FY2019. Setting aside the $58.23 billion in FY2018 supplemental appropriations, the appropriations request was $1.54 billion (10.7%) less than the amount provided for FY2018 in net discretionary funding. Senate Appropriations Committee-reported S. 3109 included $13.54 billion in FY2019 net discretionary funding for the components funded in this title. This was $694 million (5.4%) more than requested by the Trump Administration and $847 million (5.9%) less than the amount provided for FY2018, setting aside supplemental funding. The total budgetary resources projected would be $718 million (3.8%) more than the Administration's request, but $1.29 billion (6.2%) less than projected for FY2018, setting aside supplemental funding. The Senate committee-reported bill included within these totals the requested disaster relief funding of $6.65 billion, and offset $228 million in its Federal Assistance appropriation from unobligated DRF balances. House Appropriations Committee-reported H.R. 6776 included $13.70 billion in FY2019 net discretionary funding for the components funded in this title. This was $861 million (6.7%) more than requested by the Trump Administration and $681 million (4.7%) less than the amount provided for FY2018, setting aside supplemental funding. The total budgetary resources projected would be $885 million (4.7%) more than the Administration's request, but $1.13 billion (5.4%) less than projected for FY2018, setting aside supplemental funding. The House committee-reported bill included within these totals the requested disaster relief funding of $6.65 billion. P.L. 116-6 included $18.27 billion in FY2019 net discretionary funding for the components funded in this title. The enacted discretionary funding level was $5.43 billion (42.3%) more than requested, and $3.89 billion (27.1%) more than the amount provided for FY2018, setting aside the historically high level of supplemental appropriations. The total budgetary resources projected for FY2019 was $5.46 billion (29.0%) more than was requested, and $3.44 billion (16.5%) more than was projected for FY2018, setting aside FY2018 supplemental funding. Table 3 shows these comparisons in greater detail. As some annually appropriated resources were provided for FEMA from outside Title III in FY2018, a separate line is included for FEMA showing a total for what is provided solely within Title III, then the non-Title III appropriation, followed by the total annual appropriation for FEMA. Title IV, Research and Development, Training, and Services, the second smallest of the component-specific titles, contains appropriations for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), the Science and Technology Directorate (S&T), and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO). In FY2018, these components received $1.57 billion in net discretionary funding, as part of a projected total budget of $5.92 billion. This included $10 million in supplemental appropriations for FLETC. The Trump Administration requested $1.53 billion in FY2019 net discretionary funding for components included in this title, as part of a total budget for these components of $6.11 billion for FY2018. The funding request was $36 million (2.3%) less than the amount provided for FY2018, setting aside supplemental appropriations, although the overall budget request was $201 million (3.3%) higher than the annual budget projected for FY2018 (again, setting aside supplemental funding). This is due to changes in anticipated fee collections for USCIS and reorganization of most of the Office of Health Affairs and DNDO into the new CWMD component reflected in the request. Senate Appropriations Committee-reported S. 3109 included $1.53 billion in net discretionary funding for components included in this title, as part of a projected total budget of $6.23 billion. This was $115 million (7.5%) more than requested, and $79 million (5.0%) less than the amount provided for FY2018, not including supplemental funding. The total budgetary resources projected under S. 3109 would have been $115 million (1.9%) more than the Administration's request, and $316 million (5.3%) more than projected for FY2018, setting aside supplemental funding. House Appropriations Committee-reported H.R. 6776 included $1.64 billion in net discretionary funding for components included in this title, as part of a projected total budget of $6.21 billion. This was $97 million (6.3%) more than requested, and $60 million (3.9%) more than the amount provided for FY2018, not including supplemental funding. The total budgetary resources projected under H.R. 6776 would have been $97 million (1.6%) more than the Administration's request, and $297 million (5.0%) more than projected for FY2018, setting aside supplemental funding. P.L. 116-6 included $1.62 billion in FY2019 net discretionary funding for the components funded in this title. Enacted FY2019 appropriations were $199 million (3.3%) more than was requested by the Administration, and $163 million (10.4%) more than was provided in FY2018, setting aside FY2018 supplemental funding. Total budgetary resources projected for FY2019 are $199 million (3.3%) more than were requested by the Administration, and $400 million (6.8%) more than was projected for FY2018, setting aside FY2018 supplemental funding. Table 4 shows these comparisons in greater detail. As noted above, the fifth title of the FY2019 DHS appropriations act contains general provisions, the impact of which may reach across the entire department, affect multiple components, or focus on a single activity. Rescissions of prior-year appropriations—cancellations of budget authority that reduce the net funding level in the bill—are found in this title. For FY2018, Division F of P.L. 115-141 included $489 million in rescissions. For FY2019, the Administration proposed rescinding $300 million in prior-year funding from the DRF. S. 3109 included $137 million in rescissions from other appropriations, but specifically directed the $300 million the Administration had proposed rescinding from the DRF to other activities within DHS. H.R. 6776 did not include any rescissions, although an amendment from Representative Palazzo was passed in full committee markup on a voice vote redirecting unobligated balances from the Science and Technology Directorate to the Coast Guard. Division A of P.L. 116-6 included $303 million in rescissions, and a provision directing that $300 million of DRF unobligated balances be used to offset new DRF appropriations. In FY2018, funding was also included in Title V for the Financial Systems Modernization initiative and a grant program for Presidential Residence Protection costs, which are reflected in the tables for Title I and Title III, respectively, as those titles fund the components that manage these resources. For FY2019, Title V of S. 3109 only funded the Financial Systems Modernization initiative, and Title V of H.R. 6776 only funded Presidential Residence Protection costs. Title V of P.L. 116-6 , Division A, included funding for both the Financial Systems Modernization initiative and Presidential Residence Protection costs. The detail table in the back of H.Rept. 115-948 also notes the discretionary cost of several policy changes in H.R. 6776 . Four amendments adopted in House Appropriations Committee markup resulted in a net $13 million increase in the score of the bill, which is reflected in the detail table, but not in the tables of this report. No such costs are reflected in the detail table of H.Rept. 116-9 . For additional perspectives on FY2019 DHS appropriations, see the following: CRS Report R44604, Trends in the Timing and Size of DHS Appropriations: In Brief ; CRS Report R44052, DHS Budget v. DHS Appropriations: Fact Sheet ; and CRS Report R45262, Comparing DHS Component Funding, FY2019: In Brief . Congressional clients also may wish to consult CRS's experts directly. The following table lists CRS analysts and specialists who have expertise in policy areas linked to DHS appropriations. Budget Authority, Obligations, and Outlays Federal government spending involves a multistep process that begins with the enactment of budget authority by Congress. Federal agencies then obligate funds from enacted budget authority to pay for their activities. Finally, payments are made to liquidate those obligations; the actual payment amounts are reflected in the budget as outlays. Budget authority is established through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation and determines the amounts that are available for federal agencies to spend. The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal agencies from obligating more funds than the budget authority enacted by Congress. Budget authority also may be indefinite in amount, as when Congress enacts language providing ""such sums as may be necessary"" to complete a project or purpose. Budget authority may be available on a one-year, multiyear, or no-year basis. One-year budget authority is available for obligation only during a specific fiscal year; any unobligated funds at the end of that year are no longer available for spending. Multiyear budget authority specifies a range of time during which funds may be obligated for spending, and no-year budget authority is available for obligation for an indefinite period of time. Obligations are incurred when federal agencies employ personnel, enter into contracts, receive services, and engage in similar transactions in a given fiscal year—which create a legal requirement for the government to pay. Outlays are the funds that are actually spent during the fiscal year. Because multiyear and no-year budget authorities may be obligated over a number of years, outlays do not always match the budget authority enacted in a given year. Additionally, budget authority may be obligated in one fiscal year but spent in a future fiscal year, especially with certain contracts. In sum, budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorizes payments, or outlays, to be made from the Treasury. Discretionary funded agencies and programs, and appropriated entitlement programs, are funded each year in appropriations acts. Discretionary and Mandatory Spending Gross budget authority , or the total funds available for spending by a federal agency, may be composed of discretionary and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is not mandated by existing law and is thus appropriated yearly by Congress through appropriations acts. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 defines discretionary appropriations as budget authority provided in annual appropriations acts and the outlays derived from that authority, but it excludes appropriations for entitlements. Mandatory spending , also known as direct spending , consists of budget authority and resulting outlays provided in laws other than appropriations acts and is typically not appropriated each year. Some mandatory entitlement programs, however, must be appropriated each year and are included in appropriations acts. Within DHS, Coast Guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending. Offsetting Collections Offsetting funds are collected by the federal government, either from government accounts or the public, as part of a business-type transaction such as collection of a fee. These funds are not considered federal revenue. Instead, they are counted as negative outlays. DHS net discretionary budget authority , or the total funds appropriated by Congress each year, is composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset discretionary spending. Some collections offset a portion of an agency's discretionary budget authority. Other collections offset an agency's mandatory spending. These mandatory spending elements are typically entitlement programs under which individuals, businesses, or units of government that meet the requirements or qualifications established by law are entitled to receive certain payments if they establish eligibility. The DHS budget features two mandatory entitlement programs: the Secret Service and the Coast Guard retired pay accounts (pensions). Some entitlements are funded by permanent appropriations, and others are funded by annual appropriations. Secret Service retirement pay is a permanent appropriation and, as such, is not annually appropriated. In contrast, Coast Guard retirement pay is annually appropriated. In addition to these entitlements, the DHS budget contains offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds. These funds are not appropriated by Congress. They are available for obligation and included in the President's budget to calculate the gross budget authority. 302(a) and 302(b) Allocations In general practice, the maximum budget authority for annual appropriations (including DHS) is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process. In the first stage, Congress sets overall spending totals in the annual concurrent resolution on the budget. Subsequently, these totals are allocated among the appropriations committees, usually through the statement of managers for the conference report on the budget resolution. These amounts are known as the 302(a) allocations . They include discretionary totals available to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations for enactment in annual appropriations bills through the subcommittees responsible for the development of the bills. In the second stage of the process, the appropriations committees allocate the 302(a) discretionary funds among their subcommittees for each of the appropriations bills. These amounts are known as the 302(b) allocations . These allocations must add up to no more than the 302(a) discretionary allocation and form the basis for enforcing budget discipline, since any bill reported with a total above the ceiling is subject to a point of order. The 302(b) allocations may be adjusted during the year by the respective appropriations committee issuing a report delineating the revised suballocations as the various appropriations bills progress toward final enactment. No subcommittee allocations are developed for conference reports or enacted appropriations bills. Table A-1 shows comparable figures for the 302(b) allocation for FY2018, based on the adjusted net discretionary budget authority included in Division F of P.L. 115-141 , the President's request for FY2019, and the House and Senate subcommittee allocations for the Homeland Security appropriations bills for FY2019. The Budget Control Act, Discretionary Spending Caps, and Adjustments The Budget Control Act established enforceable discretionary limits, or caps, for defense and nondefense spending for each fiscal year from FY2012 through FY2021. Subsequent legislation, including the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, amended those caps. Most of the budget for DHS is considered nondefense spending. In addition, the Budget Control Act allows for adjustments that would raise the statutory caps to cover funding for overseas contingency operations/Global War on Terror, emergency spending, and, to a limited extent, disaster relief and appropriations for continuing disability reviews and control of health care fraud and abuse. Three of the four justifications outlined in the Budget Control Act for adjusting the caps on discretionary budget authority have played a role in DHS's appropriations process. Two of these—emergency spending and overseas contingency operations/Global War on Terror—are not limited. The third justification—disaster relief—is limited. Under the Budget Control Act, the allowable adjustment for disaster relief was determined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), using the following formula until FY2019: Limit on disaster relief cap adjustment for the fiscal year = Rolling average of the disaster relief spending over the last ten fiscal years (throwing out the high and low years) + the unused amount of the potential adjustment for disaster relief from the previous fiscal year. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 amended the above formula, increasing the allowable size of the adjustment by adding 5% of the amount of emergency-designated funding for major disasters under the Stafford Act, calculated by OMB as $6.296 billion. The act also extended the availability of unused adjustment capacity. In August 2018, OMB released a sequestration update report for FY2019 that provided a preview estimate of the allowable adjustment for FY2019 of $14.965 billion —the second-largest allowable adjustment for disaster relief in the history of the mechanism. $12 billion of that adjustment was exercised in P.L. 116-6 , Division A, in appropriations for the Disaster Relief Fund. No other annual appropriations used the disaster relief adjustment for FY2019. \n\n","['This report provides an overview and analysis of FY2019 appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The primary focus of this report is on congressional direction and funding provided to DHS through the appropriations process. It includes an Appendix with definitions of key budget terms used throughout the suite of Congressional Research Service reports on homeland security appropriations. It also directs the reader to other reports providing context for specific component appropriations. As part of an overall DHS budget that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimated to be $74.88 billion, the Trump Administration requested $47.43 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority through the appropriations process for DHS for FY2018. The request amounted to a $0.29 billion (0.6%) decrease from the $47.72 billion in annual appropriations enacted for FY2018 through the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141, Division F). The Administration also requested discretionary funding for DHS components that does not count against discretionary spending limits and is not reflected in the adjusted net discretionary budget authority total. The Administration requested an additional $6.65 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in disaster relief funding, as defined by the Budget Control Act (P.L. 112-25; BCA), and in the budget request for the Department of Defense (DOD), $165 million in Overseas Contingency Operations designated funding (OCO) from the Operations and Maintenance budget of the U.S. Navy. On June 21, 2018, the Senate Committee on Appropriations reported out S. 3109, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019, accompanied by S.Rept. 115-283. Committee-reported S. 3109 included $48.33 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for FY2019. This was $901 million (1.9%) above the level requested by the Administration, and $611 million (1.3%) above the enacted level for FY2018. The Senate committee-reported bill included the Administration-requested levels for disaster relief funding, and included the OCO funding in an appropriation to the Coast Guard, rather than as a transfer from the U.S. Navy. On July 26, 2018, the House Appropriations Committee marked up H.R. 6776, its version of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019. H.Rept. 115-948 was filed September 12, 2018. Committee-reported H.R. 6776 included $51.44 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority. The House committee-reported bill included the Administration-requested levels for disaster relief funding, but unlike S. 3109, did not include the OCO funding for the Coast Guard. As some of the annual appropriations for FY2019 remained unfinished, a consolidated appropriations bill that included a continuing resolution was passed by Congress and signed into law on September 28, 2018. The resolution, which covered DHS along with several other departments and agencies, continued funding at a rate of operations equal to FY2018 with some exceptions. This continuing resolution was extended through December 21, 2018, after which point annual appropriations lapsed.

"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nThe last several years have seen renewed debate over the role that race plays in higher education—a debate over ""affirmative action."" A high-profile lawsuit challenging Harvard University's consideration of race in admitting its incoming classes, and the recent withdrawal of Obama Administration-era guidance addressing similar race-conscious policies, have focused the debate on ""affirmative action"" in perhaps its more familiar sense: the voluntary consideration of student applicants' race as a way of increasing the participation of racial minorities in higher education. Meanwhile, a recent lawsuit involving Maryland's university system has brought renewed attention to ""affirmative action"" in its other, original sense: the mandatory use of race by public higher education systems to eliminate the remnants of state-imposed racial segregation. This report addresses ""affirmative action"" in each of these two senses and discusses how the federal courts have analyzed them under the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of ""equal protection."" The report first considers ""affirmative action"" in its original sense: the mandatory race-conscious measures that the federal courts have imposed on de jure segregated public university systems. The Supreme Court has made clear that a state that had a segregated system of education must eliminate all ""vestiges"" of that system, including through expressly race-conscious remedies. In its consequential 1992 decision United States v. Fordice , the Court charted a three-step inquiry for assessing whether a state has fulfilled that constitutional obligation, examining whether a current policy is traceable to the de jure segregated system, has continued discriminatory effect, and can be modified or practicably eliminated consistent with sound educational policy. Outside this de jure context, ""affirmative action"" has come to refer to a different category of race-conscious policies. These involve what the Court once called the ""benign"" use of racial classifications —voluntary measures designed not directly to remedy past governmental discrimination, but to increase the representation of racial minorities previously excluded from various societal institutions. And in the context of higher education the Court has addressed one type of policy in particular: the use of race as a factor in admissions decisions, a practice now observed by many public and private colleges and universities. As this report explains, the federal courts have come to subject these voluntary ""affirmative action"" policies to a particularly searching form of review, known today as strict scrutiny. And they have so far upheld those policies under a single theory: that the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body uniquely justify some consideration of race when deciding how to assemble an incoming class. To rely on that diversity rationale, however, the Court now requires universities to articulate in concrete and precise terms what their diversity-related goals are, and why they have chosen those goals in particular. And even once those goals are established, a university must still show that its admissions policy achieves its diversity-related goals as precisely as possible, while ultimately ""treat[ing] each applicant as an individual."" Because both lines of cases discussed here have their roots in the Equal Protection Clause, this report focuses primarily on public universities, all of which are directly subject to constitutional requirements. But those same requirements apply equally to private colleges and universities that receive federal funds pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI or the Act), which similarly prohibits recipients of federal dollars from discriminating on the basis of race. This report concludes by discussing the role that Title VI plays in ensuring equal protection in higher education, both public and private, including several avenues for congressional action under the Act. Though government-sanctioned racial segregation in public education is commonly associated with primary and secondary schools, numerous states had also mandated or permitted racial segregation in institutions of higher education, including through the latter part of the 20 th century, categorically excluding black students solely because of their race. Though the Supreme Court held decades ago that state-sanctioned racial segregation in higher education violates the Equal Protection Clause, such intentional segregation, or practices arising from formerly de jure segregated university systems and their discriminatory effects, may still persist. Addressing such circumstances, the Supreme Court has held the Equal Protection Clause to require states to eliminate all vestiges of their formerly de jure segregated public university systems that continue to have discriminatory effect. As the Court concluded in United States v. Fordice , state actors ""shall be adjudged in violation of the Constitution and Title VI [of the Civil Rights Act]"" to the extent they have failed to satisfy this affirmative duty to dismantle a de jure segregated public university system. A state actor therefore remains in violation of the Equal Protection Clause today if it maintains a policy or practice ""traceable"" to a formerly de jure segregated public university system that continues to foster racial segregation. Where such a violation is shown, race-conscious measures are not only constitutionally permissible, but may be constitutionally required to remedy and eliminate such unconstitutional remnants. As in the K-12 context, a number of states maintained racially segregated public university systems and denied black students admission to post-secondary schools—including colleges, law schools, and doctoral programs —on the basis that these institutions educated white students only. Prior to 1954—the year of the Supreme Court's landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision ( Brown I ) —the Court had interpreted the Equal Protection Clause to permit state-sanctioned racially segregated public educational systems, provided that the separate schools for black students were substantially equal to those reserved for white students. For example, in its 1950 decision Sweatt v. Painter , the Court addressed an equal protection claim raised by a black student challenging the University of Texas Law School's denial of his admission based on his race, pursuant to its white-only admissions policy. At the time of the plaintiff's application in 1946, the state did not have a law school that admitted black students. Denying the plaintiff's requested relief for admission, the state trial court instead granted additional time to Texas to create a law school for black students; the state thereafter created a law school at the Texas State University for Negroes. The Supreme Court, however, held that the law school—which, among other features, lacked accreditation —did not offer an education ""substantially equal"" to that which the plaintiff would receive at the University of Texas Law School. On that basis—the absence of a separate but equivalent legal education—the Court held that the Equal Protection Clause required the plaintiff's admission to the University of Texas Law School. A decisive turn in the Court's interpretation and application of the Equal Protection Clause, however, came by way of its 1954 decision in Brown I . There, the Court held for the first time that race-based segregation ""in the field of public education"" violates the Equal Protection Clause. The Court concluded that race-based segregation in public schools deprives minority students of equal educational opportunities, and observed that segregation commonly denotes inferiority of the minority group. Segregated educational facilities, the Court concluded, are ""inherently unequal."" The Court's holding in Brown I applies with equal force to public higher education—that is, to public colleges and universities —as does the Court's subsequent 1955 decision in the same case ("" Brown II ""), in which the Court addressed how school authorities and federal courts were to implement the mandate of Brown I . Indeed, one of the Court's earliest applications of Brown I and Brown II was in the higher education context. In that case, State of Fla. Ex. Rel. Hawkins v. Board of Control , the Supreme Court vacated a Florida supreme court decision that declined to order the state's white-only law school to admit a black student. Relying on language in Brown II that courts could consider practical obstacles to a school's transition to desegregation, the Florida court refused to order the plaintiff's admission. The Supreme Court vacated the state court's decision, concluding that in the case of admitting a black student ""to a graduate professional school, there [wa]s no reason for delay"" and that he was ""entitled to prompt admission under the rules and regulations applicable to other qualified candidates."" Following Brown I and Brown II , the Court's equal protection jurisprudence in the public education context expanded significantly to address questions regarding the scope and sufficiency of state actions to ""dismantle"" racially segregated systems in public school districts across the country, and various challenges to district court-ordered remedies. As the Court revisited these legal standards over time, it continued to describe the affirmative duty of formerly segregated public school entities as the duty to ""take all steps necessary to eliminate the vestiges of the unconstitutional de jure system"" to the extent practicable. Turning to the context of higher education, the Court addressed, in its 1992 decision United States v. Fordice , how these equal protection principles and legal standards apply to a state's affirmative duty to dismantle a formerly de jure segregated public university system. Though it had ""many occasions to evaluate whether a public school district has met its affirmative obligation to dismantle its prior de jure segregated system in elementary and secondary schools,"" the Court explained, Fordice presented the issue of ""what standards to apply"" in determining whether the state has met this obligation in the university context. At issue before the Court was Mississippi's prior de jure public university system. The Court observed that since establishing the University of Mississippi as an institution of ""higher education exclusively of white persons"" in 1848, Mississippi had created four more exclusively white institutions and three exclusively black institutions through 1950. Thereafter, it continued to maintain its racially segregated public university system, and admitted its first black student to the University of Mississippi in 1962 ""only by court order."" For the ""next 12 years,"" the state's segregated university system ""remained largely intact."" Around 1987, when the case went to trial, over 99 percent of the state's white students attended the five universities that had been formerly white-only, while the three formerly black-only institutions had student bodies between 92 percent to 99 percent black. Citing its precedent addressing de jure segregation in the K-12 context, the Court stated that ""[o]ur decisions establish that a [s]tate does not satisfy its constitutional obligations until it eradicates policies and practices traceable to its prior de jure dual system that continue to foster segregation."" Perhaps critically, in the context of remedying a formerly de jure segregated system, a state's ""adoption and implementation of race-neutral policies alone "" is not sufficient to demonstrate that it has ""completely abandoned its prior dual system."" Aside from segregative admissions policies, the Court explained, a state's other policies may shape and determine student choice and attendance, and continue to foster segregation. Instead, to determine whether a state has satisfied its affirmative duty to dismantle its de jure public university system, the Court set out a three-step analysis. First , the analysis examines whether the challenged policy or practice maintained by the state is ""traceable to its prior [ de jure ] system."" By way of example, the Court identified four policies that, in its view, were ""readily apparent"" vestiges of de jure segregation: admissions standards based on a test-score range originally adopted for discriminatory reasons; unnecessary program duplication throughout the university system (e.g., multiple institutions offering the same ""nonbasic"" courses); the state's academic mission assignments to its higher education institutions (e.g., assigning the broadest academic missions to only formerly white-only institutions and the narrowest academic mission to a formerly black-only institution); and the continued operation of all public universities established in the de jure segregated system. With respect to traceability, the Court's analysis reflects that where a current policy functions based on distinctions or a framework created in a formerly de jure system, traceability can be shown. For example, when concluding that the state's designation of academic missions to its universities was traceable to de jure segregation, the Court cited evidence that the state's current method of assigning its universities into three academic missions levels largely mirrored a three-tiered grouping of its universities in the de jure system. In addition and more generally, an interim change or new, nondiscriminatory justification for a current policy does not necessarily sever its traceability to a de jure system. Where the traceability of a policy or policies is shown, a party need not show discriminatory intent with respect to those challenged policies. Where traceability is not shown—that is, where the policies ""do not have such historical antecedents"" to de jure segregation—an equal protection challenge would then require ""a showing of discriminatory purpose."" In those instances, the Court explained, ""the question becomes whether the fact of racial separation establishes a new violation of the Fourteenth Amendment under traditional principles."" Second , once traceability is shown, the analysis turns to whether those traceable policies have continued discriminatory or ""segregative"" effects in student choice, enrollment, or other facets of the university system. At this stage, the Court noted that a court should not consider ""this issue in isolation,"" but rather examine the ""combined effects"" of all the challenged policies together ""in evaluating whether the State ha[s] met its duty to dismantle its prior de jure segregated system."" In light of this instruction, it appears the focus of the second step of the test is not on establishing causation between specific racial disparities and specific policies—by this stage, a court has already found traceability—but rather to evaluate whether a state has sufficiently dismantled its formerly de jure system. Consistent with the state's burden of proving it has dismantled its de jure segregated system, the state must show the absence of segregative effects; plaintiffs are not required to establish this second element. Third , because traceable policies that have discriminatory effects ""run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause,"" such policies must accordingly ""be reformed to the extent practicable and consistent with sound educational practices."" Thus, at the third step, a court assesses whether traceable policies can be ""practicably eliminated"" ""consistent with sound educational practices,"" with the burden on the state to show that the challenged policies are ""not susceptible to elimination without eroding sound educational policy."" Because the Court remanded the case to the lower court to address practicable elimination, its analysis in Fordice on this point is limited. The Court suggested, however, that if a current policy lacks sound educational justification, it reasonably follows that it can be practicably eliminated in part or in whole. In addition, the Court observed that in some cases, a merger or closure of institutions could be constitutionally required to eliminate vestiges, should other methods fail to eliminate their discriminatory effects. Finally, the Court repeatedly stated that so long as vestiges remain, which have discriminatory effects, the state remains in violation of the Equal Protection Clause unless it can show it cannot practicably eliminate those policies or practices. In addition, Justice O'Connor, in a separate concurring opinion in Fordice , emphasized the ""narrow"" circumstances under which a state could maintain a traceable policy or practice with segregative effects. In her view, courts may ""infer lack of good faith"" on the part of the state if it could accomplish educational objectives through less segregative means, and the state has a ""'heavy burden'"" to explain its preference for retaining the challenged practice. Moreover, even if the state shows that retaining certain traceable policies or practices is ""essential to accomplish its legitimate goals,"" Justice O'Connor asserted that the state must still prove it has ""counteracted and minimized the segregative impact of such policies to the extent possible."" The Court in Fordice observed that the closure or merger of certain institutions may be constitutionally required, consistent with its holding that any vestige of a de jure segregated system that continues to have discriminatory effect must be eliminated to the extent practicable and consistent with sound educational policy. Yet that invited a new—and more difficult—set of questions: which institutions would be most subject to closure or merger, and under what circumstances would such action be required? Significantly, the Court did not categorically identify which institutions would be most subject to such remedial action —a state's flagship, formerly white-only institutions from which a de jure system originated, for example, or formerly black-only institutions created to preserve white-only admission at other institutions. Instead, the Court concluded that it was unable to determine—on the record presented in Fordice —whether closures or mergers were required in that case and directed the lower court on remand to ""carefully explore"" several considerations. This instruction to the lower court, while not part of the holding in Fordice , suggests that several factors are relevant for determining whether merger or closure is constitutionally required. In addition, the Court observed that maintaining all eight higher education institutions in Mississippi was ""wasteful and irrational,"" particularly in light of the close geographic proximity between some of the universities. This observation suggests that close proximity between institutions offering similar programs could be a relevant factor in assessing remedial closure or merger as well. Regarding the fate of a state's historically black institutions, Justice Thomas, in a concurring opinion, did not read Fordice to ""forbid[]"" those institutions' continued operation or ""foreclose the possibility that there exists 'sound educational justification' for maintaining historically black colleges as such ."" Justice Thomas emphasized that ""[d]espite the shameful history of state-enforced segregation,"" historically black colleges and universities were and remain institutions critical to the academic flourishing and leadership development of many students, and observed that ""[i]t would be ironic, to say the least, if the institutions that sustained blacks during segregation were themselves destroyed in an effort to combat its vestiges."" In his view, though a state is not constitutionally required to maintain its historically black institutions as such, their continued operation is constitutionally permissible, so long as admission is open to all students ""on a race-neutral basis, but with established traditions and programs that might disproportionately appeal to one race or another."" Following Fordice , plaintiffs, including the United States in Title VI enforcement actions, have brought suit challenging practices allegedly traceable to a state's de jure segregated university system. Challenged practices have included unnecessary program duplication, which the Court identified in Fordice as one of the ""readily apparent"" remnants of de jure segregation, as well as others such as scholarship policies, funding practices, and the use of curricula at formerly white-only institutions with little representation of black history and culture. More recently, in 2018, a legal challenge against the State of Maryland alleged that practices relating to capital and operational funding, unnecessary program duplication, and the limited institutional missions of the state's formerly black-only institutions are traceable to the state's formerly de jure segregated higher education system. To date, however, only a few federal appellate courts have had occasion to analyze Fordice -based claims, and the Supreme Court has not, since its 1992 decision, addressed claims challenging higher education policies or practices as unconstitutional vestiges of de jure segregation. Though development of the Fordice standard in federal case law is limited, the few appellate decisions applying Fordice provide at least some analytical examples and reflect discernible differences in approach, particularly with respect to the evidence sufficient to satisfy the third element of the Fordice standard—that elimination of a practice is not possible, despite being traceable and having continued discriminatory effect. As discussed above, the Supreme Court in Fordice identified ""unnecessary program duplication"" as a practice traceable to the prior de jure segregated system of higher education at issue in that case, stating that ""it can hardly be denied"" that such duplication was a requisite feature of the prior dual system because ""the whole notion of 'separate but equal' required duplicative programs in two sets of schools."" Drawing upon that rationale, courts that have addressed unnecessary program duplication have generally had little difficulty tracing duplicative courses and degree programs to prior de jure segregation. On the matter of if and how program duplication might be eliminated, however, there is lesser consensus. Generally, federal courts have considered several methods for eliminating program duplication, such as transferring existing programs from one institution to another, eliminating certain programs altogether, creating cooperative programs, and—perhaps most drastically—merging institutions. Plaintiffs have also raised equal protection challenges to state funding practices that allocate all or most of their federal and state land grants to institutions that were formerly white-only in a de jure system while dedicating significantly less or no funds to formerly black-only institutions. More specifically, these cases have concerned a state's allocation of federal land grants provided annually to support research on agricultural issues and the dissemination or ""extension"" of that research. At issue in Knight v. Alabama , for example, was the State of Alabama's allocation of federal funds between its two land grant universities, Auburn University, formerly white-only in the de jure system, and Alabama A&M University (A&M), formerly established as black-only. The state allocated to Auburn the entirety of Alabama's approximately $4 million in federal aid for agricultural research, and allocated an additional $14 million to Auburn in state funds. Meanwhile, the state had ""for years"" allocated no federal aid to A&M and given state funds for agricultural research in amounts that ""today still totals less than $200,000 each year."" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that the state's current funding allocation was traceable to de jure segregation and instructed the lower court on remand to make determinations with respect to the second and third parts of the Fordice test. On the issue of practicable elimination, the Eleventh Circuit observed that reduced efficiency would not necessarily render a proposed modification impracticable or educationally unsound. By contrast, the Fifth Circuit affirmed a district court's ruling that permitted a state to retain its traceable funding practices. There, despite finding traceability and discriminatory effects, the district court had concluded, based on inefficiencies related to running more than one agricultural research program, that it was not practicable for the state to eliminate its exclusive funding allocation to its formerly white-only land grant institution. The Supreme Court has not revisited its analysis in Fordice , leaving open questions about the permissible applications of its three-part legal standard to an array of fact patterns and legal theories. Similarly, as discussed above, few courts of appeals have addressed claims under Fordice , limiting the development and interpretation of Fordice in federal case law. One such unresolved question is under what circumstances, if any, traceability can be established under Fordice when a state makes changes to an originally discriminatory policy such that the current policy functions differently, but there is still some evidence of traceability between the two, or perpetuation of similar segregative effects under the changed policy as under the original policy. In addition, the Supreme Court and circuit courts have not yet expressly addressed how far a district court may go in remedying an unconstitutional vestige or remnant of a prior de jure public university system. In the K-12 context, the Supreme Court has upheld district court orders that set certain faculty and student ratios at schools in noncompliant school districts, to desegregate them pursuant to Brown and its progeny . It remains unclear, however, whether the district courts enjoy similar authority under Fordice to order similarly extensive remedies. Indeed, the few cases alleging Fordice -type claims that did reach the federal appellate courts ultimately resolved in settlements, thus leaving little judicial guidance on the scope of a court's authority to mandate specific remedies if a state fails to dismantle its formerly de jure segregated public university system. With respect to these unresolved questions, the Supreme Court's express reliance in Fordice on precedent addressing de jure segregation in the primary and secondary school context suggests that at least some of this same precedent should inform future analyses, with adaptation to the higher education context. A finding of a state entity's intent to segregate students by race in the higher education context is critical to showing a violation of the Equal Protection Clause, and has significant legal consequences. In such cases of de jure —that is, intentional, state-imposed —segregation, the state has an affirmative duty under the Equal Protection Clause to eliminate all vestiges of its de jure system by dismantling the infrastructure and other mechanisms that produced the discriminatory segregation. According to the Supreme Court's 1992 Fordice decision, this duty commands more than just the repeal of state laws sanctioning racial segregation in higher education. The state must also uproot or reform any policy or practice ""traceable"" to its formerly de jure system that continues to have discriminatory effect. In Fordice , the state's intent to racially segregate its higher education system was plain: with the founding of the University of Mississippi in 1848, Mississippi explicitly set out to create a public university ""dedicated to the higher education exclusively of white persons,"" and racially segregated its public university system over the next 100 years through the creation of other ""exclusively white institutions"" and ""solely black institutions."" Nor was Mississippi's system unique in this regard. ""[D]ual system[s]"" of public higher education—one for black students, another for white—were codified in other state and local laws throughout the country. Thus far, federal courts that have addressed de jure segregation in higher education have done so in the context of such codified segregation, as in Fordice . The absence of a codified dual system of higher education, however, may not mean that a university system was not or is not intentionally segregated. As reflected in the Supreme Court decision Keyes v. School District No. 1, Denver, Colorado , even when state authorities have not segregated their public schools by statute, they may still have engaged in unconstitutional racial segregation. Thus, in the K-12 context, federal courts have found de jure segregation based on evidence reflecting a state actor's impermissible segregative intent. This line of cases would appear to apply in the context of higher education as well. As the Court noted in Fordice , where a plaintiff is unable to show that a policy or practice is a vestige of prior de jure segregation, she may nonetheless prove a ""new"" constitutional violation with evidence of a present-day intent to racially segregate students ""under traditional principles"" governing discriminatory intent. This would be consistent with the Court's application of Brown and its progeny broadly across ""the field of public education,"" including higher education, as reflected in Fordice . Because the Supreme Court has yet to address segregative intent in higher education, it is unclear what intent evidence would be sufficient to establish a de jure segregated public university or institution, apart from a law codifying such segregation. As a general matter, though, a court's determination of discriminatory intent is a fact-intensive, ""sensitive inquiry."" And the Supreme Court has observed that this is even more so in cases alleging de jure segregation in public education. Where the evidence indicates, for example, that a state actor undertook a policy or practice knowing that doing so would have the ""foreseeable"" effect of segregating students by race, that evidence may support an inference of de jure segregation. In addition, at least in the K-12 context, a finding of a state entity's segregative intent in one part of a school system creates a rebuttable presumption that segregation found in other parts of the same system was also intentional. De jure segregation proved by such nonstatutory evidence generally triggers the same affirmative obligation on the state to eliminate the vestiges of its state-imposed segregation, as when de jure segregation is shown through state or local laws. Though segregative intent analyses at the K-12 level may be instructive, the guidance these decisions provide may be limited by the nature of the evidence at issue in those particular cases: the method of student assignment to elementary or secondary schools, for example, or the drawing of attendance zones to create racially segregated schools. It appears unlikely that such evidence would be at issue or directly applicable in cases alleging segregative intent at the collegiate or graduate level. Nonetheless, these decisions generally suggest that categorical distinctions—between evidence indicative of de jure segregation and evidence of existing segregation insufficiently linked to state intent—are difficult to draw. Indeed, given the difficulties that can arise in a court's analysis of ""segregative intent,"" over the years a number of Justices have called into question the rationale and basis for the distinction between de jure and so-called de facto segregation, though the majority of the Court has recognized and continues to recognize this distinction. Whatever the open questions may be regarding the evidence sufficient to show segregative intent, particularly in the higher education context, Fordice instructs that a plaintiff need not provide evidence of new discriminatory intent when alleging that a state has failed to eliminate vestiges of a prior de jure segregated system. And with respect to remedying intentional racial segregation, the Court has repeatedly held that a state not only may use a broad array of explicit race-conscious policies and practices to remedy its constitutional violation, but often must do so. By themselves, race-neutral measures simply may not be enough, the Court has explained, to provide equitable, make-whole relief for intentionally segregative acts. This affirmative obligation to consider race arises, however, only in the context of de jure segregation. Outside that de jure context, institutions of higher education subject to the Equal Protection Clause have no such duty to remedy racial segregation. Nor may they—or the federal courts, for that matter—use the same broad array of race-conscious measures available for remedying de jure segregation. De jure segregation, however, is not the only context in which race-conscious measures in higher education may be used. For over forty years colleges and universities have considered race as a way of increasing the racial diversity of their student bodies, independent from a legal basis relating to de jure segregation. Thus far, however, the Supreme Court has addressed only one type of discretionary race-conscious measure in the higher education context: admissions policies. And when evaluating these discretionary policies, the Court reviews them under a notably different analytical lens, looking to their precision in achieving certain concretely defined and ""compelling"" educational interests, as explained more fully below. ""Affirmative action"" in its original sense grew out of the states' affirmative obligation under the Equal Protection Clause to rid their public institutions of the lingering vestiges of de jure segregation. But ""affirmative action"" has also come to refer to race-conscious policies developed outside this de jure context. These are policies voluntarily adopted by institutions to help racial minorities overcome the effects of their earlier exclusion. And unlike the measures ordered by the courts to right the wrongs of de jure segregation, these policies are strictly voluntary, with their legality consequently turning on constitutional considerations unlike those involved in the de jure context. ""Affirmative action"" in this more familiar, voluntary sense has also been among the most contentious subjects in constitutional law. In the forty years since Regents of the University of California v. Bakke , when the Court first addressed those programs' constitutionality, the Justices have divided sharply over when or whether such programs can survive constitutional scrutiny. And a major point of disagreement among the Justices—lingering to this day —is how strictly to review those policies and what the government or other state entity must do to justify its use of ""benign"" racial classifications. In recent decisions, the Court has reviewed such classifications under a seemingly ""elastic"" regime of strict scrutiny, accepting those classifications only where they have been narrowly tailored to serve compelling government interests. The constitutional guarantee of equal protection broadly prohibits the government from employing ""arbitrary classification[s]."" And the use of racial classifications in particular has long been of special concern for the courts. Indeed, this ""heightened judicial solicitude"" for racial categorizing has roots nearly as old as the Fourteenth Amendment itself. As the Supreme Court explained in an early decision under the Amendment, the ""spirit and meaning"" of the Equal Protection Clause was ""that the law in the States shall be the same for the black as for the white; that all persons, whether colored or white, shall stand equal before the laws of the States, and, in regard to the colored race, ... that no discrimination shall be made against them by law because of their color."" In the decades since, the Court has only made clearer that it regards the government's use of racial classifications as ""inherently suspect"" and therefore subject to more demanding scrutiny than other classifications, which are typically reviewed only for basic rationality. There has been significant disagreement, however, over just how rigidly the courts should scrutinize a racial classification, especially when the point of the classification is to benefit racial minorities, as in the case of affirmative action. That issue came before the Court for the first time in Bakke , involving a challenge to an affirmative action admissions program begun at the then newly created medical school at the University of California at Davis (the Medical School). And the Court's fractured decision there prefigured the central disagreements that the Justices still face in reviewing so-called ""benign"" racial classifications. In the early 1970s, not long after the Medical School opened, it adopted a race-conscious admissions policy to increase its enrollment of certain ""disadvantaged"" students. Under that policy, the school each year would set aside 16 seats in its entering class of 100 specifically for members of this ""disadvantaged"" group, to be admitted by a ""special admissions"" committee. Although many white students sought admission under this ""special"" policy, the committee considered only students of specifically identified racial minorities. After Allan Bakke, a white male, twice sought—and was denied—admission to the school, he brought suit challenging the set-aside under the Equal Protection Clause as well as Title VI, which prohibits institutional recipients of federal funds—like the Medical School—from discriminating on the basis of race. Bakke's case eventually found its way to the Supreme Court and into the hands of a divided bench. The Justices found themselves particularly at odds over the case's threshold question—what level of scrutiny the Court should apply in reviewing Bakke's challenge. Justice Stevens, writing for a quartet of Justices, concluded that the program violated Title VI, sidestepping the constitutional question. Another four Justices would have reached the equal protection challenge, and in doing so would have required the Medical School to point to ""important governmental objectives"" that justified its admissions policy's use of ""remedial"" racial classifications, along with evidence that their use was ""substantially related to"" achieving those important objectives . Under that standard—a form of intermediate scrutiny —these Justices would have upheld the policy. Justice Powell, announcing the Court's judgment but writing for himself, insisted that all ""racial and ethnic distinctions"" drawn by the government must be regarded as ""inherently suspect,"" calling for ""the most exacting judicial examination."" What that meant in Bakke , according to Justice Powell, was that the Medical School would need to prove that its use of the ""special admissions"" carve-out was ""precisely tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest""—the standard of review now known simply as strict scrutiny . And because, in his view, the school could come forward with no such proof, Justice Powell concluded that its affirmative-action policy could not survive the Court's scrutiny, whether under the Fourteenth Amendment or the overlapping standards of Title VI. Because Bakke yielded no majority opinion, it could only hint at how the Court might treat other ""benign"" race-conscious policies that did not involve the sort of apparent quota invalidated in that case or cases outside the unique context of higher education. That uncertainty would last another decade, as the Court, in another series of splintered decisions, weighed constitutional challenges to differently structured affirmative action policies in other contexts, each time without resolving the appropriate standard of review. That uncertainty appeared to abate with the Court's 1989 decision in Richmond v. J.A. Croson , Co. There, for the first time, five Justices clearly signaled that they would apply strict scrutiny to affirmative action plans implemented at the state and local levels, including the program they invalidated in that case, involving the City of Richmond's set-aside of public work funds for minority-owned businesses. But the next year, in Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC , the Court, in another 5-4 ruling, suggested that it would review federal affirmative action plans differently. In the Court's view there, ""benign race-conscious measures mandated by Congress "" need only ""serve important governmental objectives"" and be ""substantially related to the achievement of those objectives""—satisfying an intermediate level of scrutiny. Just a few years later, however, in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peńa , the Supreme Court reversed course. There, in a federal contracting case, the Court drew a different lesson from its pre- Metro line of race-classification cases: in the view of the Adarand majority, ""any person, of whatever race, has the right to demand that any governmental actor subject to the Constitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to unequal treatment under the strictest judicial scrutiny."" That simple rule therefore precluded the divided regime upheld in Metro Broadcasting , subjecting the states' use of racial classifications to strict scrutiny, while relaxing the review of comparable classifications enacted by Congress. Instead, the Adarand Court held, ""[f]ederal racial classifications, like those of a State, must serve a compelling governmental interest, and must be narrowly tailored to further that interest."" And to the extent that Metro Broadcasting was ""inconsistent"" with that uniform rule, it was accordingly overruled. After Adarand strict scrutiny therefore became the test of any classification that subjected individuals to unequal treatment based on their race, no matter which state actor was doing the classifying. And the Court expressly extended that holding to the context of higher education. As the Court reaffirmed in Fisher v. University of Texas , ""because racial characteristics so seldom provide a relevant basis for disparate treatment,"" ""[r]ace may not be considered [by a university] unless [its] admissions process can withstand strict scrutiny."" It therefore appears that a classification that subjects individuals to unequal treatment because of their race, even if for a ""benign"" purpose, will have to satisfy strict scrutiny. In its canonical formulation, that test calls for measuring such classifications along the two dimensions Justice Powell identified in Bakke : (1) the classification must serve a compelling governmental interest and (2) the use of that classification must also be narrowly tailored to achieving that interest. The government has the burden of proving both, and neither is easy to do. Indeed, in the sixty years that separated the Court's now-repudiated decision in Korematsu v. United States from Grutter v. Bollinger , when the Court first upheld an affirmative action policy at a public university, the only other ""racial classifications upheld under strict scrutiny [have been] race-based remedies for prior racial discrimination by the government."" To many commentators ""strict scrutiny"" has thus come to seem rather more ""strict in theory, but fatal in fact"" —a point sometimes echoed by the Justices themselves. Strict scrutiny may typically be fatal in fact, but affirmative action policies in higher education have been a notable exception. Partly this has to do with the Equal Protection Clause itself, and the often crucial difference that a particular context makes in deciding cases under that ""broad provision[]."" And for several Justices the context of affirmative action, involving the arguably ""benign"" use of race, has seemed particularly distinctive. Yet, despite this contextual difference, the Court has made it clear that its scrutiny of race-conscious admission policies is still every bit as strict. Or, as Justice Kennedy put the point in the first Fisher case, even though ""[s]trict scrutiny must not be 'strict in theory, but fatal in fact,'"" it must also ""not be strict in theory but feeble in fact."" This seeming tension—between the strictness of the Court's scrutiny and its approval of race-conscious admissions policies—has led the Court to adjust its framework for scrutinizing similar policies over the years. And since Bakke that framework appears to have shifted in two significant respects, corresponding to each of the two prongs of strict scrutiny. First, the Court now requires public universities that adopt affirmative action admissions policies to explain in increasingly ""concrete and precise"" terms what diversity-related educational goals those policies serve and why the university has chosen to pursue them. Anything less, the Court has held, would fail to present an interest sufficiently compelling under strict scrutiny. Second, the Court also now expects universities to prove that their policies achieve those ""concrete and precise goals"" in an appropriately ""flexible"" way, as most clearly exemplified by the Harvard plan that Justice Powell singled out in Bakke . That model has yielded ""five hallmarks"" of an appropriately tailored affirmative action policy, criteria that have since guided lower courts in assessing other affirmative action plans. For a university's affirmative action policy to survive strict scrutiny, a university must first ""demonstrate with clarity that its 'purpose or interest is both constitutionally permissible and substantial."" The Court has recognized only a single interest that meets that standard: ""the attainment of a diverse student body."" What exactly that interest amounts to—and how, consequently, a university should ensure it has appropriately tailored its policy to achieve that interest—has been a point of uncertainty since Bakke . With its two decisions in Fisher v. University of Texas , however, the Court appears now to require a more ""concrete and precise"" articulation of the diversity-related educational goals a university hopes to achieve through its affirmative action admissions policy. In addition, the Court also now appears to expect a university to provide a reasoned and principled explanation of why the school believes it important to achieve those goals. The diversity rationale emerged with the Court's first encounter with a voluntary affirmative-action policy, in Bakke . There—in an opinion for the Court joined by no other Justice—Justice Powell explained what interests clearly would not count as compelling enough to satisfy strict scrutiny. Those included the Medical School's alleged interest in having ""some specified percentage"" of certain racial or ethnic groups in a student body and its interest in ""remedying ... the effects of societal discrimination,"" as well as the school's particular interest in ""the delivery of health-care services to communities currently underserved."" None of these interests, Justice Powell concluded, provided a reason substantial enough to justify turning to race-conscious measures. Nor has the Court said otherwise since. But Justice Powell was also clear about what interest he believed would satisfy strict scrutiny: ""student body diversity."" And just as importantly, he also explained why: colleges and universities, he suggested, had a uniquely academic interest in promoting an ""atmosphere of speculation, experiment, and creation""—an interest, more simply, in ""academic freedom."" That interest, Justice Powell observed, was not only ""essential to the quality of higher education,"" but had also long ""been viewed as a special concern of the First Amendment."" Thus the ""right to select those students who will contribute the most to the robust exchange of ideas"" not only allowed a university ""to achieve a goal that is of paramount importance in the fulfillment of its mission,"" it also represented a ""countervailing constitutional interest"" that, in Justice Powell's view, called for the Court's respect. In Bakke , Justice Powell set out the basic theory for why diversity could justify an affirmative action policy, at least ""in the context of a university's admissions program. But he gave few details about what that interest encompassed. As he saw it, that interest must have its limits: pursuing diversity would not allow a university to resort to racial quotas, for example, nor could the school disregard other ""constitutional limitations protecting individual rights."" But Justice Powell declined to indicate where those other limitations fell or how they circumscribed the goals a university could permissibly seek in the name of a diverse student body. And because the Bakke Court fractured as it did, with no one opinion commanding a majority of the Justices' votes, the lessons of that case have been hard to discern, especially after the Court appeared to decline a similar diversity rationale in later cases outside higher education. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the lower courts soon came to reflect this uncertain division of opinion in later cases involving affirmative action programs at other public universities. Some clarity over Bakke 's diversity theory came in 2003, with a pair of decisions reviewing affirmative action policies of the University of Michigan: Grutter v. Bollinger , challenging the university's law school admission program, and Gratz v. Bollinger , challenging the policy used by the university's undergraduate program. Grutter , especially, helped clarify what an interest in diversity involved, and how a university could rely on that interest to defend a race-conscious admissions policy. Under the admissions policy of the University of Michigan Law School ( the Law School) challenged in Grutter , applicants to incoming classes were admitted under a policy that weighed a composite of the applicant's LSAT score and undergraduate GPA along with several more individualized factors, including the applicant's race. The Law School set out to create classes with what it called a ""critical mass of underrepresented minority students,"" to ensure that those students felt ""encourage[d] ... to participate in the classroom and not feel isolated."" The school, however, never explicitly assigned a numerical target for any particular racial group, though it did track, on an ongoing basis, ""the racial composition of the developing class."" A rejected white applicant claimed the Law School's admission policy discriminated against her based on her race, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause and Title VI. And her challenge eventually reached the Supreme Court, alongside its companion case, Gratz , challenging the university's admissions policy for its undergraduate program. Given the uncertainties surrounding Bakke 's bottom line, the first major question in Grutter centered on the basic goal of the Law School's policy: Is achieving student diversity an interest compelling enough to justify a school's use of race at all in its admissions decisions? And for the first time the Supreme Court held that it was. Writing for a clear majority, Justice O'Connor adopted the view Justice Powell set out in Bakke : ""student body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify the use of race in university admissions."" More than that, the Court made clear that it was willing to defer to the Law School's understanding of that interest, and its goal of ""enroll[ing] a 'critical mass' of minority students.'"" As Justice O'Connor explained for the Court, by enrolling a ""critical mass"" of students, the Law School was trying to achieve the ""substantial"" ""educational benefits that diversity is designed to produce""—benefits such as ""promot[ing] cross-racial understanding,"" ""break[ing] down racial stereotypes,"" ""promot[ing] learning outcomes,"" and ""better prepar[ing students] as professionals."" Achieving a ""critical mass"" of underrepresented students, the Court agreed, was simply one way that the Law School could try to vindicate those diversity-related educational benefits. And because this interest was deemed compelling enough to satisfy strict scrutiny, the Court was therefore willing to treat the school's use of the ""critical mass"" target as a permissible proxy for achieving those benefits. Not all the Justices agreed, however, that the university's invocation of ""critical mass"" made the diversity interest more concrete or compelling. In dissent, Justice Kennedy sided with Chief Justice Rehnquist's view that ""the concept of critical mass [was] a delusion used by the Law School to mask its attempt to make race an automatic factor in most instances and to achieve numerical goals indistinguishable from quotas."" That ""delusion,"" according to Justice Kennedy, did not just make the school's appeal to ""critical mass"" ""inconsistent with [the] individual consideration"" of applicants. It also, in his view, turned the school's admissions policy into a veiled form of racial balancing. And all four dissenting Justices found that result incompatible with the Equal Protection Clause. Grutter appeared to settle the major question left open by the fractured decision in Bakke : whether achieving student diversity was a compelling enough interest for a public university to justify its consideration of race in its admissions policies. Grutter confirmed not only that the Court still viewed student diversity as a compelling interest, but also that a school could vindicate that interest by seeking to enroll a ""critical mass"" of underrepresented minorities in its incoming classes. The ruling also effectively swept aside contrary lower court decisions that struck down other state universities' affirmative action policies, including in Texas. In the wake of Grutter , the University of Texas (UT Austin) decided to revisit its applicant review process, eventually choosing to introduce race as one of the factors considered in its admissions policy. Under the revised policy, UT Austin would continue to admit all Texas high school students who graduated in the top ten percent of their class, and fill in the rest of its incoming undergraduate classes using an index score incorporating two assessments: (1) an ""Academic Index"" (AI) that weighed the applicant's SAT score and academic record; and (2) a ""Personal Achievement Index"" (PAI) that included a more holistic appraisal of the student's character and, following post- Grutter revisions, also factored in the applicant's race. Abigail Fisher, a white Texas student whose application to UT Austin was rejected under this process, challenged the AI-PAI system. That system, she argued, had discriminated against her as a white applicant by allegedly allowing race to figure in the decision to reject her application, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Her challenge eventually made its way to the Supreme Court as Fisher v. University of Texas , where the Supreme Court remanded the challenge to the lower court to review UT Austin's policy under strict scrutiny ( Fis her I ), and then upon appeal upheld the school's admission policy ( Fis her II ). In her suit, Fisher did not challenge Grutter 's basic holding—that the university had a compelling interest in student diversity, or even that the school could pursue that interest in diversity by enrolling a ""critical mass"" of underrepresented minorities. But when the Court finally took up her challenge on the merits in Fisher II , Justice Kennedy also took the occasion to revisit Grutter 's analysis, offering several ""controlling principles"" on behalf of the four-Justice majority that would guide its review of UT Austin's race-conscious admissions policy. In Fisher II , as in Fisher I , Justice Kennedy confirmed that Grutter 's bottom line remained good law: ""obtaining 'the educational benefits that flow from student body diversity,'"" he confirmed, was still an interest compelling enough to satisfy strict scrutiny. But perhaps mindful of his dissent in Grutter , Justice Kennedy also clarified that ""asserting an interest in the educational benefits of diversity writ large"" would not suffice. That, he explained, would make the ""university's goals"" too ""elusory or amorphous"" ""to permit judicial scrutiny of the policies adopted to reach them."" The Court thus cut two new benchmarks for reviewing a university's asserted interest in resorting to race as a factor in its admissions policy. First, the university had to articulate ""precise and concrete goals"" that its race-conscious policy served, goals ""sufficiently measurable"" under ""judicial scrutiny."" And, second, the university had to provide a ""'reasoned, principled explanation' for its decision to pursue those goals""—a sound academic rationale, in other words, for wanting to achieve whatever diversity-related goals it set for itself. In the majority's view, UT Austin's use of race in its admissions decisions measured up to both benchmarks. According to the Court, the first benchmark was straightforwardly met: the goals UT Austin articulated, Justice Kennedy pointed out, effectively ""mirror[ed] the 'compelling interest' th[e] Court ha[d] approved in its prior cases."" And under Grutter , the majority concluded, those benefits passed constitutional muster. Notably, however, achieving critical mass was not among those Justice Kennedy listed. Nor did Justice Kennedy return to the question he raised in Grutter : whether the ""critical mass"" concept even has a place among the ""concrete and precise goals"" that could survive strict scrutiny. But that question was also arguably beside the point in Fisher II . As Justice Kennedy emphasized for the Court, the goals that UT Austin articulated were clearly constitutionally adequate, having come nearly verbatim from the Court's case law. And the university's officials had all offered ""the same, consistent 'reasoned, principled explanation'"" for pursuing them—meeting the Court's second benchmark. That was apparently enough for the Court to conclude that a compelling interest justified the university's diluted use of race in its holistic review of applications. With Fisher I and II , the Court reiterated that the educational benefits that come with a racially diverse student body count among the few interests compelling enough to survive strict scrutiny. But Fisher I and II also narrowed that interest: seeking student body diversity had to involve objectives more specific than the simple desire for ""diversity writ large."" Rather, under the Fisher formulation, the university must articulate the ""concrete and precise goals"" it expects its affirmative action policy to accomplish, along with a ""reasoned, principled explanation"" of why it has chosen to pursue them. So long as a university does that, it will likely have a strong case, under Fisher I and II , that a compelling interest supports its use of a race-conscious admissions policy. That, however, is only the first of two tests that a policy has to pass under strict scrutiny. The second—probing whether the university has narrowly tailored its policy to achieve those diversity-related benefits—has proved equally critical in the Court's review of affirmative action policies. And once again owing to Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke , the Court appears to have embraced a model of what a narrowly tailored policy looks like: Harvard College's admissions program endorsed in Bakke , now more commonly known as the ""Harvard plan."" The Harvard plan has also provided the Court with a basis for developing more specific criteria for evaluating other affirmative action policies—what one court has described as the ""five hallmarks of a narrowly tailored affirmative action plan."" The first affirmative action program to come before the Court—the policy challenged in Bakke at U.C. Davis's Medical School—was also the first to falter under the Court's scrutiny. But because the Justices were unable to cobble together a majority there, they also settled on no single rationale for why the Medical School's policy could not survive the Court's scrutiny. This uncertainty left the lower courts without clear guidance on the permissibility of race-conscious admissions policies structured differently than the one struck down in Bakke . In announcing the judgment in Bakke , however, Justice Powell offered a clear reason why, in his view, the Medical School's policy could not survive a challenge under the Equal Protection Clause. The school's 16-seat set-aside for minority students was not ""the only effective means of serving [the school's] interest in diversity"" —in constitutional parlance, the set-aside was not narrowly tailored. And to explain why not, Justice Powell pointed to the Harvard plan as an example of an appropriately tailored affirmative action policy. That plan, according to Justice Powell, had several significant features that distinguished it—favorably—from the set-aside struck down in Bakk e : In [Harvard's] admissions program, race or ethnic background [is] deemed a ""plus"" in a particular applicant's file, yet it does not insulate the individual from comparison with all other candidates for the available seats. The file of a particular black applicant may be examined for his potential contribution to diversity without the factor of race being decisive when compared, for example, with that of an applicant identified as an Italian-American if the latter is thought to exhibit qualities more likely to promote beneficial educational pluralism. Such qualities could include exceptional personal talents, unique work or service experience, leadership potential, maturity, demonstrated compassion, a history of overcoming disadvantage, ability to communicate with the poor, or other qualifications deemed important ... [And] the weight attributed to a particular quality may vary from year to year depending upon the 'mix' both of the student body and the applicants for the incoming class. Unlike this ""flexible"" system of review, the Medical School policy at issue in Bakke was rigid: reserving a predetermined number of seats for a ""selected ethnic group."" In Justice Powell's view, that technique effectively precluded a more holistic review, that ""treats each applicant as an individual."" ""[R]ace or ethnic origin,"" as he saw it, did not serve as ""a single though important element"" of an applicant's file in the Medical School's policy; it had instead become a factor that ""foreclosed"" other applicants ""from all consideration for [certain] seat[s] simply because [they were] not the right color or had the wrong surname."" A program like that, Justice Powell concluded, could not be narrowly tailored—precisely because another more individualized and ""holistic"" model, like Harvard's, could serve instead. Even if Bakke suggested that the Court's scrutiny of a race-conscious admissions policy would be every bit as strict as for other racial classifications, later cases have made clear that such scrutiny need not always be fatal. The companion cases of Grutter v. Bollinger and Gratz v. Bollinger offer clear examples: each involved affirmative action admissions policies at the University of Michigan, and each yielded a different bottom line, with the Court upholding the Law School's policy in Grutter while striking down the university's undergraduate admissions policy in Gratz . But those diverging results appeared to proceed from a common starting point: how closely the challenged admissions policy resembled the Harvard plan. In the case of the Law School's admissions policy, the Court found the resemblance quite close. As Justice O'Connor explained for the Court in Grutter , ""the Law School engages in a highly individualized, holistic review of each applicant's file, giving serious consideration to all the ways an applicant might contribute to a diverse educational environment."" It therefore did not award ""mechanical, predetermined diversity 'bonuses' based on race or ethnicity."" And ""[l]ike the Harvard Plan, the Law School's admissions policy"" accorded each applicant the same sort of flexible consideration that Justice Powell had called for in Bakke . That ""policy st[ood] in sharp contrast,"" however, with the way the Court viewed the university's undergraduate admissions policy in Gratz . Under the undergraduate policy, admissions officers automatically awarded ""20 points, or one-fifth of the points needed to guarantee admission, to every single 'underrepresented minority' applicant solely because of race."" As Chief Justice Rehnquist explained for the Court, that policy therefore violated a basic feature of ""[t]he admission program Justice Powell described"" in Bakke —a program that ""did not contemplate that any single characteristic automatically ensured a specific and identifiable contribution to a university's diversity."" The result was a policy that did not ""offer applicants the individualized selection process described in Harvard's example,"" and that could consequently not pass strict scrutiny. On that point Justice O'Connor also agreed. As she explained in supplying her decisive fifth vote, the undergraduate policy simply did not ""enable[] admissions officers to make nuanced judgments with respect to the contributions each applicant is likely to make to the diversity of the incoming class,"" unlike the Law School's more holistic policy. This was true even though the undergraduate policy ""assign[ed] 20 points to some 'soft' variables other than race,"" such as ""leadership and service, personal achievement, and geographic diversity."" None of that, in Justice O'Connor's view, could counteract the more problematic effect of those factors' being ""capped at much lower levels,"" so that ""even the most outstanding national high school leader could never receive more than five points for his or her accomplishments—a mere quarter of the points automatically assigned to an underrepresented minority solely based on the fact of his or her race."" That weighting, though not problematic in all cases, had all but ensured there ""that the diversity contributions of applicants [could not] be individually assessed."" A thumb pressed that heavily on the racial scale, Justice O'Connor concluded, came too close to the ""nonindividualized, mechanical"" balancing condemned by Bakke to survive strict scrutiny. Despite their contrasting results, Gratz and Grutter gestured at several basic criteria by which to assess a university's race-conscious admissions policy. Those criteria, as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit later described them, could be summed up in ""five hallmarks of a narrowly tailored affirmative action plan."" And all five can be traced in one way or another to Justice Powell's analysis of the Harvard plan. 1. No Quotas. Perhaps the clearest violation of the requirement that a policy be narrowly tailored is the use of racial quotas. As Justice O'Connor explained in Grutter , a ""'quota' is a program in which a certain fixed number or proportion of opportunities are reserved exclusively for certain minority groups,"" consequently ""insulat[ing] the individual [applicant] from comparison with all other candidates for the available seats."" And as Justice Powell emphasized in Bakke , and as has been consistently reaffirmed by the Court since, ""[t]o be narrowly tailored, a race-conscious admissions program cannot use a quota system."" This ban on quotas therefore precludes the use of a rigid set-aside like the one challenged in Bakke . And it likewise rules out the sort of ""mechanical,"" automatic points system that was once in place at the University of Michigan's undergraduate college and was later invalidated in Gratz . 2. Individualized Consideration. The flip side of the Court's refusal to accept racial quotas has been its insistence on individualizing the consideration of applicants. As Justice Kennedy reaffirmed in Fisher I , echoing Justice Powell's description of the Harvard plan in Bakke , an appropriately tailored program ""must 'remain flexible enough to ensure that each applicant is evaluated as an individual and not in a way that makes an applicant's race or ethnicity the defining feature of his or her application.'"" And as the Court suggested in Gratz and Grutter , an acceptable plan will therefore engage in a ""highly individualized, holistic review of each applicant's file, giving serious consideration to all the ways an applicant might contribute to a diverse educational environment."" Such review allows ""the use of race as one of many 'plus factors' in an admissions program,"" like in the University of Michigan Law School's policy upheld in Grutter . It also appears to bar a school from ""automatically award[ing] points to applicants from certain racial minorities"" as an effectively decisive factor, as it became under the university's undergraduate policy. 3. Serious, Good-Faith Consideration of Race-Neutral or More Flexible Alternatives. Neither of these two criteria, however, implies that a university must exhaust ""every conceivable race-neutral alternative"" before turning to a race-conscious policy. Instead, a university need only provide evidence that it undertook ""serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives"" before resorting to its choice of a race-conscious plan, but that those alternatives either did not suffice to meet its approved educational goals or would have required some sacrifice of its ""reputation for academic excellence."" The same holds true, moreover, of more flexible race-conscious alternatives. Thus Justice Powell explained in Bakke that the Medical School's program was not narrowly tailored when the school could have adopted the more individualized, holistic program then in use at Harvard, an option the Medical School apparently did not consider. 4. No Undue Harm. Even though the Court has allowed the use of race-conscious admissions policies under the exacting standard of strict scrutiny, it has also long ""acknowledge[d] that 'there are serious problems of justice connected with the idea of preference itself.'"" In Grutter , Justice O'Connor drew another corollary from that apparent discomfort with racial preferences. ""[A] race-conscious admissions program,"" she explained, must ""not unduly harm members of any racial group."" What this corollary means more specifically remains unclear; so far it has received only passing attention from the Court. At the least, Justice O'Connor suggested, a race-conscious admissions policy must not ""unduly burden individuals who are not members of the favored racial and ethnic groups."" And in Grutter , Justice O'Connor put more flesh on that analysis: an affirmative action policy that closely resembled the Harvard plan, she suggested, would not ""unduly harm"" other applicants. It remains to be seen, however, whether this principle might take on new life in the Court's review of other plans. 5. Ongoing Review. In Grutter , Justice O'Connor also drew a fifth and final corollary from the basic premise that the Fourteenth Amendment was meant ""to do away with all governmentally imposed discrimination based on race."" ""[R]ace-conscious admissions policies,"" she concluded, ""must be limited in time."" This requirement, Justice O'Connor explained for the Court, reflected a consideration apparently unique to racial classifications: ""however compelling their goals, [they] are potentially so dangerous that they may be employed no more broadly than the interest demands."" Doctrinally, this meant there could be no ""permanent justification"" for race-conscious admissions policies in higher education; sooner or later they had to end, as the university conceded in its briefing. Practically, this ""logical end point"" could come in one of several ways. It could take the form of an explicit ""durational limit,"" such as a sunset provision. Or it could arrive as a result of ""periodic reviews to determine whether racial preferences are still necessary to achieve student body diversity."" But, however a university chooses to pursue that end, it has an ""ongoing obligation to engage in constant deliberation and continued reflection regarding its admissions policies"" and the role race plays in them, or whether it should continue to play one at all. For several Justices this ongoing obligation of review also pointed to something more definite—an expiration date, when ""the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further [the school's] interest"" in student body diversity. Looking back over the quarter-century since Bakke , Justice O'Connor ""expect[ed]"" that day to come twenty-five years after casting her deciding votes in Gratz and Grutter —ten years from this writing. What exactly this meant, as either a practical or doctrinal matter, also remains unclear. Indeed, even then several of her fellow Justices seemed less sure, or simply unsure, what to make of that unusually specific constitutional deadline. But with six Justices having since departed the Court, Justices O'Connor and Kennedy included, it remains to be seen whether in the next ten years race-conscious admissions policies will reach this foreordained ""logical end point."" What seems clear for now, however, is that the Harvard plan described in Bakke remains the Court's working model of a constitutionally satisfactory race-conscious admissions policy. And that, as the Court has consistently said since, is a policy capable of achieving the diversity ""essential"" to the life of a modern university, while still ""treat[ing] each applicant as an individual."" Race has come to play two major doctrinal roles in higher education today, mirroring the two senses of ""affirmative action"" discussed in this report: the mandatory role, rooted in the affirmative obligation states have to eliminate the vestiges of de jure segregation, and the voluntary role, particularly in admissions decisions at selective colleges and universities. In the context of higher education, the Court has so far considered these two forms of ""affirmative action"" only in relation to public universities, and then primarily as a matter of constitutional law, under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. But many of those cases have also involved claims brought under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI or the Act). And while the Court has read Title VI's protections to overlap with the Equal Protection Clause, Congress still has a significant say over the substantive scope of Title VI as well as its enforcement. Title VI generally protects participants in federally funded ""program[s] or activit[ies]"" from discrimination based on their ""race, color, or national origin."" To ensure that statutory right, the Act grants all federal funding agencies the authority to issue implementing regulations, and the power to enforce the regulations they issue. In practice, much of the interpretive authority falls to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), and for educational programs, the U.S. Department of Education (ED). Both DOJ and ED have also established their own processes for receiving and investigating complaints of suspected Title VI violations. ED, meanwhile, has also issued its own set of rules to govern the federal education dollars it disburses each year, reaching some 4,700 colleges and universities. Every agency that awards federal funds—ED included—has the authority not just to issue implementing regulations but to enforce those rules against noncompliant recipients, including through an investigation that may, upon a finding of noncompliance, result in the termination, suspension, or refusal to grant federal funds. Thus, for example, where ED finds a school in violation of Title VI or its implementing regulations the department may seek to cut off federal funding through an ""administrative fund termination proceeding,"" as it has in at least some cases. And since the passage of the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, the courts have read the scope of liability under Title VI broadly. With respect to the termination of funds, a Title VI violation in one program at a college or university could therefore jeopardize funding for the institution as a whole. Withdrawing funds may be the ultimate means of enforcing Title VI, but it is far from exclusive. DOJ, for its part, has also sought to achieve compliance through the federal courts, intervening in some private suits alleging Title VI violations and otherwise representing executive branch agencies, such as ED, in lawsuits seeking enforcement of Title VI. DOJ has participated in cases challenging practices of formerly de jure segregated public university systems as well as in settlements resolving such Fordice -related claims. DOJ has also taken a position in cases challenging affirmative action admissions policies, most recently in the ongoing litigation surrounding Harvard College's admissions policies. ED has ventured into this area as well, having recently opened investigations into the admissions decisions at several prominent private universities. Congress continues to have considerable say over how Title VI works—at least within the parameters of the Supreme Court's equal protection jurisprudence. Perhaps the most direct way of doing so is by amendment. As a general matter, Congress could revise Title VI in one of two directions, to make the statute either (1) more restrictive than the Court's current Equal Protection jurisprudence or (2) expressly permissive of race-conscious measures that the Court has upheld or has thus far not addressed. In the more restrictive direction, Congress could prohibit recipients of federal funds from using voluntary race-conscious measures at all—a result that four Justices in Bakke argued Title VI already requires, but which the Court has so far not embraced. A statutory revision of that kind would also implicitly reject the Harvard Plan discussed in Bakke , by excluding race as a permissible factor in admissions decisions at the many universities subject to Title VI, including the many private universities that receive federal funds. And, consequently, an amendment along these lines would make unlawful the type of admissions policies that the Court has approved under the Equal Protection Clause, like those at issue in Grutter and Fisher II . On the other hand, Congress could expressly open other avenues for effectuating Title VI's antidiscrimination mandate. This could include incorporating a private right of action to bring suit under Title VI, which, at present, is an implied right with no statutorily defined remedies. More consequentially, Congress could also amend Title VI to provide for disparate impact liability—that is, a Title VI violation based on a funding recipient's use of certain policies or practices that disproportionately and negatively impact members of a protected class, as already exists under Title VII of the same Act. A provision addressing disparate impact liability—either its availability or foreclosure under Title VI—would resolve a significant and ongoing debate on the issue. Such an addition would also be one way of clarifying whether Congress does in fact intend for Title VI to be read coextensively with the Equal Protection Clause. Beyond legislative amendments, Congress also exercises oversight over the agencies charged with carrying out Title VI's antidiscrimination mandate. As discussed earlier, DOJ and ED are primarily responsible for enforcing Title VI in educational programs. For its part, ED investigates and seeks compliance through its Office for Civil Rights, while the Educational Opportunities Section of the Department of Justice's (DOJ's) Civil Rights Division typically enforces Title VI in educational programs for the department. Both offices maintain public archives documenting their past and current investigations, as well as wider-ranging reports detailing their enforcement priorities and investigatory procedures. And because Title VI applies to a wide variety of entities that receive federal financial assistance, not just colleges and universities, DOJ also publishes news and updates on Title VI enforcement activity in other programmatic areas, from agencies across the federal government. Race has come to play two major doctrinal roles in higher education today, reflecting the two senses of ""affirmative action"" discussed in this report. ""Affirmative action"" in its original sense grew out of the affirmative obligation imposed on the states by the Equal Protection Clause to eliminate the vestiges of de jure segregation from their public schools. And in that sense, ""affirmative action"" involves the mandatory use of race-conscious measures in higher education to right the enduring wrongs of state-sanctioned segregation. But ""affirmative action"" has also come to refer to race-conscious policies outside this de jure context—policies voluntarily adopted by institutions to help racial minorities overcome the effects of their earlier exclusion. In higher education, none has been more salient—or stirred more debate—than the race-conscious admissions policies that colleges and universities across the country have used to diversify their student bodies. Thus far, remedial measures addressing de jure segregation, and voluntary measures designed to promote student-body diversity, have been the only race-conscious measures that the Court has approved under the Equal Protection Clause. And both remain areas of active litigation and administrative enforcement. Over the years, however, the Court has made it clear that it will subject voluntary ""affirmative action"" policies to especially close scrutiny, approving them only when they can be shown to be narrowly tailored to serve compelling educational goals. It has approved such polices twice already, most recently in 2016. Still, several Justices have suggested that the rationales supporting these voluntary race-conscious measures will one day run out. But for the time being, at least, these two lines of authority nevertheless provide a place for affirmative action in higher education today. This authority, however, leaves questions as of yet unexplored. It appears to be an open question, for example, whether a public institution of higher education can cite its own history of intentional exclusion, or else its ""past discrimination,"" as a basis for adopting a race-conscious admissions policy, among other measures. Whether—and how—the courts might assess such untested arguments would likely turn on a range of factors, including the further development of the two lines of authority addressed in this report. Regardless of those and other possible developments, however, Congress still has a significant say in in this area, through its authority not just to revise Title VI but to oversee the Act's enforcement.\n\n","['When federal courts have analyzed and addressed ""affirmative action"" in higher education, they have done so in two distinct but related senses, both under the Fourteenth Amendment\'s guarantee of ""equal protection."" The first has its roots in the original sense of ""affirmative action:"" the mandatory use of race by public education systems to eliminate the remnants of state-imposed racial segregation. Because state-sanctioned race segregation in public education violates the Fourteenth Amendment\'s Equal Protection Clause, in certain cases involving a state\'s formerly de jure segregated public university system, a state\'s consideration of race in its higher education policies and practices may be an affirmative obligation. As the U.S. Supreme Court explained in its consequential 1992 decision United States v. Fordice, equal protection may require states that formerly maintained de jure segregated university systems to consider race for the purpose of eliminating all vestiges of their prior ""dual"" systems. Drawing upon its precedent addressing racially segregated public schools in the K-12 context, the Court established a three-part legal standard in Fordice for evaluating the sufficiency and effectiveness of a state\'s efforts in ""dismantl[ing]"" its formerly de jure segregated public university system. To that remedial end, mandatory race-conscious measures—in this de jure context—are not limited to admissions. Instead, remedies may also address policies and practices relating to academic programs, institutional missions, funding, and other aspects of public university operations. Outside this de jure context, ""affirmative action"" has come to refer to a different category of race-conscious policies. These involve what the Court at one time called the ""benign"" use of racial classifications—voluntary measures designed not to remedy past de jure discrimination, but to help racial minorities overcome the effects of their earlier exclusion. And for institutions of higher education, the Court has addressed one type of affirmative action policy in particular: the use of race as a factor in admissions decisions, a practice now widely observed by both public and private colleges and universities. The federal courts have come to subject these voluntary race-conscious policies—""affirmative action"" in its perhaps more familiar sense—to a particularly searching form of review known as strict scrutiny. And even though this heightened judicial scrutiny has long been regarded as strict in theory but fatal in fact, the Court\'s review of race-conscious admissions policies in higher education has proved a notable exception, with the Court having twice upheld universities\' use of race as one of many factors considered when assembling their incoming classes. The Court has long grappled with this seeming tension—between the strictness of its scrutiny and its approval of race-conscious admissions policies—beginning with its landmark 1978 decision in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke through its 2016 decision in Fisher v. University of Texas. Though the Equal Protection Clause generally concerns public universities and their constitutional obligations under the Fourteenth Amendment, federal statutory law also plays a role in ensuring equal protection in higher education. To that end, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits recipients of federal funding—including private colleges and universities—from, at a minimum, discriminating against students and applicants in a manner that would violate the Equal Protection Clause. Federal agencies, including the Departments of Justice and Education, investigate and administratively enforce institutions\' compliance with Title VI.']","12474","gov_report","en","None","96b798b0de90fbfdfec8755d41a218bde7e0439dd5a8bc98","Summary:","gov_report","532","\nThe report discusses"
"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nThe Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Rehabilitation Act), as amended by WIOA, authorizes a number of grant programs to support employment and independent living for persons with disabilities, including the State Vocational Rehabilitation Services program. This program is the primary federal government effort to help individuals with disabilities prepare for and obtain employment. An individual who is deemed eligible works with state VR agency staff to prepare an individualized plan for employment, which describes the employment goal and the specific services needed to achieve that goal. Education’s Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) awards funds to state VR agencies through the program to help individuals with disabilities engage in gainful employment. States must provide a 21.3 percent nonfederal match of these funds. In fiscal year 2016, total program funds for VR—including state match funds—were $3.81 billion. States, territories, and the District of Columbia generally designate a single agency to administer the program, although, depending on state law, states may designate more than one agency. Twenty-three states have two separate agencies, one that exclusively serves blind and visually impaired individuals (known as agencies for the blind) and another that serves individuals who are not blind or visually impaired (known as general agencies). Twenty-seven states, the District of Columbia, and the five territories have a single combined agency that serves both blind and visually impaired individuals and individuals with other types of impairments (known as combined agencies). In total, there are 79 state VR agencies. In 2014, WIOA amended the Rehabilitation Act to require state VR agencies to provide students with disabilities with pre-employment transition services. According to information Education provided with its regulations, WIOA emphasized the provision of services to students with disabilities to ensure that they have meaningful opportunities to receive training and other supports and services they need to achieve employment outcomes. WIOA requires states to make pre-employment transition services available statewide to all students with disabilities in need of such services, who are eligible or potentially eligible, regardless of whether a student has submitted an application for services from a state VR agency. In this context, students with disabilities include those with an individualized education program (IEP) for special education services through the school system, those receiving an accommodation for their disability, and others. In information provided with the regulations, Education stated that state VR agencies should work closely with school systems and others to identify these students. WIOA requires each state to reserve at least 15 percent of a state’s VR allotment for a fiscal year for pre-employment transition services for students with disabilities. If a state cannot use or match all of its VR funding, it relinquishes funds to the federal government and the state’s total award amount is then reduced. However, the state must still reserve 15 percent of what it did not relinquish for the provision of pre- employment transition services. WIOA established required activities under pre-employment transition services that states must make available to students with disabilities. Education has provided states with additional information about each of the activities (see table 1). After making the required pre-employment transition services available, if a state has funding remaining, WIOA lists nine other “authorized” activities that a state may implement. For example, in providing the authorized activities, states may, among other things, provide training to local VR and educational service providers; coordinate transition services with local educational agencies; and disseminate information about innovative, effective, and efficient approaches to achieve the goals (see appendix II for a full listing of authorized activities). Education’s guidance indicates that such authorized activities should improve the transition of students with disabilities from school to postsecondary education or an employment outcome and support the arrangement or provision of the required activities. WIOA also requires local offices of state VR agencies to conduct coordination responsibilities, which includes coordinating with state and local educational agencies to ensure the provision of pre-employment transition services. These can be conducted concurrently with the “required” activities, and states can use the reserved funds for them. Examples of coordination responsibilities that local offices of state VR agencies must undertake are attending meetings, when invited, about IEPs; and working with the local public workforce system and employers to develop work opportunities for students with disabilities. In support of this coordination and in recognition that VR and educational agencies both offer transition services to students, WIOA requires that VR agencies establish or update their interagency agreements with states educational agencies. Interagency agreements between the state VR and educational agencies are intended to describe the steps each agency will take to implement pre-employment transition services and determine the roles and responsibilities of each agency, including financial responsibilities and procedures for identifying students in need of pre- employment transition services. Following the passage of WIOA, Education, through its Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA), issued regulations and guidance to implement pre-employment transition services requirements (see fig. 1). Education also provided technical assistance to state VR agencies through webinars, conference calls, and presentations at conferences. For example, Education presented information to state officials in a series of webinars about the new programmatic and financial processes and procedures related to pre-employment transition services just after the final regulations were issued in 2016. In addition, Education funded technical assistance centers to help state VR agencies and their partners answer questions and provide training about WIOA. Two of these centers are the Workforce Innovation Technical Assistance Center (WINTAC) and the National Technical Assistance Center on Transition (NTACT). Each center focuses its efforts on a specific set of issues: WINTAC on helping state VR agencies implement WIOA requirements, including pre- employment transition services; and NTACT on helping state VR and educational agencies improve outcomes for students receiving transition services. RSA is to conduct periodic monitoring visits to assess state VR agencies’ implementation of the VR program, including pre-employment transition services. RSA is to monitor states for compliance with the administrative, financial, and performance requirements of the program, as well as identify technical assistance needs at individual state VR agencies. According to Education officials, RSA plans to follow a 5-year monitoring cycle that began in fiscal year 2017 and will generally include monitoring visits to 10 states per year through fiscal year 2021. In fiscal year 2017, Education visited 14 VR agencies in 10 states, and in fiscal year 2018, Education plans to visit 15 VR agencies in 12 states. Most state VR agencies that responded to our survey reported expanding services for students with disabilities since WIOA’s enactment in July 2014 by either serving more students through pre-employment transition services or by initiating new or additional services. Most state VR agencies that responded to our survey reported that they provided the five required activities to more students with disabilities since WIOA’s enactment (see fig. 2). State VR agencies indicated in their survey responses that they had previously provided and continue to provide transition services to students who apply and are eligible for the VR program, and many of the activities were not entirely new to state VR agencies. Most agencies that responded to our survey reported providing each of the required activities to students with disabilities before the enactment of WIOA, while fewer reported initiating these services since enactment (see fig. 3). Of the five required activities, instruction in self-advocacy saw the biggest expansion during this time. In information provided with the regulations, Education described instruction in self-advocacy as, for example, classroom lessons in which students learn about their rights, responsibilities, and how to request accommodations or services and supports needed during transition. In written comments on our survey, 10 state VR agencies reported partnering with other organizations, such as universities or centers for independent living, to provide instruction in self- advocacy. One agency reported on our survey that it offers peer mentoring as an additional component of self-advocacy services, and another reported providing self-advocacy and mentoring for deaf-blind students by deaf-blind adults. In October 2016, based on views of an expert panel that we convened on autism spectrum disorders and transitioning youth, we reported that it is critically important that all transitioning youth, regardless of their level of disability, be given the opportunity to state their own preferences to the extent of their capabilities to reach their maximum independence. State VR agencies reported developing additional programming as a result of WIOA’s enactment, including expanding programs for more students, adding new opportunities and experiences, and creating new partnerships. Officials from all four of the state VR agencies we interviewed said they had programs in place prior to WIOA that offered activities similar to pre-employment transition services, but they have since expanded these services or created additional programs for students with disabilities. For example, an official we interviewed from the Idaho Division of Vocational Rehabilitation said the agency had previously worked to enroll students in the VR program prior to graduation, but has since begun developing new programming and instruction aimed at serving larger groups and providing other services, such as a paid work experience. An official from Maryland’s Division of Rehabilitation Services said many of the services they previously offered were during school hours, and students had limited access to these services if they wanted to stay in class. The agency has since added services after school and during the summer, such as opportunities for students to meet with employers, according to Maryland officials. Officials from the Illinois Department of Human Services, Division of Rehabilitation Services, said that while the agency had previously provided work-based learning experiences, it has since expanded the number of spots available for students in an existing program and created a new work-based learning program that is a collaboration between school districts, a community rehabilitation partner, and businesses. Providing new services with specific requirements to an expanded population has been a significant change, according to officials in one of the state VR agencies we interviewed and in all three of our discussion groups. For example, officials from Maryland’s Division of Rehabilitation Services said that, while they provided all five required activities before WIOA, they now provide the activities to a younger population and make the activities available statewide. State VR officials in all three of our discussion groups said that providing pre-employment transition services allows them to provide these services to more students with disabilities or at an earlier age, which will likely have positive effects on students’ transition from school to work. For example, officials in one discussion group noted that the provision of pre-employment transition services is increasing awareness, enhancing services, and increasing the likelihood that VR program outcomes will improve. In another discussion group, officials said their agencies had already seen benefits from pre- employment transition services and the services have raised students’ expectations for the types of jobs they might obtain. While 32 of the state VR agencies responding to our survey reported that they had identified all potentially eligible students, another 37 reported that they were currently in the process of identifying these students. State VR officials in all three of our discussion groups and who we interviewed in two of four state VR agencies said they have had challenges finding the population eligible for services. In written comments on our survey, one agency reported that while statewide information on students was not readily available, officials worked with the state educational agency to identify potentially eligible students, including more than 137,000 students with an IEP and an estimated 13,000 additional students that do not have an IEP. We previously reported on the difficulties state VR officials faced in obtaining data they could use to identify other youth with disabilities. Compared to combined and general agencies, more agencies for the blind reported in our survey that they did not provide the five required activities to more students with disabilities, and officials in some of these agencies said they can serve a much smaller population. For example, 57 percent (12 of 21) of agencies for the blind reported providing job exploration counseling to more students, compared to 83 percent (25 of 30) of combined agencies and 91 percent (20 of 22) of general agencies since WIOA enactment. Similarly, 67 percent (14 of 21) of agencies for the blind reported providing work-based learning experiences to more students, compared to 83 percent (25 of 30) for combined agencies and 86 percent (19 of 22) for general agencies. Officials in some of these agencies for the blind and from the National Council of State Agencies for the Blind (NCSAB) told us in interviews that agencies for the blind have far fewer potentially eligible students they could serve compared to other types of agencies. For example, officials we interviewed with Idaho’s Commission for the Blind and Visually Impaired said that Idaho has only 40 students being provided pre-employment transition services. In contrast, the Idaho Division of Vocational Rehabilitation reportedly provided at least one pre-employment transition service to approximately 700 students in a one-year period. The ability of agencies for the blind to serve more students may also be restricted because they are not able to provide pre-employment transition services to younger students in some cases, according to officials with NCSAB and Idaho’s Commission for the Blind and Visually Impaired. NCSAB officials told us that state VR agencies have traditionally provided VR services to youth who are blind or visually impaired at younger ages compared to general agencies that serve youth with other types of disabilities. The ages at which students may be provided pre-employment transition services varied by agency, based on responses to our survey, but the most common age range reported across all types of agencies was 14 to 21 years old. According to Education officials, as a result of WIOA, two agencies in the same state must agree on a common age range during which students can be provided pre-employment transition services. Most agencies in states with two VR agencies responding to our survey (35 of 44) reported agreeing on an age range for receiving pre- employment transition services. NCSAB officials said that in some cases agencies for the blind have had to raise the minimum age at which they would begin providing services to students. Officials with Idaho’s Commission for the Blind and Visually Impaired, for example, said they would prefer to begin services at younger ages because their agency has the resources to do so. However, officials with Idaho’s Division of Vocational Rehabilitation said they do not have the resources to provide pre-employment transition services to the relatively large number of students with disabilities at a younger age. State VR agencies reported taking a range of actions to build their administrative capacity to implement pre-employment transition services. These actions included building staff capacity and expanding contracts with services providers. Building staff capacity. Most state VR agencies reported building staff capacity to facilitate and carry out the requirements of pre- employment transition services by: Establishing a new specialist position. More than half (45 of 74) of VR agencies reported in our survey establishing at least one new transition specialist position specifically for pre-employment transition services. For example, the Idaho Division of Vocational Rehabilitation reported establishing this position and officials told us that they hired a specialist who was previously the transition coordinator for the state’s educational agency. In written comments on our survey, a respondent from another state commented that their agency has hired 20 pre-employment transition services specialists to provide the five required activities. Officials we interviewed from Maryland’s Division of Rehabilitation Services said they added six salaried positions dedicated to providing pre-employment transition services. Another agency responding to our survey reported dedicating a supervisor and 15 percent of their counselors exclusively to this purpose. Training staff. All 74 state VR agencies reported providing training on pre-employment transition services to their staff. For example, in written comments, one agency reported developing training tools for its counselors, such as answers to frequently asked questions, posting guidance on its intranet, and having WINTAC provide training. Expanding contracts and agreements with service providers. In addition to being provided by state VR agency staff, pre-employment services can be offered through a variety of methods and service providers, and many state VR agencies reported entering into new or additional contracts with service providers or expanding contracts with existing providers. Pre-employment transition services can be provided directly by state VR agency staff or through agreements with third parties, such as community rehabilitation programs, independent living agencies, public colleges and universities, and school districts. In our survey, 62 of 74 agencies reported entering into new or additional contracts with third-party providers to provide pre- employment transition services. Officials we interviewed from three of four state VR agencies said they either established or expanded existing contracts and agreements. For example, officials from the Illinois Department of Human Service, Division of Rehabilitation Services told us that after the enactment of WIOA, they expanded arrangements with independent living centers and initiated a new program that provides students with work experiences. Agencies reported several examples of approaches using third parties: establishing contracts with community rehabilitation programs to partnering with independent living agencies to work with youth on entering into provider agreements with local workforce centers to assist with providing job preparation and a paid work experience, developing programs with public colleges and universities focused on financial literacy and self-advocacy, and contracting with individual school districts to deliver services in the school environment. Twenty-one of 56 states (50 states, 5 territories, and the District of Columbia) reported using the full amount of grant funds they reserved for pre-employment transition services for students with disabilities for fiscal year 2016, according to the most recent full year of data available from Education (see fig. 4). In aggregate, states reportedly expended approximately $357 million out of the approximately $465 million reserved (about $108 million less than the target) for fiscal year 2016. For fiscal year 2015, states reportedly expended approximately $324 million on pre-employment transition services out of the approximately $453 million reserved for that purpose (about $130 million less than the target). Results from our 2017 survey of state VR agencies revealed similar trends: Fewer than half the 74 agencies reported that they used at least 15 percent of their VR grant allotment each year. Thirty-two of the 74 agencies responding to our survey reported using the minimum required 15 percent of federal VR grant funds reserved for the provision of pre- employment transition services for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. For fiscal year 2015, 25 agencies reported using the required 15 percent minimum reserved funds. Officials we interviewed in two of four state VR agencies and officials in all three discussion groups explained that some of the services they generally provided to participants in the VR program are not allowable for the funds reserved for pre-employment transition services. These expenditures included transportation, tuition, and others associated with individualized services. For example, officials in Maryland’s Division of Rehabilitation Services told us that transportation costs for students to get to the place where the services are provided are not covered. VR agency officials in two of our discussion groups told us that assistive technology, such as hearing aids, could not be paid for with the 15 percent of funds reserved for pre-employment transition services. In another group, participants said that some expenditures, such as tuition or for the services of a job coach to help students with the most significant disabilities, could not be paid with reserved funds. In information provided with the regulations, Education stated that it does not have the statutory authority to allow these expenditures to be paid for with the funds reserved for pre-employment transition services and these services must be paid with other VR funds. When it promulgated its final regulations, Education noted that state VR agencies would experience challenges in using their funds because many of the services provided to students with disabilities prior to WIOA’s enactment would not qualify as pre-employment transition services. Education reviewed past expenditures for a subset of students and estimated that 82 percent of state VR agencies’ reported purchases for those students would not meet the statutory definition of pre-employment services under WIOA. Education concluded that states would have to reach a larger number of students with disabilities in order to meet the spending requirement and that state VR agencies would need to develop and implement aggressive strategies to expend these funds in these initial years of implementation. According to WINTAC officials, state VR agency officials are commonly unclear about what kinds of activities they can provide using the funds reserved for pre-employment transition services. For instance, they said that states must make required activities (e.g. work-based learning experiences and self-advocacy) available to all students with disabilities before providing authorized activities (e.g. model projects, partnerships), in accordance with WIOA. However, state officials have commonly interpreted that to mean that all students must actually receive the required activities before the agency can begin providing other activities, according to WINTAC officials. WINTAC officials explained that states may have been conducting authorized or coordination activities without knowing these activities could be paid for with the reserved funds. None of the state VR agency officials we interviewed said they had yet moved beyond providing required activities to providing authorized activities. Officials from two of the agencies we interviewed told us they were in the process of planning authorized activities. For example, officials with the Idaho Division of Vocational Rehabilitation said they were completing an assessment of their needs, which would help them plan authorized activities. Officials we interviewed from the other two agencies—the Idaho Commission for the Blind and Visually Impaired and the Illinois Division of Rehabilitation Services—said they did not have the resources to provide authorized activities or were unsure about how to properly transition from required to authorized activities under the current guidance. Education communicated with states on broad requirements but provided little detailed information directly to states on the allowable use of funds reserved for pre-employment transition services. Education provided information when it promulgated final regulations, in grant award notifications, on its website, and in presentations at conferences. In each of these formats, Education described activities on which states could not spend funds, but provided little detailed information on what expenditures are allowed. Regulations: Education’s final regulations restate many provisions in WIOA, including the prohibition on using any of the reserved funds for administrative costs. In responding to comments it received on its proposed regulations, Education provided examples of services that commenters requested would be considered pre-employment transition services, such as, postsecondary education, on-the-job supports, job coaching, travel expenses, and uniforms. In information provided with the regulations, Education explained that it had no statutory authority to expand or limit the pre-employment transition services listed in WIOA. Education stated that a state VR agency can allocate costs associated with staff time spent providing pre- employment transition services, including an employee’s salary and fringe benefits, to the funds reserved for pre-employment transition services. However, Education did not provide additional information on what specific types of expenditures states were permitted to spend funds on in providing pre-employment transition services as required by WIOA. Grant award notification: The notification that accompanies each state’s VR grant award lists the three sets of activities for which the reserved money can be used: required, authorized, and coordination; it lists each of the activities as they are listed in WIOA. It also discusses the prohibition on using any of the reserved funds for administrative costs. It does not list or describe what specific expenditures the reserved funds can be used for to undertake each of the listed activities. Education’s website: A list of frequently asked questions on Education’s website outlines the requirements of WIOA and explains that the reserved funds must only be used to provide pre-employment transition services as listed in WIOA. Similar to the regulations, the website explains that the total costs of an employee’s salary and fringe benefits may be allocated to the reserved funds if that employee is providing only pre-employment transition services to students with disabilities but does not include additional detail for any other expenditures. Presentation materials: In one set of presentation materials, Education provided an example of a potential allowable expenditure for one of the required activities, work-based learning. It did not include information on allowable expenditures for the other four required activities, or any of the nine authorized activities. In another set of presentation materials, Education provided examples of services for each of the five required pre-employment transition services activities. According to Education officials, these examples would be allowable expenditures. Education, however, provided the most detailed information through WINTAC. WINTAC’s website provided answers to some specific questions on the use of funds reserved for pre-employment transition services. In one set of frequently asked questions, WINTAC included a list of 28 questions with detailed answers, including what specific expenditures may be charged to the reserved funds. For example, based upon guidance issued by RSA, the website explains that reserved funds may be used to pay for auxiliary aids and services, such as interpreters, if they are directly related to one of the five required pre-employment transition services activities. However, the reserved funds may not be used to pay for the costs of foreign language interpreters because they are not an auxiliary aid or serve that is required due to the individual’s disability. WINTAC’s website also included answers provided by Education on 13 other frequently asked questions. Information included that reserved funds cannot be used to pay for the cost of an assessment to determine whether a student met the definition of a student with a disability; they can be used to pay for items required by an employer for work-based learning activities. Some state VR agencies we surveyed and those that participated in one of our three discussion groups said they would like more detailed information directly from Education. Seven survey respondents reported that they would like Education to provide answers to their specific questions. In one discussion group, participants noted that when states approach WINTAC with a new question, the technical assistance center sometimes needs to obtain the answer from Education. This process can be inefficient at times. In addition, the answer may not be broadly shared with all the states, limiting its benefit, whereas information issued directly from Education could help communicate the answer more efficiently and broadly. One survey respondent reported, for example, that guidance varied by source—training, Education’s RSA staff, or technical assistance center websites—and said that Education should provide all state VR agencies with the same information at the same time. According to standards for federal internal control, management should communicate externally through reporting lines so that external parties can help the entity achieve its objectives and address related risks. Management should also periodically evaluate its methods of communication so it has the appropriate tools to communicate quality information throughout and outside of the entity on a timely basis. Education officials said that during fiscal years 2015 and 2016, states were unclear about allowable expenditures using reserved funds, and that they plan to clarify guidance as they learn about the issues from states during their monitoring. According to Education officials, they respond to issues that need clarification and provide answers to questions as part of formal monitoring visits or through other communications with state agencies. Education officials said they expect to complete a round of monitoring visits to all states by the end of fiscal year 2021. However, an Education official said they have no timeframe for providing further information on allowable costs to states. With better information on timeframes for when this information will be provided, states would be able to better plan their use of the remaining funds reserved for pre- employment transition services. Most state VR agencies (61 of 74) that responded to our survey reported providing training on pre-employment transition services along with their state’s educational agency since WIOA’s enactment in 2014. Joint training may help coordination between state VR and educational agencies, as state VR officials participating in our discussion groups said that some educators were not familiar with pre-employment transition services. Similarly, an official we interviewed from Idaho’s state educational agency said it was common in the past for teachers and VR counselors not to know one another. Joint trainings provided to VR staff and teachers have improved these relationships, and teachers can invite VR counselors to students’ IEP meetings, the official said. Joint training includes staff presentations at conferences and participation in other training sessions. For example, officials we interviewed from the Idaho Division of Vocational Rehabilitation said their transition coordinator has given presentations to education directors around the state about changes resulting from WIOA and how the inclusion of pre-employment transition services can affect special education for the school districts. In written comments on our survey, one agency reported that it co-sponsors an annual conference with VR, special education, developmental services, and other public and private entities. During this conference, they plan how to improve services for students with disabilities. About one-third of state VR agencies (23 of 74) reported issuing joint guidance with their state’s educational agency, a recommended practice according to WINTAC. The other two-thirds of survey respondents reported that joint guidance was either in progress (27 of 74) or that they had not issued such guidance (23 of 74). Joint guidance can include written policies and procedures that are created by and provided to state VR and educational agency staff. For example, in written comments on our survey, one agency reported developing written policies and guidance for transition counselors that the state educational agency endorses and provides to special education staff. In Maryland, VR and special education officials told us that they issued guidance through jointly created materials on pre-employment transition services. Less than half the state VR agencies that responded to our survey (34 of 74) reported updating their interagency agreement with their state’s educational agency, which is intended to facilitate collaboration and coordination on delivery of pre-employment transition services. The majority of agencies reported that their agreement is either in progress (37 of 74) or not yet updated (3 of 74). These required agreements outline how VR agencies and schools will plan and coordinate service provision, provide for each agency’s responsibilities, including financial responsibilities, and provide for student outreach procedures, among other things. Discussion group participants and CSAVR representatives emphasized the value of completing their interagency agreements with the state educational agency. In one group, officials whose agencies had completed their agreements said they are essential for state VR agencies to provide services in schools. Participants in another discussion group explained that once they have a state-level agreement in place, they can discuss what services school districts need for students and then determine how to provide those services. According to state educational agency officials we interviewed, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requirements are similar to requirements for pre-employment transition services, and they need to coordinate with VR officials at both the state and local levels to agree on each agency’s assigned tasks and expectations. These officials said state VR and educational agencies should coordinate funding to make services available where they are needed and to complement each other’s transition efforts. Illinois’s agreement, for example, specifies that the state educational agency is responsible for providing outreach, guidance, and coordination to local educational agencies regarding the provision of pre-employment transition services. According to the agreement, Illinois’s VR agency is responsible for providing pre-employment transition services, both directly and through cooperative agreements with local educational agencies, and for providing written information to the state educational agency regarding services available to students with disabilities. Officials we interviewed with CSAVR said state VR agencies that have made progress in developing their interagency agreements with state educational agencies tend to be more successful in implementing pre-employment transition services. According to Education officials, Education provides guidance and technical assistance on interagency agreements to states as part of Education’s monitoring or when asked by states. Education officials said they provide technical assistance during periodic monitoring visits, which are currently limited to about 10 states per year from fiscal years 2017- 2021; by helping state VR agencies develop policies and procedures; and by making sure pre-employment transition services are coordinated with the state educational agency and through interagency agreements. According to Education officials, there is no statutory provision authorizing Education to identify states that have not updated their interagency agreement. Education officials said they do not collect information from state VR agencies on the status of these agreements except when they conduct monitoring visits in specific states. In addition, Education officials said that when monitoring, they may meet with state educational agency partners to help them understand the new components of pre- employment transition services in an agreement, or they may refer the state agencies to WINTAC or NTACT resources. Providing assistance during monitoring may be helpful for some states. However, given that less than half of state VR agencies we surveyed reported updating and finalizing their agreements and Education officials say they will take another three years to complete this round of monitoring, additional action by Education may be needed to raise awareness among the remaining states about the importance of these agreements to help states coordinate services to students with disabilities. Additional action could include, for example, conducting earlier state outreach or monitoring to assess state progress on finalizing the interagency agreements and offering technical assistance when appropriate. However, Education officials said there is no requirement that state educational agencies provide pre-employment transition services to meet their obligations to IDEA-eligible students with disabilities under part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. As a result, WINTAC and participants in our discussion groups explained that it can be difficult to get state educational agencies to work with state VR agencies to update interagency agreements. Education officials said that WIOA requires state VR agencies to update these interagency agreements to include pre- employment transition services but they do not track their completion because states are not required to report when the agreements are finalized. Moreover, Education officials said they have heard from states that some reasons that interagency agreements are not specifically updated are that the agreements are written broadly enough so that they can remain in effect when there are additional changes to the law, the details of actual practices are rarely reflected in the high level of an interagency agreement, and that modifications to agreements are time- consuming and would not result in changes to the interagency coordination practice. Without an updated agreement between the state VR and educational agencies, efforts to collaborate on pre-employment transition services may be hindered. Officials with the National Technical Assistance Center on Transition (NTACT) told us that some of the state agencies for which they provided in-depth technical assistance were not working closely together. Officials from two of the three state educational agencies we interviewed said they viewed pre-employment transition services as primarily the responsibility of the VR agency. State VR officials in all three of our discussion groups said they have experienced coordination challenges, including difficulty determining each agency’s responsibilities for providing pre-employment transition services, obtaining data needed to identify and provide services to students, and determining which agency will pay for which services, among other challenges. Interagency agreements can help to address these types of issues. Federal internal controls recommend that management communicate with and obtain information to identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving defined objectives, such as those that can arise from new laws and regulations. Moreover, we found in prior work that it is important to establish ways to operate across agency boundaries, with measures such as developing common terminology and fostering open lines of communication. A lack of collaboration between state VR and educational agencies increases the risk that some students will not successfully transition from school to post-school activities. In addition, our prior work has identified lack of collaboration among and between federal agencies and state and local governments as a challenge to effective grant implementation. Interagency agreements are intended to serve as a mechanism related to collaboration practices, which include defining a common outcome, establishing joint strategies, and agreeing on roles and responsibilities of each agency. By taking additional steps, such as discussing the benefits of finalizing interagency agreements, and reminding states of existing technical assistance resources pertaining to updating and finalizing interagency agreements, Education would help raise awareness about the importance of the agreements and be better positioned to help states efficiently and effectively coordinate services to students with disabilities. Most state VR agencies (63 of 74) that responded to our survey reported that additional assistance with identifying best practices would be useful to their agencies. Similarly, state VR officials in all three of our discussion groups spoke to the need for Education to develop and disseminate best practices to help states, for example, comply with program requirements. WIOA requires Education to highlight best state practices on pre-employment transition services. Best practices may also help states address the challenges they reported facing in implementing and administering pre-employment transition services for students with disabilities, such as (1) coordinating with state educational agencies, (2) using VR resources more efficiently and effectively to help states balance providing pre-employment services with the full VR program, and (3) collecting data on services provided, and (4) updating data tracking systems. Coordinating service delivery with state educational agencies. Over half (41 of 74) of state VR agencies reported in our survey that additional assistance on coordinating with state educational agencies would be useful for them. Similarly, officials from all three state educational agencies we interviewed said they would like additional assistance on interagency collaboration. Officials with NTACT told us that some of the state agencies for which they provided in-depth technical assistance were not working closely together. Officials from two of the three state educational agencies we interviewed said they viewed pre-employment transition services as primarily the responsibility of the VR agency. State VR officials in all three of our discussion groups said they have experienced coordination challenges, including difficulty determining each agency’s responsibilities for providing pre-employment transition services, obtaining data needed to identify and provide services to students, and determining which agency will pay for which services, among other challenges. An official we interviewed from the Idaho Department of Education said it would be helpful to have more clearly defined roles, obligations, and means of sharing data between the state-level agencies. In written responses to our survey, one respondent said having examples of highly successful collaborations between a state educational agency and state VR agencies would be helpful. According to Education’s guidance, a student’s transition from school to post-school activities is a shared responsibility and coordination and collaboration between the state VR and educational agencies is essential. However, according to information Education provided with the regulations, while some have sought clarification and additional guidance in this area, Education determined that decisions on agencies’ responsibilities must be made at the state level to allow states maximum flexibility allowed under the law. In the absence of more specific guidelines for how state agencies should collaborate, best practices from other states could provide helpful examples. Balancing pre-employment transition services with VR services. Several state VR agencies in both our written survey responses and in discussion groups noted that by increasing services mandated for pre-employment transition services for students, they have had to reduce VR services to adults, which has made it difficult to balance the two programs. In issuing its final regulations, Education acknowledged that reserving funds would decrease amounts available for the full VR program, resulting in a transfer of benefits from individuals historically served by VR to students with disabilities in need of transition services. According to state VR directors with the National Council of State Agencies for the Blind (NCSAB), agencies for the blind have had to restrict VR services while also not being able to use all of the funds reserved for pre-employment transition services for students with disabilities because VR services cannot be paid with reserved funds. Most state VR agencies that completed our survey (50 of 74) reported that balancing pre-employment transition services with other vocational rehabilitation services was moderately difficult, very difficult, or extremely difficult during federal fiscal year 2017. Collecting data. Data collection was one of the top challenges identified by state VR agencies in our survey, with 48 of 74 reporting that collecting data on the provision of pre-employment transition services was moderately difficult, very difficult, or extremely difficult during fiscal year 2017. Prior to WIOA, agencies collected and reported data only on individuals who had applied and enrolled in the VR program. For pre-employment transition services, agencies now collect data on who provided and received each of the five required activities, including for individuals who have not submitted a VR application. State VR officials in two of our three discussion groups said that they have experienced challenges collecting sensitive information (such as social security numbers) for minors and collecting data on individuals for group services. Officials in one of the three discussion groups also said that these problems are particularly significant when trying to collect information on potentially eligible students for whom they do not have open VR cases. These students could include all those with an IEP and those that receive accommodations in school based on their disability, among others. Updating data tracking systems. Updating data systems was also one of the top challenges reported in our survey, and was cited as an additional administrative burden by state VR officials in our discussion groups. Specifically, 53 of 74 state VR agencies reported that it was moderately difficult, very difficult, or extremely difficult to update tracking systems to collect and report financial and service data on pre-employment transition services during fiscal year 2017. According to a state VR agency official we interviewed, updating that state’s tracking system is difficult because data collected on pre-employment transition services—such as the type of service provider and how the service was provided—do not fit well into a case management system designed for the full VR program. Updating these tracking systems also created an additional administrative burden for VR agency staff, according to officials from all three discussion groups and three of the four state agencies that we interviewed. Officials in two of our three discussion groups said that they have one or more full-time staff members doing only administrative tasks or that they have had to hire additional staff to handle data tracking. Education officials said that they plan to document and share best practices with states; however, they said the agency does not have a final written plan for managing these efforts because plans are still under discussion in light of inquiries received. Education officials said they are collecting information on state VR agencies’ practices through monitoring and they are sharing this information with WINTAC—information that could be useful for sharing best practices across states—but a comprehensive summary of states’ efforts will not be available until after Education officials conduct monitoring visits of all states by the end of fiscal year 2021. In addition, in a 2015 technical assistance circular, Education recommended that state VR agencies consult with other federal, state, and local agencies to identify best practices for providing pre-employment transition services to students and youth with a variety of disabilities. Education officials also said that they are looking for opportunities, such as webinars and conferences, to share information with states. However, Education does not have set timeframes and has not detailed the specific steps and activities for fully leveraging knowledge to address common challenges, or for finalizing and disseminating best practices. By doing so, Education would be better positioned to provide best practices information to state VR agencies to better serve students with disabilities who are transitioning from high school. Pre-employment transition services are designed to help students with disabilities begin to identify career interests and move from high school to post-secondary education or employment. Using federal funding, state VR agencies reported that they have generally enhanced their services and staff capacity and begun to coordinate with state educational agencies. As a result, state VR agencies generally reported serving an increased number of students. However, most states reported they have not used all the funds reserved for pre-employment transition services or updated interagency agreements between state VR and educational agencies. Education has developed multiple forms of guidance and made presentations, either directly or through its technical assistance centers. Education officials said they plan to issue additional guidance as needed. However, without clear timeframes for the issuance of this guidance, states do not know when information will become available to help them make decisions on allowable expenditures for pre-employment transition services. As a result, opportunities may be missed to identify and serve all students who might be eligible, and unserved students could continue to face difficulties preparing for a future of meaningful post-secondary education or employment. In addition, agreements between state VR and educational agencies can help facilitate the effective coordination of and financial responsibility for services. Finally, WIOA requires Education to highlight best state practices for implementing pre-employment transition services. Developing a written plan with specific timeframes would help Education provide states with information on best practices, such as balancing service delivery between pre-employment transition services and other VR services and collecting data that other states may have successfully addressed. We are making the following three recommendations to Education: The Secretary of Education should establish timeframes for providing states with additional information on allowable expenditures of funds reserved for pre-employment transition services. (Recommendation 1) The Secretary of Education should take additional steps to provide states assistance on updating and finalizing their interagency agreements with state educational agencies to include pre-employment transition services. These steps could include, for example, accelerating their efforts to discuss the benefits of finalizing interagency agreements, and reminding states of existing technical assistance resources pertaining to updating and finalizing interagency agreements. (Recommendation 2) The Secretary of Education should develop a written plan with specific timeframes and activities for identifying and disseminating best practices that address, as appropriate, implementation challenges for pre- employment transition services, such as those identified in this report. (Recommendation 3) We provided a draft of this report to Education for review and comment. Education’s written comments are reproduced in appendix III. Education also provided technical comments, which we incorporated into our report where appropriate. Education concurred with recommendation 1 and disagreed with recommendations 2 and 3 in the draft report. With regard to recommendation 1, Education stated that it agreed and will establish projected timeframes for providing states with additional information on allowable expenditures for the provision of pre- employment transition services. Education also stated that it intends to provide states with additional information in at least two forums before the end of calendar year 2018 and to review and analyze previous guidance provided to states on allowable expenditures. With regard to the draft report’s recommendation 2, which called for Education to identify states that have not updated and finalized their interagency agreements to include pre-employment transition services, Education stated that it disagreed, in large part, because there is no statutory provision authorizing the agency to identify such states. However, Education is taking some steps as part of its ongoing monitoring of the VR program to provide assistance to states that have not updated their interagency agreements, which is consistent with the intention of our recommendation, but more could be done. Education stated that it will continue to offer and provide technical assistance if it becomes known through the onsite monitoring of the VR program or through other means that states have not updated their interagency agreements between VR agencies and state educational agencies. It also noted that the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) and its Office of Special Education Programs will provide information related to sources of technical assistance, as appropriate, to VR agencies and state educational agencies. While these steps may be helpful, given the number of states that have not updated and finalized their agreements and the length of time Education officials say they will take to complete this round of monitoring where Education asks state VR agencies about these agreements, additional action by Education may be needed to help states more efficiently and effectively coordinate services to students with disabilities. Education also wrote that while the Rehabilitation Act requires an interagency agreement, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act does not contain a parallel requirement for state and local educational agencies with respect to the provision of pre-employment transition services or the incorporation of such discussion into the interagency agreement. In light of these differing requirements, as we state in our report, stakeholders with whom we spoke indicated it can be difficult to get state educational agencies to work with state VR agencies to update interagency agreements. Therefore, it is all the more important for Education to take additional action to engage with VR agencies regarding interagency agreements and to work closely with VR agencies as Education becomes aware of states that have not updated their agreements. Education suggested a modified recommendation that removed reference to Education identifying states that have not updated and finalized their agreements. We modified the recommendation and the report to address Education’s concerns about its authority to identify states. By taking additional steps, such as discussing the benefits of finalizing interagency agreements, and reminding states of existing technical assistance resources pertaining to updating and finalizing interagency agreements, Education would help raise awareness about the importance of the interagency agreements and be better positioned to help states efficiently and effectively coordinate services to students with disabilities. With regard to recommendation 3, Education stated that it disagreed because it is premature to develop a timeline for the dissemination of best practices. Education stated that the identification of “best” practices, meaning those that are clearly supported by a body of evidence derived from valid and reliable research findings, is still emerging as states implement the requirements. Education suggested a modified recommendation that included planning for the dissemination of best practices identified by states as they become available. Education stated in its comments that as RSA identifies best practices through its monitoring and technical assistance activities, it will, in collaboration with its Office of Special Education Programs, consider when and how best to disseminate this information to state VR and educational agencies. With regard to including specific timeframes and activities in a written plan, by detailing the specific steps Education is taking and plans to take along with the amount of time it expects them to take, Education would be better positioned to complete those steps in a timely manner and meet the statutory requirement that Education highlight best state practices and support state agencies. As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to the appropriate congressional committees and the Secretary of Education. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact Elizabeth H. Curda at (202) 512-7215 or curdae@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix IV. The objectives of this report are to examine (1) the steps states have reported taking to implement pre-employment transition services, and (2) the implementation challenges, if any, states reported facing, and how the Department of Education (Education) has addressed them. To address these objectives, we reviewed federal laws and regulations, and Education’s guidance and technical assistance documents, including circulars, policy directives, and transition guides. We also reviewed expenditure data reported by state vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies to Education for fiscal years 2015 and 2016, the most recent full years of data available. To assess the reliability of the data, we interviewed Education officials about their collection of the data and their opinion of the data’s quality, completeness, and accuracy. We also electronically tested the data for any obvious errors. We determined that the data were reliable for the purposes of our review. We interviewed representatives from the Council of State Administrators of Vocational Rehabilitation (CSAVR) and the National Council of State Agencies for the Blind. In addition, we interviewed officials from Education’s Office of Special Education and Rehabilitation Services, Rehabilitation Services Administration, Office of Special Education Programs, and the Workforce Innovation Technical Assistance Center and National Technical Assistance Center on Transition—two technical assistance centers funded by Education. To address both of the objectives, we conducted a survey of all 79 state VR agencies from October through December 2017. Seventy-four of the 79 agencies (94 percent) responded. The survey questionnaire included open-ended and closed-ended questions about agencies’ efforts to train staff, update interagency agreements, expand services to students with disabilities, and other issues. We took steps to minimize the potential errors that may be introduced by the practical difficulties of conducting any survey. Because we selected the entire population of VR agencies for our survey, our estimates are not subject to sampling error. We conducted pretests of the draft questionnaire with three agencies in the population and made revisions to reduce the possibility of measurement error from differences in how questions were interpreted and the sources of information available to respondents. We reviewed state officials’ submitted survey responses and conducted follow-up, as necessary, to determine that their responses were complete, reasonable, and sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. A second independent analyst checked the accuracy of all computer analyses we performed to minimize the likelihood of errors in data processing. We made multiple follow-up attempts during the survey with agencies that had not yet responded. The five agencies that did not respond had smaller values, on average, on three characteristics related to size, than those that did respond. The nonrespondents tended to be smaller than respondent agencies. The sums totals for each of these three characteristics across the five nonresponding agencies comprised less than 1 percent of the totals for the population, suggesting a lower possibility of material error in our results from nonresponse. For more in-depth information on both of the objectives, we conducted interviews and held discussion groups. We conducted interviews with officials in Idaho, Illinois, and Maryland. For each state, we interviewed state VR officials and state educational agency officials. We selected these states for variety using the following criteria: size of the special education population (large, medium, and small); state agency organization, for example, whether the VR agency was organized under the state’s educational or other department; and whether the state had a second agency for serving individuals who are blind or visually impaired. We convened three discussion groups with state VR agency directors or their designated officials, with a total of 39 participants from 29 separate agencies (10 to 12 agencies represented per discussion group). These discussion groups took place during a conference of state VR directors in November 2017 in Greenville, South Carolina. To select participants, we worked with the conference organizer, CSAVR, to send invitations for our discussion groups to all conference attendees. We additionally included a question in our survey asking respondents whether they would like to participate in discussion groups at the conference, and contacted those who responded affirmatively via phone and email. We moderated each discussion to keep participants focused on the specified issues within discussion timeframes. To assess Education’s efforts to address state VR agencies’ challenges in providing pre-employment transition services, we applied standards for internal control in the federal government. Specifically, we applied principle 15 related to communicating with external parties. In addition, regarding Education’s assistance to state VR agencies’ efforts to update interagency agreements with state educational agencies, we also applied key considerations for implementing interagency collaborative mechanisms that we have previously identified. We conducted this performance audit from February 2017 to September 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Elizabeth H. Curda, (202) 512-7215 or curdae@gao.gov.

GAO was asked to review how states were implementing these services. This report examines (1) steps states reported taking to implement pre-employment transition services, and (2) implementation challenges states reported and how Education has addressed them. GAO reviewed documents and funding data from Education, and federal laws and regulations; surveyed all 79 state VR agencies (74 responded); held discussion groups with representatives of 29 state VR agencies; and interviewed officials from Education and three states (Idaho, Illinois, and Maryland) GAO selected for variety in size and type of agencies, among other factors. Of the 74 state vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies that responded to GAO's survey, most reported expanding services to help students with disabilities transition from school to work as required under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), enacted in July 2014. Most state agencies reported serving more students and providing work-based learning experiences and other activities, referred to as pre-employment transition services (see figure). State VR agencies reported two key challenges with implementing pre-employment transition services for students as required by WIOA. Spending reserved funds : States reported spending about $357 million out of the $465 million reserved for these services in fiscal year 2016. Education officials said that states had difficulty determining what expenditures were allowable, and some state officials said they would like more detailed information from Education. Education officials said they plan to clarify guidance but have no timeframe for providing further information, which would help states to better plan their use of reserved funds. Finalizing interagency agreements : Fewer than half the state VR agencies that responded to GAO's survey (34 of 74) reported updating their interagency agreement with their state's educational agency. Interagency agreements can help promote collaboration by, for example, establishing roles and responsibilities of each agency. Although Education offers technical assistance on interagency agreements, without increased efforts to raise awareness about the importance of these agreements and provide assistance to states where needed, Education may miss opportunities to help state VR and educational agencies efficiently and effectively coordinate services. In addition, WIOA requires Education to highlight best state practices, and most VR agencies responding to GAO's survey (63 of 74) reported this would be useful. Education does not have a written plan or timeframe for identifying and disseminating best practices. As a result, Education may miss opportunities to help more students with disabilities successfully transition from school to work. GAO is recommending that Education (1) establish timeframes for providing additional information on allowable expenditures, (2) take additional steps to assist states that have not updated and finalized their interagency agreements, and (3) develop a written plan with specific timeframes and activities for identifying and disseminating best practices. Education agreed with the first recommendation and disagreed with the other two. GAO revised the second recommendation and maintains that specific information is needed for the third, as discussed in the report.""]","9550","gov_report","en","None","c325a40777333d0e9c79489ab40a509f45e261d2054ea3d7","Summary:","gov_report","532","\n\nThe Rehabilitation Act of 1977773, as amended by WIOA, authorizes aims to provide a number of grant programs to support employment and independent living for individuals with disabilities.

"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nMedicare is a federal program that pays for covered health care services of qualified beneficiaries. It was established in 1965 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide health insurance to individuals 65 and older, and has been expanded over the years to include permanently disabled individuals under 65. The program is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Medicare consists of four distinct parts: Part A (Hospital Insurance, or HI) covers inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing care, hospice care, and some home health services. The HI trust fund is mainly funded by a dedicated payroll tax of 2.9% of earnings, shared equally between employers and workers. Since 2013, workers with income of more than $200,000 per year for single tax filers (or more than $250,000 for joint tax filers) pay an additional 0.9% on income over those amounts. Part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance, or SMI) covers physician services, outpatient services, and some home health and preventive services. The SMI trust fund is funded through beneficiary premiums (set at 25% of estimated program costs for the aged) and general revenues (the remaining amount, approximately 75%). Part C (Medicare Advantage, or MA) is a private plan option for beneficiaries that covers all Parts A and B services, except hospice. Individuals choosing to enroll in Part C must also enroll in Part B. Part C is funded through the HI and SMI trust funds. Part D covers outpatient prescription drug benefits. Funding is included in the SMI trust fund and is financed through beneficiary premiums, general revenues, and state transfer payments. Medicare serves approximately one in six Americans and virtually all of the population aged 65 and older. In 2019, the program will cover an estimated 61 million persons (52 million aged and 9 million disabled). The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that total Medicare spending in 2019 will be about $772 billion; of this amount, approximately $749 billion will be spent on benefits. About 28% of Medicare benefit spending is for hospital inpatient and hospital outpatient services (see Figure 1 ). CBO also estimates that federal Medicare spending (after deduction of beneficiary premiums and other offsetting receipts) will be about $637 billion in 2019, accounting for about 14% of total federal spending and 3% of GDP. Medicare is required to pay for all covered services provided to eligible persons, so long as specific criteria are met. Spending under the program (except for a portion of administrative costs) is considered mandatory spending and is not subject to the appropriations process. Medicare is expected to be a high-priority issue in the current Congress. The program has a significant impact on beneficiaries and other stakeholders as well as on the economy in general through its coverage of important health care benefits for the aged and disabled, the payment of premiums and other cost sharing by those beneficiaries, its payments to providers who supply those health care services, and its interaction with other insurance coverage. Projections of future Medicare expenditures and funding indicate that the program will place increasing financial demands on the federal budget and on beneficiaries. In response to these concerns, Congress may consider a range of Medicare reform options, from making changes within the current structure, including modifying provider payments and revising existing oversight and regulatory mechanisms, to restructuring the entire program. The committees of jurisdiction for the mandatory spending (benefits) portion of Medicare are the Senate Committee on Finance, the House Committee on Ways and Means, and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations have jurisdiction over the discretionary spending used to administer and oversee the program. Medicare was enacted in 1965 (P.L. 89-97) in response to the concern that only about half of the nation's seniors had health insurance, and most of those had coverage only for inpatient hospital costs. The new program, which became effective July 1, 1966, included Part A coverage for hospital and posthospital services and Part B coverage for doctors and other medical services. As is the case for the Social Security program, Part A is financed by payroll taxes levied on current workers and their employers; persons must pay into the system for 40 quarters to become entitled to premium-free benefits. Medicare Part B is voluntary, with a monthly premium required of beneficiaries who choose to enroll. Payments to health care providers under both Part A and Part B were originally based on the most common form of payment at the time, namely ""reasonable costs"" for hospital and other institutional services or ""usual, customary and reasonable charges"" for physicians and other medical services. Medicare is considered a social insurance program and is the second-largest such federal program, after Social Security. The 1965 law also established Medicaid, the federal/state health insurance program for the poor; this was an expansion of previous welfare-based assistance programs. Some low-income individuals qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid. In the ensuing years, Medicare has undergone considerable change. P.L. 92-603, enacted in 1972, expanded program coverage to certain individuals under 65 (the disabled and persons with end-stage renal disease (ESRD)), and introduced managed care into Medicare by allowing private insurance entities to provide Medicare benefits in exchange for a monthly capitated payment. This law also began to place limitations on the definitions of reasonable costs and charges in order to gain some control over program spending which, even initially, exceeded original projections. During the 1980s and 1990s, a number of laws were enacted that included provisions designed to further stem the rapid increase in program spending through modifications to the way payments to providers were determined, and to postpone the insolvency of the Medicare Part A trust fund. This was typically achieved through tightening rules governing payments to providers of services and limiting the annual updates in such payments. The program moved from payments based on reasonable costs and reasonable charges to payment systems under which a predetermined payment amount was established for a specified unit of service. At the same time, beneficiaries were given expanded options to obtain covered services through private managed care arrangements, typically health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Most Medicare payment provisions were incorporated into larger budget reconciliation bills designed to control overall federal spending. This effort culminated in the enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA 97; P.L. 105-33 ). This law slowed the rate of growth in payments to providers and established new payment systems for certain categories of providers, including establishing the sustainable growth rate (SGR) methodology for determining the annual update to Medicare physician payments. It also established the Medicare+Choice program, which expanded private plan options for beneficiaries and changed the way most of these plans were paid. BBA 97 further expanded preventive services covered by the program. Subsequently, Congress became concerned that the BBA 97 cuts in payments to providers were somewhat larger than originally anticipated. Therefore, legislation was enacted in both 1999 (Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999, or BBRA; P.L. 106-113 ) and 2000 (Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000, or BIPA; P.L. 106-554 ) to mitigate the impact of BBA 97 on providers. In 2003, Congress enacted the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA; P.L. 108-173 ), which included a major benefit expansion and placed increasing emphasis on the private sector to deliver and manage benefits. The MMA included provisions that (1) created a new voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit to be administered by private entities; (2) replaced the Medicare+Choice program with the Medicare Advantage (MA) program and raised payments to plans in order to increase their availability for beneficiaries; (3) introduced the concept of income testing into Medicare, with higher-income persons paying larger Part B premiums beginning in 2007; (4) modified some provider payment rules; (5) expanded covered preventive services; and (6) created a specific process for overall program review if general revenue spending exceeded a specified threshold. During the 109 th Congress, two laws were enacted that incorporated minor modifications to Medicare's payment rules. These were the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA; P.L. 109-171 ) and the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (TRHCA; P.L. 109-432 ). In the 110 th Congress, additional changes were incorporated in the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 (MMSEA; P.L. 110-173 ) and the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA; P.L. 110-275 ). In the 111 th Congress, comprehensive health reform legislation was enacted that, among other things, made statutory changes to the Medicare program. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148 ), enacted on March 23, 2010, included numerous provisions affecting Medicare payments, payment rules, covered benefits, and the delivery of care. The Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the Reconciliation Act, or HCERA; P.L. 111-152 ), enacted on March 30, 2010, made changes to a number of Medicare-related provisions in the ACA and added several new provisions. Included in the ACA, as amended, are provisions that (1) constrain Medicare's annual payment increases for certain providers; (2) change payment rates in the MA program so that they more closely resemble those in fee-for-service; (3) reduce payments to hospitals that serve a large number of low-income patients; (4) create an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to make recommendations to adjust Medicare payment rates; (5) phase out the Part D prescription drug benefit ""doughnut hole""; (6) increase resources and enhance activities to prevent fraud and abuse; and (7) provide incentives to increase the quality and efficiency of care, such as creating value-based purchasing programs for certain types of providers, allowing accountable care organizations (ACOs) that meet certain quality and efficiency standards to share in the savings, creating a voluntary pilot program that bundles payments for physician, hospital, and post-acute care services, and adjusting payments to hospitals for readmissions related to certain potentially preventable conditions. In the 112 th and 113 th Congresses, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA; P.L. 112-240 ), the Continuing Appropriations Resolution of 2014 ( P.L. 113-67 ), and the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA; P.L. 113-93 ) primarily made short-term modifications to physician payment updates and payment adjustments for certain types of providers. PAMA also established a new skilled nursing facility (SNF) value-based purchasing program and a new system for determining payments for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests. The Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (IMPACT; P.L. 113-185 ) required that post-acute care providers—defined in the law as long-term care hospitals (LTCHs), inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs), SNFs, and home health agencies (HHAs)—report standardized patient assessment data and data on quality measures and resource use. IMPACT also modified the annual update to the hospice aggregate payment cap and required that hospices be reviewed every three years to ensure that they are compliant with existing regulations related to patient health and safety and quality of care. In the 114 th Congress, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA; P.L. 114-10 ) repealed the SGR formula for calculating updates to Medicare payment rates to physicians and other practitioners and established an alternative set of methods for determining the annual updates . MACRA also introduced alternatives to the current fee-for-service (FFS) based physician payments by creating a new merit-based incentive payment system (MIPS) and put in place processes for developing, evaluating, and adopting alternative payment models (APMs). Additionally, MACRA reduced updates to hospital and post-acute care provider payments, extended several expiring provider payment adjustments, made adjustments to income-related premiums in Parts B and D, and prohibited using Social Security numbers on beneficiaries' Medicare cards. Among other changes, the Increasing Choice, Access, and Quality in Health Care for Americans Act (Division C of the 21 st Century Cures Act; P.L. 114-255 ) made adjustments to LTCH reimbursement and modified the average length of stay criteria, which determines whether a hospital qualifies as an LTCH. It also delayed payment reductions and required the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to make changes to how payments are determined for certain durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS). Lastly, it allowed beneficiaries with ESRD to enroll in MA beginning January 1, 2021. In the 115 th Congress, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 18; P.L. 115-123 ) made a number of changes to federal health care programs, including Medicare. For example, BBA 18 included provisions designed to expand care for beneficiaries with chronic health conditions, such as promoting team-based care by providers, increasing the use of telehealth services, and expanding certain MA supplemental benefits. In addition, BBA 18 extended for five years a number of existing Medicare provisions that were set to expire (or that had temporarily expired), including the Medicare dependent hospital program and add-on payments for low-volume hospitals, rural home health services, and certain ambulance services. BBA 18 also specified payment updates for the Medicare physician fee schedule, SNFs, and home health services; reduced payments for non-emergency ambulance transports; and required modification of the home health prospective payment system starting in 2020. In addition, the act provided for indefinite authority for MA special needs plans, repealed limits on outpatient therapy services, and eliminated the IPAB. Starting in 2019, the act will require that pharmaceutical manufacturers participating in Medicare Part D provide a larger discount on brand-name drugs purchased by enrollees in the coverage gap and will create a new high-income premium category under Parts B and D. Most persons aged 65 or older are automatically entitled to premium-free Part A because they or their spouse paid Medicare payroll taxes for at least 40 quarters (about 10 years) on earnings covered by either the Social Security or the Railroad Retirement systems. Persons under the age of 65 who receive cash disability benefits from Social Security or the Railroad Retirement systems for at least 24 months are also entitled to Part A. (Since there is a five-month waiting period for cash payments, the Medicare waiting period is effectively 29 months.) The 24-month waiting period is waived for persons with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, ""Lou Gehrig's disease""). Individuals of any age with ESRD who receive dialysis on a regular basis or a kidney transplant are generally eligible for Medicare. Medicare coverage for individuals with ESRD usually starts the first day of the fourth month of dialysis treatments. In addition, individuals with one or more specified lung diseases or types of cancer who lived for six months during a certain period prior to diagnosis in an area subject to a public health emergency declaration by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as of June 17, 2009, are also deemed entitled to benefits under Part A and eligible to enroll in Part B. Persons over the age of 65 who are not entitled to premium-free Part A may obtain coverage by paying a monthly premium ($437 in 2019) or, for persons with at least 30 quarters of covered employment, a reduced monthly premium ($240 in 2019). In addition, disabled persons who lose their cash benefits solely because of higher earnings, and subsequently lose their extended Medicare coverage, may continue their Medicare enrollment by paying a premium, subject to limitations. Generally, enrollment in Medicare Part B is voluntary. All persons entitled to Part A (and persons over the age of 65 who are not entitled to premium-free Part A) may enroll in Part B by paying a monthly premium. In 2019, the monthly premium is $135.50; however, about 3.5% of Part B enrollees pay less, due to a ""hold-harmless"" provision in the Social Security Act. Since 2007, higher-income Part B enrollees pay higher premiums. (See "" Part B Financing ."") Although enrollment in Part B is voluntary for most individuals, in most cases, those who enroll in Part A by paying a premium also must enroll in Part B. Additionally, ESRD beneficiaries and Medicare Advantage enrollees (discussed below) also must enroll in Part B. Together, Parts A and B of Medicare comprise ""original Medicare,"" which covers benefits on a fee-for-service basis. Beneficiaries have another option for coverage through private plans, called the Medicare Advantage (MA or Part C) program. When beneficiaries first become eligible for Medicare, they may choose either original Medicare or they may enroll in a private MA plan. Each fall, there is an annual open enrollment period during which time Medicare beneficiaries may choose a different MA plan, or leave or join the MA program. Beneficiaries are to receive information about their options to help them make informed decisions. In 2019, the annual open enrollment period runs from October 15 to December 7 for plan choices starting the following January. Since 2012, MA plans with a 5-star quality rating have been allowed to enroll Medicare beneficiaries who are either in traditional Medicare or in an MA plan with a lower quality rating at any time. Finally, each individual enrolled in either Part A or Part B is also entitled to obtain qualified prescription drug coverage through enrollment in a Part D prescription drug plan. Similar to Part B, enrollment in Part D is voluntary and the beneficiary pays a monthly premium. Since 2011, some higher-income enrollees pay higher premiums, similar to enrollees in Part B. Generally, beneficiaries enrolled in an MA plan providing qualified prescription drug coverage (MA-PD plan) must obtain their prescription drug coverage through that plan. In general, individuals who do not enroll in Part B or Part D during an initial enrollment period (when they first become eligible for Medicare) must pay a permanent penalty of increased monthly premiums if they choose to enroll at a later date. Individuals who do not enroll in Part B during their initial enrollment period may enroll only during the annual general enrollment period, which occurs from January 1 to March 31 each year. Coverage begins the following July 1. However, the law waives the Part B late enrollment penalty for current workers who have primary coverage through their own or a spouse's employer-sponsored plan. These individuals have a special enrollment period once their employment ends; as long as they enroll in Part B during this time, they will not be subject to penalty. Individuals who do not enroll in Part D during their initial enrollment period may enroll during the annual open enrollment period, which corresponds with the Part C annual enrollment period—from October 15 to December 7, with coverage effective the following January. Individuals are not subject to the Part D penalty if they have maintained ""creditable"" drug coverage through another source, such as retiree health coverage offered by a former employer or union. However, once employees retire or have no access to ""creditable"" Part D coverage, a penalty will apply unless they sign up for coverage during a special enrollment period. Finally, for persons who qualify for the low-income subsidy for Part D, the delayed-enrollment penalty does not apply. Medicare Parts A, B, and D each cover different services, with Part C providing a private plan alternative for all Medicare services covered under Parts A and B, except hospice. The Parts A-D covered services are described below, along with a description of Medicare's payments. Part A provides coverage for inpatient hospital services, posthospital skilled nursing facility (SNF) services, hospice care, and some home health services, subject to certain conditions and limitations. Approximately 20% of fee-for-service enrollees use Part A services during a year. Medicare inpatient hospital services include (1) bed and board; (2) nursing services; (3) use of hospital facilities; (4) drugs, biologics, supplies, appliances, and equipment; and (5) diagnostic and therapeutic items and services. (Physicians' services provided during an inpatient stay are paid under the physician fee schedule and discussed below in the "" Physicians and Nonphysician Practitioner Services "" section.) Coverage for inpatient services is linked to an individual's benefit period or ""spell of illness"" (defined as beginning on the day a patient enters a hospital and ending when he or she has not been in a hospital or skilled nursing facility for 60 days). An individual admitted to a hospital more than 60 days after the last discharge from a hospital or SNF begins a new benefit period. Coverage in each benefit period is subject to the following conditions: Days 1-60. Beneficiary pays a deductible ($1,364 in 2019). Days 61-90. Beneficiary pays a daily co-payment charge ($341 in 2019). Days 91-150. After 90 days, the beneficiary may draw on one or more of 60 lifetime reserve days, provided they have not been previously used. (Each of the 60 lifetime reserve days can be used only once during an individual's lifetime.) For lifetime reserve days, the beneficiary pays a daily co-payment charge ($682 in 2019); otherwise the beneficiary pays all costs. Days 151 and over. Beneficiary pays for all costs for these days. Inpatient mental health care in a psychiatric facility is limited to 190 days during a patient's lifetime. Cost sharing is structured similarly to that for stays in a general hospital (above). Medicare makes payments to most acute care hospitals under the inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS), using a prospectively determined amount for each discharge. Medicare's payments to hospitals is the product of two components: (1) a discharge payment amount adjusted by a wage index for the area where the hospital is located or where it has been reclassified, and (2) the weight associated with the Medicare severity-diagnosis related group (MS-DRG) to which the patient is assigned. This weight reflects the relative costliness of the average patient in that MS-DRG, which is revised annually, generally effective October 1 st of each year. Additional payments are made to hospitals for cases with extraordinary costs (outliers), for indirect costs incurred by teaching hospitals for graduate medical education, and to disproportionate share hospitals (DSH) which provide a certain volume of care to low-income patients. Additional payments may also be made for qualified new technologies that have been approved for special add-on payments. Medicare also makes payments outside the IPPS system for direct costs associated with graduate medical education (GME) for hospital residents, subject to certain limits. In addition, Medicare pays hospitals for 65% of the allowable costs associated with beneficiaries' unpaid deductible and co-payment amounts as well as for the costs for certain other services. IPPS payments may be reduced by certain quality-related programs based on a hospital's quality performance. These quality-related programs include the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, the Hospital-Acquired Condition Reduction Program, and the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program. Further, hospitals may receive Medicare payment reductions for failing to demonstrate meaningful use of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Additional payment adjustments or special treatment under the IPPS may apply for hospitals meeting one of the following designations: (1) sole community hospitals (SCHs), (2) Medicare dependent hospitals, (3) rural referral centers, and (4) low-volume hospitals. Certain hospitals or distinct hospital units are exempt from IPPS and paid on an alternative basis, including (1) inpatient rehabilitation facilities, (2) long-term care hospitals, (3) psychiatric facilities including hospitals and distinct part units, (4) children's hospitals, (5) cancer hospitals, and (6) critical access hospitals. Medicare covers up to 100 days of posthospital care for persons needing skilled nursing or rehabilitation services on a daily basis. The SNF stay must be preceded by an inpatient hospital stay of at least 3 consecutive calendar days, and the transfer to the SNF typically must occur within 30 days of the hospital discharge. Medicare requires SNFs to provide services for a condition the beneficiary was receiving treatment for during his or her qualifying hospital stay (or for an additional condition that arose while in the SNF). There is no beneficiary cost sharing for the first 20 days of a Medicare-covered SNF stay. For days 21 to 100, beneficiaries are subject to daily co-payment charges ($170.50 in 2019). The 100-day limit begins again with a new spell of illness. SNF services are paid under a prospective payment system (PPS), which is based on a per diem urban or rural base payment rate, adjusted for case mix (average severity of illness) and area wages. The per diem rate generally covers all services, including room and board, provided to the patient that day. The case-mix adjustment is made using the resource utilization groups (RUGs) classification system, which uses patient assessments to assign a beneficiary to one of 66 groups that reflect the beneficiary's expected use of services. Patient assessments are done at various times during a patient's stay and a beneficiary's designated RUG category can change with changes in the beneficiary's condition. Extra payments are not made for extraordinarily costly cases (""outliers""). The Medicare hospice benefit covers services designed to provide palliative care and management of a terminal illness; the benefit includes drugs and medical and support services. These services are provided to Medicare beneficiaries with a life expectancy of six months or less for two 90-day periods, followed by an unlimited number of 60-day periods. The individual's attending physician and the hospice physician must certify the need for the first benefit period, but only the hospice physician needs to recertify for subsequent periods. Since January 1, 2011, a hospice physician or nurse practitioner must have a face-to-face encounter with the individual to determine continued eligibility prior to the 180 th day recertification, and for each subsequent recertification. Hospice care is provided in lieu of most other Medicare services related to the curative treatment of the terminal illness. Beneficiaries electing hospice care from a hospice program may receive curative services for illnesses or injuries unrelated to their terminal illness, and they may disenroll from the hospice at any time. Nominal cost sharing is required for drugs and respite care. Payment for hospice care is based on one of four prospectively determined rates (which correspond to four different levels of care) for each day a beneficiary is under the care of the hospice. The four rate categories are routine home care, continuous home care, inpatient respite care, and general inpatient care. Payment rates are adjusted to reflect differences in area wage levels, using the hospital wage index. Payments to a hospice are limited by two caps; the first limits the number of days of inpatient care to 20% or less of total patient care days, and the second limits the average annual payment per beneficiary. Home health services and services for individuals with end-stage renal disease are covered under both Parts A and B of Medicare. Medicare covers visits by participating home health agencies for beneficiaries who (1) are confined to home and (2) need either skilled nursing care on an intermittent basis or physical or speech language therapy. After establishing such eligibility, the continuing need for occupational therapy services may extend the eligibility period. Covered services include part-time or intermittent nursing care, physical or occupational therapy or speech language pathology services, medical social services, home health aide services, and medical supplies and durable medical equipment. The services must be provided under a plan of care established by a physician, and the plan must be reviewed by the physician at least every 60 days. There is no beneficiary cost sharing for home health services (though some other Part B services provided in connection with the visit, such as durable medical equipment, may be subject to cost-sharing charges). Home health services are covered under both Medicare Parts A and B. There are special eligibility requirements and benefit limits for home health services furnished under Part A to beneficiaries who are enrolled in both Parts A and B. For such a beneficiary, Part A pays for only postinstitutional home health services furnished for up to 100 visits during a spell of illness, while Part B covers any medically necessary home health services that exceed the 100-visit limit, as well as medically necessary home health services that do not qualify as ""postinstitutional."" For beneficiaries enrolled in only Part A or only Part B, the requirements described above do not apply. Part A or Part B, as applicable, covers all medically necessary episodes of home health care, without a visit limit, regardless of whether the episode follows a hospitalization. Regardless of whether the beneficiary is enrolled in Part A only, in Part B only, or in both parts, the scope of the Medicare home health benefit is the same, Medicare's payments to HHAs are calculated using the same methods, and beneficiaries have no cost-sharing. Home health services are paid under a home health PPS, based on 60-day episodes of care; a patient may have an unlimited number of episodes. The physician's certification of an initial 60-day episode of home health must be supported by a face-to-face encounter with the patient related to the primary reason that the patient needs home health services. Under the PPS, for episodes with five or greater visits, a nationwide base payment amount is adjusted by differences in wages (using the hospital wage index). This amount is then adjusted for case mix using the applicable Home Health Resource Group (HHRG) to which the beneficiary has been assigned. The HHRG applicable to a beneficiary is determined following an assessment of the patient's condition and care needs using the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS); there are 153 HHRGs. For episodes with four or fewer visits, the PPS reimburses the provider for each visit performed. Further payment adjustments may be made for services provided in rural areas, outlier visits (for extremely costly patients), a partial episode for beneficiaries that have an intervening event during their episode, or an agency's failure to submit quality data to CMS. Since January 1, 2016, home health agencies in nine states are being reimbursed under a home health value-based purchasing (HHVBP) model. These home health agencies can receive increased or decreased home health reimbursements depending on their performance across certain quality measures. Individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are eligible for all services covered under Parts A and B. Kidney transplantation services, to the extent they are inpatient hospital services, are subject to the inpatient hospital PPS and are reimbursed by both Parts A and B. However, kidney acquisition costs are paid on a reasonable cost basis under Part A. Dialysis treatments, when an individual is admitted to a hospital, are covered under Part A. Part B covers their dialysis services, drugs, biologicals (including erythropoiesis stimulating agents used in treating anemia as a result of ESRD), diagnostic laboratory tests, and other items and services furnished to individuals for the treatment of ESRD. In effect since January 1, 2011, the ESRD prospective payment system (PPS) makes no payment distinction as to the site where renal dialysis services are provided. With the implementation of the ESRD PPS, Medicare dialysis payments provide a single ""bundled"" payment for Medicare renal dialysis services that includes (1) items and services included in the former payment system's base rate as of December 31, 2010; (2) erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) for the treatment of ESRD; (3) other drugs and biologicals for which payment was made separately (before bundling); and (4) diagnostic laboratory tests and other items and services furnished to individuals for the treatment of ESRD. The system is case-mix adjusted based on factors such as patient weight, body mass index, comorbidities, length of time on dialysis, age, race, ethnicity, and other appropriate factors as determined by the Secretary. Under the ESRD Quality Incentive Program, dialysis facilities that fail to meet certain performance standards receive reduced payments. Medicare Part B covers physicians' services, outpatient hospital services, durable medical equipment, and other medical services. Initially, over 98% of the eligible population voluntarily enrolled in Part B, but in recent years the percentage has fallen to about 91%. About 89% of enrollees in original (FFS) Medicare use Part B services during a year. The program generally pays 80% of the approved amount (most commonly, a fee schedule or other predetermined amount) for covered services in excess of the annual deductible ($185 in 2019). The beneficiary is liable for the remaining 20%. Most providers and practitioners are subject to limits on amounts they can bill beneficiaries for covered services. For example, physicians and some other practitioners may choose whether or not to accept ""assignment"" on a claim. When a physician signs a binding agreement to accept assignment for all Medicare patients, the physician accepts the Medicare payment amount as payment in full and can bill the beneficiary only the 20% coinsurance plus any unmet deductible. The physician agrees to accept assignment on all Medicare claims in a given year and is referred to as a ""participating physician."" There are several advantages to being a participating provider, including higher payment under the Medicare fee schedule, a lower beneficiary co-payment, and automatic forwarding of Medigap claims. Physicians who do not agree to accept assignment on all Medicare claims in a given year are referred to as nonparticipating physicians. Nonparticipating physicians may or may not accept assignment for a given service. If they do not, they may charge beneficiaries more than the fee schedule amount on nonassigned claims; however, these ""balance billing"" charges are subject to certain limits. Alternatively, physicians may choose not to accept any Medicare payment and enter into private contracts with their patients where no Medicare restrictions on payment or balance billing apply; however, this requires that physicians ""opt out"" of Medicare for two years. For some providers, such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants, assignment is mandatory; these providers can only bill the beneficiary the 20% coinsurance and any unmet deductible. For other Part B services, such as durable medical equipment, assignment is optional; for these services, applicable providers may bill beneficiaries for amounts above Medicare's recognized payment level and may do so without limit. Medicare Part B covers medically necessary physician services and medical services provided by some nonphysician practitioners. Covered nonphysician practitioner services include, but are not limited to, those provided by physician assistants, nurse practitioners, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and clinical social workers. Certain limitations apply for services provided by chiropractors and podiatrists. Beneficiary cost sharing is typically 20% of the approved amount, although most preventive services require no coinsurance from the beneficiary. A number of Part B services are paid under the Medicare physician fee schedule (MPFS), including services of physicians, nonphysician practitioners, and therapists. There are over 7,000 service codes under the MPFS. The fee schedule assigns relative values to each service code. These relative values reflect physician work (based on time, skill, and intensity involved), practice expenses (e.g., overhead and nonphysician labor), and malpractice expenses. The relative values are adjusted for geographic variations in the costs of practicing medicine. These geographically adjusted relative values are converted into a dollar payment amount by a national conversion factor. Annual updates to payments are determined through changes in the conversion factor. MACRA made several fundamental changes to how Medicare pays for physician and practitioner services by (1) changing the methodology for determining the annual updates to the conversion factor, (2) establishing a merit-based incentive payment system (MIPS) to consolidate and replace several existing incentive programs and to apply value and quality adjustments to the MPFS, and (3) establishing the development of, and participation in, alternative payment models (APMs). Prior to MACRA, the SGR system, which had been in place since BBA 97, tied annual updates to the Medicare fee schedule to cumulative Part B expenditure targets. MACRA repealed the SGR methodology, established annual fee schedule updates in the short term, and put in place a new method for determining updates thereafter. As a result of the MACRA changes, the update to physician payments under the MPFS was 0% from January 2015 through June 2015; for the remainder of that year—July 2015 through December 2015—the payments were increased by 0.5%. In each of the next four years, 2016 through 2019, the payments were to increase by 0.5% each year; however, the BBA 18 reduced the 2019 update to 0.25%. For the next six years, from 2020 through 2025, the payment update will be 0%. In addition to changes to the annual update, MACRA established two pathways for payment reform, collectively referred to as the Quality Payment Program (QPP). Medicare payment to all physicians and other practitioners will be determined by which conditions of the QPP, either MIPS or APM, the participant satisfies. The MIPS is a new program that remains based on FFS rates but combines four categories of performance measures (quality of care, cost/resource use, clinical practice improvement activities, and promoting interoperability) into a single adjustment to the base MPFS payment. Following several years of data collection and feedback on measures, the MIPS adjustments will affect actual payments for the first time in 2019. In contrast, qualified advanced APMs are intended to be alternatives to FFS, incorporating new approaches to paying for medical care that reward quality and efficiency while de-emphasizing the number of services billed (volume of care). Proposed advanced APMs are evaluated by an ad hoc committee (the Physician-Focused Payment Models Technical Advisory Committee), which provides comments and recommendations to the Secretary as to whether new payment models meet the criteria of APMs. For 2019, there are 13 advanced APMs under the QPP, though not all are available to all physicians and practitioners, as some are restricted to certain special services (e.g., oncology care, joint replacement) or geographic locations (e.g., Vermont's Medicare ACO Initiative, Maryland's Total Cost of Care Model). MACRA established incentives to make APMs more attractive than MIPS. First, qualifying participants in advanced APMs are eligible for an annual prepaid bonus (paid 2019-2024). Second, beginning in 2026, there will be two update factors, one for items and services furnished by a participant in an advanced APM and another for those electing to remain in the modified FFS payment system (MIPS) that do not participate in an advanced APM. The update factor for the advanced APM participants will be 0.75%, and the update factor for MIPS will be 0.25%, causing a difference between the payment levels that will grow over time. Medicare covers medically necessary outpatient physical and occupational therapy and speech-language pathology services. Beginning in 1997 and for many years subsequently but intermittently, beneficiaries faced limits ( therapy caps ) on how much Medicare would pay for outpatient therapy services in a calendar year. BBA 18 permanently repealed the outpatient therapy caps beginning January 1, 2018, and established a requirement that therapy services exceeding $3,000 would trigger a manual medical review (MMR) of the medical necessity of these services, in years 2018-2028. Beginning with 2029, the annual MMR threshold limit is to be increased by the percentage increase in the MEI, and it is to be applied separately for (1) physical therapy services and speech-language pathology services combined and (2) occupational therapy services. Medicare statute prohibits payments for covered items and services that are ""not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member,"" which would effectively exclude the coverage of preventive and screening services. However, Congress has explicitly added and expanded Medicare coverage for a number of such services through legislation, including through MMA, MIPPA, and ACA. Under current law, if a preventive service is recommended for use by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF, an independent evidence-review panel) and Medicare covers the service, all cost sharing must be waived. Also, the Secretary may add coverage of a USPSTF-recommended service that is not already covered. Coverage for preventive and screening services currently includes, among other services, (1) a ""welcome to Medicare"" physical exam during the first year of enrollment in Part B and an annual visit and prevention plan thereafter; (2) flu vaccine (annual), pneumococcal vaccine, and hepatitis B vaccine (for persons at high risk); (3) screening tests for breast, cervical, prostate, and colorectal cancers; (4) screening for other conditions such as depression, alcohol misuse, heart disease, glaucoma, and osteoporosis; and (5) intensive behavioral therapy for heart disease and for obesity. Payments for these services are provided under the physician fee schedule and/or the clinical laboratory fee schedule. Part B covers outpatient clinical laboratory tests, such as certain blood tests, urinalysis, and some screening tests, provided by Medicare-participating laboratories. These services may be furnished by labs located in hospitals and physician offices, as well as by independent labs. Beneficiaries have no co-payments or deductibles for covered clinical lab services. From 1984 until recently, payments for outpatient clinical laboratory services were made on the basis of the Medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule (CLFS), which set payment amounts as the lesser of the amount billed, the local fee for a geographic area, or a national limit amount. Most clinical lab services were paid at the national limit amount. The national limits were set at a percentage (74%) of the median of all local fee schedule amounts for each laboratory test code; therefore, fee schedule amounts may differ by region. In general, annual increases in clinical lab fees have been based on the percentage change in the CPI-U. However, since 1987, Congress has specified lower updates. Beginning in 2014, with certain exceptions, laboratory tests provided in hospital outpatient departments are no longer paid separately under the CLFS and are instead included in the OPPS payments. PAMA introduced a new method for determining clinical laboratory payments and required CMS to base Medicare CLFS reimbursement on reported private insurance payment amounts. Medicare has been using weighted median private insurer rates to calculate Medicare payment rates for laboratory tests paid under the CLFS since January 1, 2018. These payment rates are national and do not vary by geographic area. Part B also covers diagnostic nonlaboratory x-ray tests and other diagnostic tests, as well as x-ray, radium, and radioisotope therapy. Generally, these services are paid for under the physician fee schedule, with beneficiaries responsible for a 20% coinsurance payment. Medicare covers a wide variety of equipment and devices under the heading of durable medical equipment (DME), prosthetics, and orthotics (PO) if they are medically necessary and are prescribed by a physician. DME is defined as equipment that (1) can withstand repeated use, (2) has an expected life of at least three years (effective for items classified as DME after January 1, 2012), (3) is used primarily to serve a medical purpose, (4) is not generally useful in the absence of an illness or injury, and (5) is appropriate for use in the home. DME includes such items as hospital beds, wheelchairs, blood glucose monitors, and oxygen and oxygen equipment. It also includes related supplies (S), such as drugs and biologics that are necessary for the effective use of the product. Prosthetics (P) are items that replace all or part of a body organ or its function, such as colostomy bags, pacemakers, and artificial eyes, arms, or legs. Orthotics (O) are braces that support a weak or deformed body member, such as leg or back braces. Except in competitive bidding areas (CBAs, described below), Medicare pays for most durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) based on fee schedules. Medicare pays 80% of the lower of the supplier's charge for the item or the fee schedule amount. The beneficiary is responsible for the remaining 20%. In general, fee schedule amounts are updated each year by a (1) measure of price inflation, and (2) a measure of economy-wide productivity, which may result in lower fee schedule amounts from one year to the next. Since 2016, the fee schedule rates that applied outside of competitive bidding areas for certain DMEPOS have been reduced based on price information from the competitive bidding program. The reductions were phased in during 2016, and fully phased in starting in January 2017. In response to concerns that the adjusted rates were too low, the Secretary again applied the phase-in rate for rural and noncontiguous areas not subject to competitive bidding starting in June 2018. Currently, two different fee schedules apply outside of CBAs. First, in rural or noncontiguous areas, the fee schedule is a 50/50 blend of the fee schedule with and without the reductions based on information from competitive bidding (i.e., the phase-in methodology). Second, in nonrural and contiguous areas, the fee schedule amounts are fully adjusted by information from the competitive bidding program. Numerous studies and investigations indicated that Medicare paid more for certain items of DME and PO than some other health insurers and some retail outlets. Such overpayments were attributed, in part, to the fee schedule mechanism of payment. MMA required the Secretary to establish a Competitive Acquisition Program for certain DMEPOS in specified areas. Instead of paying for medical equipment based on a fee schedule established by law, payment for items in competitive bidding areas was based on the supplier bids. The program started in 9 metropolitan areas in January 2011 and had expanded to 130 competitive bidding areas in 2018. However, the program has been suspended while a new bidding methodology is established. During the gap, the payments for previously competitively bid items in competitive bidding areas will be the amounts that applied on December 31, 2018, increased, yearly, by a measure of inflation. Certain specified outpatient prescription drugs and biologics are covered under Medicare Part B. (However, most outpatient prescription drugs are covered under Part D, discussed below.) Covered Part B drugs and biologics include drugs furnished incident to physician services, immunosuppressive drugs following a Medicare-covered organ transplant, erythropoietin for treatment of anemia for individuals with ESRD when not part of the ESRD composite rate, oral anticancer drugs (provided they have the same active ingredients and are used for the same indications as chemotherapy drugs that would be covered if furnished incident to physician services), certain vaccines under selected conditions, and drugs administered through DME. Generally, Medicare reimburses physicians and other providers, such as hospital outpatient clinics, for covered Part B drugs and biologics at 106% of the volume weighted average sales price of all drugs billed under the same billing code, although some Part B drugs, such as those administered through DME, are reimbursed at 95% of the drug's average wholesale price. Health care providers also are paid separately for administering Medicare Part B drugs. Medicare pays 80% of the amount paid to providers, and beneficiaries are responsible for the remaining 20%. A hospital outpatient is a person who has not been admitted by the hospital as an inpatient but is registered on the hospital records as an outpatient. Generally, payments under the hospital outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) cover the operating and capital-related costs that are directly related and integral to performing a procedure or furnishing a service on an outpatient basis. These payments cover services such as the use of an operating suite, treatment, procedure, or recovery room; use of an observation bed as well as anesthesia; certain drugs or pharmaceuticals; incidental services; and other necessary or implantable supplies or services. Payments for services such as those provided by physicians and other professionals as well as therapy and clinical diagnostic laboratory services, among others, are separate. Under the OPPS, the unit of payment for acute care hospitals is the individual service or procedure as assigned to an ambulatory payment classification (APC). To the extent possible, integral services and items (excluding physician services paid under the physician fee schedule) are bundled within each APC. Specified new technologies are assigned to ""new technology APCs"" until clinical and cost data are available to permit assignment into a ""clinical APC."" Medicare's hospital outpatient payment is calculated by multiplying the relative weight associated with an APC by a conversion factor. For most APCs, 60% of the conversion factor is geographically adjusted by the wage index used for the inpatient prospective payment system. Except for new technology APCs, each APC has a relative weight that is based on the median cost of services in that APC. The OPPS also includes pass-through payments for new technologies (specific drugs, biologicals, and devices) and payments for outliers. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) has recommended site-neutral payment policies that base payments on the resources needed to provide high-quality care in the most efficient setting. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 15; P.L. 114-74 ) gave CMS the authority to add new restrictions on Medicare payments for services furnished in provider-based off-campus hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs) to address discrepancies between payments under the MPFS and the OPPS for similar services. In its 2019 OPPS Final Rule, CMS explicitly applies the site-neutral policy to clinic visits, the most commonly billed service in hospital outpatient departments. An ambulatory surgical center (ASC) is a distinct entity that furnishes outpatient surgical procedures to patients who do not require an overnight stay after the procedure. According to MedPAC, most ASCs are freestanding facilities rather than part of a larger facility, such as a hospital. Medicare covers surgical and medical services performed in an ambulatory surgical center that are (1) commonly performed on an inpatient basis but may be safely performed in an ASC; (2) not of a type that are commonly performed or that may be safely performed in physicians' offices; (3) limited to procedures requiring a dedicated operating room or suite and generally requiring a postoperative recovery room or short-term (not overnight) convalescent room; and (4) not otherwise excluded from Medicare coverage. Medicare pays for surgery-related facility services provided in ASCs using a prospective payment system based on the OPPS. (Associated physician fees are paid for separately under the physician fee schedule.) Each of the approximately 3,500 procedures approved for payment in an ASC is classified into an APC group on the basis of clinical and cost similarity. The ASC system primarily uses the same payment groups as the OPPS; however, ASC payment rates are generally lower. The ASC weights are scaled (reduced) to account for the different mix of services in an ASC, and the ASC conversion factor (the base payment amount) is lower. A different payment method is used to set ASC payment for office-based procedures, separately payable radiology services, separately payable drugs, and device-intensive procedures. In addition, separate payments are made for certain ancillary items and services when they are integral to surgical procedures, including corneal tissue acquisition, brachytherapy sources, certain radiology services, many drugs, and certain implantable devices. The application of the site-neutral payment policy to clinic visits also affects such payments to ASCs (see discussion above). Medicare Part B covers emergency and nonemergency ambulance services to or from a hospital, a critical access hospital, a skilled nursing facility, or a dialysis facility for End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) beneficiaries who require dialysis when other modes of transportation could endanger the Medicare beneficiary's health. In most cases, the program covers 80% of the allowed amount for the service, and the beneficiary is responsible for the remaining 20%. Generally, ambulance services are covered if (1) transportation of the beneficiary occurs; (2) the beneficiary is taken to an appropriate location (generally, the closest appropriate facility); (3) the ambulance service is medically necessary (other forms of transportation are contraindicated); (4) the ambulance provider or supplier meets state licensing requirements; and (5) the transportation is not part of a Medicare Part A covered stay. Medicare covers both scheduled and nonscheduled nonemergency transports if the beneficiary is bed-confined or meets other medical necessity criteria. Medicare may also cover emergency ambulance transportation by airplane or helicopter if the beneficiary's location is not easily reached by ground transportation or if long distance or obstacles, such as heavy traffic, would prevent the individual from obtaining needed care. Medicare pays for ambulance services according to a national fee schedule. The fee schedule establishes seven categories of ground ambulance services and two categories of air ambulance services. Medicare pays for different levels of ambulance services, which reflect the staff training and equipment required to meet the patient's medical condition or health needs. Generally, basic life support is provided by emergency medical technicians (EMTs). Advanced life support is provided by EMTs with advanced training or by paramedics. Some rural ground and air ambulance services may qualify for increased payments. Also, ambulance providers that are CAHs, or that are entities that are owned and operated by a CAH, are paid on a reasonable-cost basis rather than the fee schedule if they are the only ambulance provider within a 35-mile radius. Medicare covers Part B services in rural health clinics (RHCs) and federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) provided by (1) physicians and specified nonphysician practitioners; (2) visiting nurses for homebound patients in home health shortage areas; (3) registered dieticians or nutritional professionals for diabetes training and medical nutrition therapy; and (4) others, as well as certain drugs administered by a physician or nonphysician practitioner. RHCs are paid based on an ""all-inclusive"" cost-based rate per beneficiary visit subject to a per visit upper limit, adjusted annually for inflation. For cost-reporting periods that began on or after October 1, 2014, FQHCs are paid a base payment rate per visit (with a limit, in most cases, of one billable visit per day) under a PPS methodology. Each FQHC's PPS rate is adjusted based on the location where the service is furnished using geographic adjustment factors, which are the geographic practice cost indices (GPCI) used in Medicare's physician fee schedule (MPFS). This rate is increased by 34% for new patients (those not seen in the FQHC organization within the past three years). The 34% increase also applies when a beneficiary receives a comprehensive initial Medicare visit (an initial preventive physician examination or an initial annual wellness visit) or a subsequent annual wellness visit. Effective January 1, 2017, the FQHC PPS base rate is updated annually using an FQHC-specific market basket. Medicare's payment to the FQHC is equal to 80% of the lesser of the adjusted PPS rate or the FQHC's actual charges associated with the visit, and the beneficiary is responsible for a 20% coinsurance. Medicare Advantage (MA) is an alternative way for Medicare beneficiaries to receive covered benefits. Under MA, private health plans are paid a per-person amount to provide all Medicare covered benefits (except hospice) to beneficiaries who enroll in their plan. Medicare beneficiaries who are eligible for Part A, enrolled in Part B, and do not have ESRD are eligible to enroll in an MA plan if one is available in their area. Some MA plans may choose their service area (local MA plans), while others agree to serve one or more regions defined by the Secretary (regional MA plans). In 2019, nearly all Medicare beneficiaries have access to an MA plan and approximately a third of beneficiaries are enrolled in one. Private plans may use different techniques to influence the medical care used by enrollees. Some plans, such as health maintenance organizations (HMOs), may require enrollees to receive care from a restricted network of medical providers; enrollees may be required to see a primary care physician who will coordinate their care and refer them to specialists as necessary. Other types of private plans, such as private fee-for-service (PFFS) plans, may look more like original Medicare, with fewer restrictions on the providers an enrollee can see and minimal coordination of care. In general, MA plans offer additional benefits or require smaller co-payments or deductibles than original Medicare. Sometimes beneficiaries pay for these additional benefits through a higher monthly premium, but sometimes they are financed through plan savings. The extent of extra benefits and reduced cost sharing varies by plan type and geography. However, MA plans are seen by some beneficiaries as an attractive alternative to more expensive supplemental insurance policies found in the private market. By contract with CMS, a plan agrees to provide all required services covered in return for a capitated monthly payment adjusted for the demographics and health history of their enrollees. The same monthly payment is made regardless of how many or few services a beneficiary actually uses. In general, the plan is at-risk if costs, in the aggregate, exceed program payments; conversely, the plan can retain savings if aggregate costs are less than payments. Payments to MA plans are based on a comparison of each plan's estimated cost of providing Medicare covered services (a bid) relative to the maximum amount the federal government will pay for providing those services in the plan's service area (a benchmark). If a plan's bid is less than the benchmark, its payment equals its bid plus a rebate. The size of the rebate is dependent on plan quality and ranges from 50% to 70% of the difference between the bid and the benchmark. The rebate must be returned to enrollees in the form of additional benefits, reduced cost sharing, reduced Part B or Part D premiums, or some combination of these options. If a plan's bid is equal to or above the benchmark, its payment will be the benchmark amount and each enrollee in that plan will pay an additional premium, equal to the amount by which the bid exceeds the benchmark. The MA benchmarks are determined through statutorily specified formulas that have changed over time. Since BBA 97, formulas have increased the benchmark amounts, in part, to encourage plan participation in all areas of the country. As a result, however, the benchmark amounts (and plan payments) in some areas have been higher than the average cost of original FFS Medicare. The ACA changed the way benchmarks are calculated by tying them closer to (or below) spending in FFS Medicare, and adjusting them based on plan quality. In a recent analysis, MedPAC found that ""over the past few years, plan bids and payments have come down in relation to FFS spending while MA enrollment continues to grow. The pressure of lower benchmarks has led to improved efficiencies and more competitive bids that enable MA plans to continue to increase enrollment by offering benefits that beneficiaries find attractive."" In 2006, the MA program began to offer MA regional plans. Regional MA plans must agree to serve one or more regions designated by the Secretary. There are 26 MA regions consisting of states or groups of states. Regional plan benchmarks include two components: (1) a statutorily determined amount (comparable to benchmarks described above) and (2) a weighted average of plan bids. Thus, a portion of the benchmark is competitively determined. Similar to local plans, plans with bids below the benchmark are given a rebate, while plans with bids above the benchmark require an additional enrollee premium. In general, MA eligible individuals may enroll in any MA plan that serves their area. However, some MA plans may restrict their enrollment to beneficiaries who meet additional criteria. For example, employer-sponsored MA plans are generally only available to the retirees of the company sponsoring the plan. In addition, Medicare Special Needs Plans (SNPs) are a type of coordinated care MA plan that exclusively enrolls, or enrolls a disproportionate percentage of, special needs individuals. Special needs individuals are any MA eligible individuals who are either institutionalized as defined by the Secretary, eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, or have a severe or disabling chronic condition and would benefit from enrollment in a specialized MA plan. Medicare Part D provides coverage of outpatient prescription drugs to Medicare beneficiaries who choose to enroll in this optional benefit. (As previously discussed, Part B provides limited coverage of some outpatient prescription drugs.) In 2019, about 47 million (about 77%) of eligible Medicare beneficiaries are estimated to be enrolled in a Part D plan. Prescription drug coverage is provided through private prescription drug plans (PDPs), which offer only prescription drug coverage, or through Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans (MA-PDs), which offer prescription drug coverage that is integrated with the health care coverage they provide to Medicare beneficiaries under Part C. Plans must meet certain minimum requirements; however, there are significant variations among them in benefit design, including differences in premiums, drugs included on plan formularies, and cost sharing for particular drugs. Part D prescription drug plans are required to offer either ""standard coverage"" or alternative coverage that has actuarially equivalent benefits. In 2019, ""standard coverage"" has a $415 deductible and a 25% coinsurance for costs between $415 and $3,820. From this point, there is reduced coverage until the beneficiary has out-of-pocket costs of $5,100 (an estimated $8,139.54 in total spending); this coverage gap has been labeled the ""doughnut hole."" Once the beneficiary reaches the catastrophic limit, the program pays all costs except for the greater of 5% coinsurance or $3.40 for a generic drug and $8.50 for a brand-name drug. As required by the ACA, in 2010, Medicare sent a tax-free, one-time $250 rebate check to each Part D enrollee who reached the doughnut hole. Additionally, starting in 2011, the coverage gap is being gradually reduced each year. Under the ACA, the coverage gap for both brand-name and generic drugs was to be eliminated in 2020, but Congress moved up the date to 2019 for brand-name drugs as part of BBA 18. In 2019, a 70% discount is provided by drug manufacturers and Medicare pays an additional 5% of the cost of brand-name drugs dispensed during the coverage gap. In 2019, Medicare also pays 63% of the cost of generic drugs dispensed during the coverage gap and enrollees pay 37%. (See Figure 2 .) By 2020, through a combination of manufacturer discounts and increased Medicare coverage, Part D enrollees will be responsible for 25% of the costs for brand-name and generic drugs in the coverage gap (the same as during the initial coverage period). Most plans offer actuarially equivalent benefits rather than the standard package, including alternatives such as reducing or eliminating the deductible, or using tiered cost sharing with lower cost sharing for generic drugs. Medicare's payments to plans are determined through a competitive bidding process, and enrollee premiums are tied to plan bids. Plans are paid a risk-adjusted monthly per capita amount based on their bids during a given plan year. Part D plan sponsors determine payments for drugs and are expected to negotiate prices. The federal government is prohibited from interfering in the price negotiations between drug manufacturers, pharmacies, and plans (the so-called ""non-interference clause""). Part D also provides enhanced coverage for low-income enrolled individuals, such as persons who previously received drug benefits under Medicaid (known as ""dual eligibles""—enrollees in both Medicare and Medicaid). Additionally, certain persons who do not qualify for Medicaid, but whose incomes are below 150% of poverty, may also receive assistance for some portion of their premium and cost-sharing charges. The MMA included significant incentives for employers to continue to offer coverage to their retirees by providing a 28% federal subsidy. In 2019, the maximum potential subsidy per covered retiree is $2,264 for employers or unions offering drug coverage that is at least actuarially equivalent (called ""creditable"" coverage) to standard coverage. Employers or unions may select an alternative option (instead of taking the subsidy) with respect to Part D, such as electing to pay a portion of the Part D premiums. They may also elect to provide enhanced coverage, though this has some financial consequences for the employer or union. Alternatively, employers or unions may contract with a PDP or MA-PD to offer the coverage or become a Part D plan sponsor themselves for their retirees. A variety of public and private entities are involved in carrying out Medicare administrative and oversight functions. CMS, an agency within HHS, has primary operational responsibilities. Such responsibilities include managing program finances, developing policies and regulations, setting payment rates, and developing the program's information-technology infrastructure. CMS conducts its activities through its headquarters and 10 regional offices. The Social Security Administration, however, enrolls beneficiaries into the program and issues Medicare beneficiary cards. CMS also contracts with various private entities, including private health insurance companies, to help administer the program. For example, Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) process and pay Parts A and B reimbursement claims, enroll providers and suppliers, educate providers and suppliers on billing requirements, support appeal processes, and answer provider and supplier inquiries through call centers, as well as other activities. Qualified Independent Contractors (QICs) perform second-level reviews on appeals initially reviewed by MACs. Medicare's quality assurance activities are primarily handled by State Survey Agencies and Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs), which operate in all states and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The State Survey Agencies are responsible for inspecting Medicare provider facilities (e.g., nursing homes, home health agencies, and hospitals) to ensure that they are in compliance with federal safety and quality standards referred to as Conditions (or Requirements) of Participation. Alternatively, some types of providers, including hospitals, may receive certification through private accrediting agencies, such as the Joint Commission. QIOs are mostly private, not-for-profit organizations that monitor the quality of care delivered to Medicare beneficiaries and educate providers on the latest quality-improvement techniques. Medicare program integrity activities, such as audits, provider education, medical review, and predictive data analysis, also are carried out by a variety of government and private entities. For example, the Center for Program Integrity within CMS works together with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) to identify and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicare. CMS also works with private contractors to carry out certain program-integrity functions. Unified Program Integrity Contractors (UPICs) perform integrity-related activities including data analysis to identify potentially fraudulent claims (bills) for Medicare Parts A and B, home health and hospice services, and DME. Similarly, the National Benefit Integrity Medicare Drug Integrity Contractor (MEDIC) is responsible for identifying and investigating fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicare Advantage and Part D. When appropriate, the UPICs and MEDIC work with and refer cases to law enforcement, including OIG and DOJ. In addition, Recovery Audit Contractors (RACs) are responsible for identifying improper Medicare payments, including both underpayments and overpayments, and for recouping any overpayments made to providers. Each year, the Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT) program quantifies a national improper Medicare payment rate by examining a random sample of claims. In turn, the Supplemental Medical Review Contractor targets medical reviews in areas where OIG, RACs, and CERT have identified vulnerabilities and/or questionable billing patterns to identify ways to lower improper payment rates. As required by the ACA, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) was established in January 2011 to test and evaluate innovative payment and service delivery models to reduce program expenditures under Medicare. Examples of these models include providing payment incentives for groups of doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers (Accountable Care Organizations, or ACOs) to coordinate the services they provide to Medicare beneficiaries; bundling payments for services provided in different settings during a beneficiary's episode of care; and reimbursing health providers based on the quality of care rather than on the volume of services. CMMI also plays an important role in developing and implementing the new physician payment models required by MACRA. Medicare beneficiary education and outreach duties are shared between CMS and the Social Security Administration. Each year, CMS mails out a ""Medicare and You"" handbook to beneficiaries, which provides information on their benefits for the upcoming year. Additional educational materials and responses to frequently asked questions may be found on the CMS-maintained ""Medicare.gov"" website, and beneficiaries may call a CMS-operated 1-800 number for assistance with specific questions and help with selecting and enrolling in a Medicare Advantage and/or Part D plan. A Medicare beneficiary ombudsman is also available to provide assistance to Medicare consumers with their complaints, grievances, and requests. The Social Security Administration is responsible for notifying low-income Medicare beneficiaries about programs that may be able to assist them with their medical and prescription drug expenses. The Social Security Administration also provides general Medicare eligibility and enrollment information on its webpage and on Social Security benefit statements. Finally, CMS partners with community-based organizations, such as State Health Insurance Assistance Programs, in every state to provide educational resources and personalized assistance to Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare's financial operations are accounted for through two trust funds maintained by the Department of the Treasury—the Hospital Insurance (HI) trust fund for Part A and the Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) trust fund for Parts B and D. For beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage (Part C), payments are made on their behalf in appropriate portions from the HI and SMI trust funds. HI is primarily funded by payroll taxes, while SMI is primarily funded through general revenue transfers and premiums. (See Figure 3 .) The HI and SMI trust funds are overseen by a Board of Trustees that provides annual reports to Congress. The trust funds are accounting mechanisms. Income to the trust funds is credited to the fund in the form of interest-bearing government securities. Expenditures for services and administrative costs are recorded against the fund. These securities represent obligations that the government has issued to itself. As long as a trust fund has a balance, the Department of the Treasury is authorized to make payments for it from the U.S. Treasury. Medicare expenditures are primarily paid for through mandatory spending—generally Medicare pays for all covered health care services provided to beneficiaries. Aside from certain constraints in HI described below, the program is not subject to spending limits. Additionally, most Medicare expenditures (aside from premiums paid by beneficiaries) are paid for by current workers through income taxes and dedicated Medicare payroll taxes, that is, current income is used to pay current expenditures. Medicare taxes paid by current workers are not set aside to cover their future Medicare expenses. The primary source of funding for Part A is payroll taxes paid by employees and employers. Each pays a tax of 1.45% on the employee's earnings; the self-employed pay 2.9%. Beginning in 2013, some higher-income employees pay higher payroll taxes. Unlike Social Security, there is no upper limit on earnings subject to the tax. Other sources of income include (1) interest on federal securities held by the trust fund, (2) a portion of federal income taxes that individuals pay on their Social Security benefits, and (3) premiums paid by voluntary enrollees who are not automatically entitled to Medicare Part A. Income for Part A is credited to the HI trust fund. Part A expenditures for CY2019 are estimated to reach approximately $330 billion. Revenue to the trust fund is expected to consist of about $285 billion in payroll tax income and another $38 billion in interest and other income. The Medicare Trustees project that in CY2019, the HI trust fund will incur a deficit of approximately $7 billion. As long as the HI trust fund has a balance, the Treasury Department is authorized to make payments for Medicare Part A services. To date, the HI trust fund has never run out of money (i.e., become insolvent), and there are no provisions in the Social Security Act that govern what would happen if that were to occur. Part A expenditures exceeded HI income each year from 2008 through 2015, and the assets credited to the trust fund were drawn down to make up the deficit in those years. Although the HI trust fund accumulated small surpluses in 2016 and 2017, the Medicare Trustees estimate that, beginning in 2018, expenditures will outpace income in all future years, and project that the HI trust fund will become insolvent in 2026 (i.e., the balance of the trust fund will reach $0). At that time there would no longer be sufficient funds to fully cover Part A expenditures. Medicare Part B is financed primarily from federal general revenues and from beneficiary premiums, which are set at 25% of estimated per capita program costs for the aged. (The disabled pay the same premium as the aged.) Income for Part B is credited to the SMI trust fund. Total spending for Part B is estimated to reach about $368 billion in CY2019, with premiums financing about $98 billion of that amount and general revenues financing most of the rest. Most beneficiaries who enroll in Medicare Part B pay a monthly premium. Individuals receiving Social Security benefits have their Part B premium payments automatically deducted from their Social Security benefit checks. Due to a ""hold-harmless"" provision in the Social Security Act, an individual's Social Security check cannot decrease from one year to the next as a result of the annual Part B premium increase (except in the case of higher-income individuals subject to income-related premiums). The 2019 monthly Part B premium is $135.50. However, about 3.5% of Medicare enrollees are protected by the hold-harmless provision and pay lower premium amounts because the dollar amount of the 2019 cost-of-living increase in their Social Security benefits was not sufficient to cover the full premium increase. Since 2007, higher-income Part B enrollees have paid higher premiums. In 2019, individuals whose modified adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeds $85,000 and each member of a couple filing jointly whose modified AGI exceeds $170,000 are subject to higher premium amounts. These higher-income premiums range from 35% to 85% of the value of Part B and affect about 5% of Medicare enrollees. (See Appendix B for 2019 Part B premiums and high-income thresholds.) Payments for spending under the Medicare Advantage program are made in appropriate portions from the HI and SMI trust funds. There is no separate trust fund for Part C. Medicare Part D is financed through a combination of beneficiary premiums and federal general revenues. In addition, certain transfers are made from the states. These transfers, referred to as ""clawback payments,"" represent a portion of the amounts states could otherwise have been expected to pay for drugs under Medicaid if drug coverage for the dual eligible population had not been transferred to Part D. Part D revenues are credited to a separate Part D account within the SMI trust fund. In CY2019, total spending for Part D is estimated to reach approximately $98 billion, with about $71 billion of that amount paid for by general revenues, $16 billion from beneficiary premiums, and $12 billion from state transfers. In 2019, the base beneficiary premium is $33.19; however, beneficiaries pay different premiums depending on the plan they have selected and whether they are entitled to low-income premium subsidies. Additionally, beginning in 2011, higher income Part D enrollees pay higher premiums. (The income thresholds are the same as for Part B, as described above.) On average, beneficiary premiums are set at 25.5% of expected total Part D costs for basic coverage. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25 ) provided for increases in the debt limit and established procedures designed to reduce the federal budget deficit, including the creation of a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. The failure of the Joint Committee to propose deficit reduction legislation by its mandated deadline triggered automatic spending reductions (""sequestration"" of mandatory spending and reductions in discretionary spending) in fiscal years 2013 through 2021. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA; P.L. 112-240 ) delayed the automatic reductions by two months, while the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (BBA; P.L. 113-67 ) extended sequestration for mandatory spending for an additional two years—through FY2023. In 2014, the President signed into law an amended version of S. 25 ( P.L. 113-82 ), which included a provision to extend BCA's sequester of mandatory spending through FY2024. BBA 15 extended the sequestration of mandatory spending another year, through FY2025. Most recently, BBA 18 extended the BCA mandatory spending sequester through FY2027. Section 256(d) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA; P.L. 99-177 ) contains special rules for the Medicare program in the event of a sequestration. Among other things, it specifies that for Medicare, sequestration is to begin the month after the sequestration order has been issued. Therefore, as the sequestration order was issued March 2013, Medicare sequestration began April 1, 2013, and will continue through March 31, 2028. Under sequestration, Medicare's benefit structure generally remains unchanged; however, benefit related payments are subject to 2% reductions. In other words, most Medicare payments to health care providers, as well as to MA and Part D plans, are being reduced by 2%. Certain Medicare payments are exempt from sequestration and therefore not reduced. These exemptions include (1) Part D low-income subsidies, (2) the Part D catastrophic subsidy, and (3) Qualified Individual (QI) premiums. Some non-benefit related Medicare expenses, such as administrative and operational spending, are subject to higher reductions, 6.2% in 2019. While Medicare provides broad protection against the costs of many, primarily acute care, services, the program does not cover all services that may be used by its aged and disabled beneficiaries. In general, Medicare does not cover eyeglasses, hearing aids, dentures, or most long-term care services. Further, unlike most private insurance policies, it does not include an annual ""catastrophic"" cap on out-of-pocket spending on cost-sharing charges for services covered under Parts A and B (except for persons enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans). Most Medicare beneficiaries have some coverage in addition to Medicare. The following are the main sources of additional coverage for Medicare enrollees: Medicare Advantage. Many MA plans offer services in addition to those covered under original Medicare, reduced cost sharing, or reduced Part B or D premiums. All MA plans have a catastrophic cap. Employer Coverage. Coverage may be provided through a current or former employer. In recent years, a number of employers have cut back on the scope of retiree coverage. Some have dropped such coverage entirely, particularly for future retirees. As noted earlier, the MMA attempted to stem this trend, at least for prescription drug coverage, by offering subsidies to employers who offer drug coverage, at least as good as that available under Part D. Medigap. Individual insurance policies that supplement fee-for-service Medicare are referred to as Medigap policies. Beneficiaries with Medigap insurance typically have coverage for a portion of Medicare's deductibles and coinsurance; they may also have coverage for some items and services not covered by Medicare. Individuals select from a set of standardized plans, though not all plans are offered in all states. Medicaid. Certain low-income Medicare beneficiaries also may be eligible for full or partial benefits under their state's Medicaid program. Individuals eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid are referred to as dual eligibles. The lowest-income dual eligibles qualify for full Medicaid benefits, so that the majority of their health care expenses are paid by either Medicare or Medicaid; Medicare pays first, with Medicaid picking up most of the remaining costs. In addition to full-benefit dual eligibles, state Medicaid programs pay Medicare premiums and some cost sharing for other partial dual eligibles, who have higher income than full-benefit dual eligibles but are still considered to have low income. Other Public Sources. Individuals may have additional coverage through the Department of Veterans Affairs, or TRICARE for military retirees eligible for Medicare (and enrolled in Part B). In 2015, about 87% of Medicare beneficiaries had some form of additional coverage. Some persons may have had more than one type of additional coverage. Appendix A. Abbreviations Appendix B. 2019 Medicare Beneficiary Costs\n\n","['Medicare is a federal program that pays for covered health care services of qualified beneficiaries. It was established in 1965 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide health insurance to individuals 65 and older, and has been expanded over the years to include permanently disabled individuals under the age of 65. Medicare, which consists of four parts (A-D), covers hospitalizations, physician services, prescription drugs, skilled nursing facility care, home health visits, and hospice care, among other services. Generally, individuals are eligible for Medicare if they or their spouse worked for at least 40 quarters in Medicare-covered employment, are 65 years old, and are a citizen or permanent resident of the United States. Individuals may also qualify for coverage if they are a younger person who cannot work because they have a medical condition that is expected to last at least one year or result in death, or have end-stage renal disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplant). The program is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and by private entities that contract with CMS to provide claims processing, auditing, and quality oversight services. In FY2019, the program is expected to cover approximately 61 million persons (52 million aged and 9 million disabled) at a total cost of about $772 billion. Spending under the program (except for a portion of administrative costs) is considered mandatory spending and is not subject to the annual appropriations process. Services provided under Parts A and B (also referred to as ""original"" or ""traditional"" Medicare) are generally paid directly by the government on a ""fee-for-service"" basis, using different prospective payment systems or fee schedules. Under Parts C and D, private insurers are paid a monthly ""capitated"" amount to provide enrollees with required benefits. Medicare is required to pay for all covered services provided to eligible persons, so long as specific criteria are met. Since 1965, the Medicare program has undergone considerable change. For example, during the 111th Congress, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148 and P.L. 111-152) made numerous changes to the Medicare program that modified provider reimbursements, provided incentives to increase the quality and efficiency of care, and enhanced certain Medicare benefits. In the 114th Congress, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA; P.L. 114-10) changed the method for calculating updates to Medicare payment rates to physicians and altered how physicians and other practitioners will be paid in the future. Projections of future Medicare expenditures and funding indicate that the program will place increasing financial demands on the federal budget and on beneficiaries. For example, the Hospital Insurance (Part A) trust fund is projected to become insolvent in 2026. Additionally, although the Supplementary Medical Insurance (Parts B and D) trust fund is financed in large part through federal general revenues and cannot become insolvent, associated spending growth is expected to put increasing strains on the country\'s competing spending priorities. As such, Medicare is expected to be a high-priority issue in the current Congress, and Congress may consider a variety of Medicare reform options ranging from further modifications of provider payment mechanisms to redesigning the entire program. This report provides a general overview of the Medicare program including descriptions of the program\'s history, eligibility criteria, covered services, provider payment systems, and program administration and financing. A list of commonly used acronyms, as well as information on beneficiary cost sharing, may be found in the appendixes.']","13111","gov_report","en","None","41203c9bcb9e82d6bfa289c0641ca1ef08073d52ceeec7f5","Summary:","gov_report","532","\n\nThe Medicare program is a federal program in the United States that provides health insurance coverage for individuals aged 65 and older, as well as for some younger individuals with disabilities.

Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nU.S. foreign aid is the largest component of the international affairs budget, for decades viewed by many as an essential instrument of U.S. foreign policy. Each year, the foreign aid budget is the subject of congressional debate over the size, composition, and purpose of the program. The focus of U.S. foreign aid policy has been transformed since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Global development, a major objective of foreign aid, has been cited as a third pillar of U.S. national security, along with defense and diplomacy, in the national security strategies of the George W. Bush and Barack Obama Administrations. Although the Trump Administration's National Security Strategy does not explicitly address the status of development vis-à-vis diplomacy and defense, it does note the historic importance of aid in achieving foreign policy goals and supporting U.S. national interests. This report addresses a number of the more frequently asked questions regarding the U.S. foreign aid program; its objectives, costs, and organization; the role of Congress; and how it compares to those of other aid donors. It attempts not only to present a current snapshot of American foreign assistance, but also to illustrate the extent to which this instrument of U.S. foreign policy has evolved over time. Data presented in the report are the most current, consistent, and reliable figures available, generally updated through FY2017. Dollar amounts come from a variety of sources, including the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Foreign Aid Explorer database (Explorer) and annual State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) appropriations acts. As new data are obtained or additional issues and questions arise, the report will be revised. Foreign aid abbreviations used in this report are listed in Appendix B . In its broadest sense, U.S. foreign aid is defined under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA), the primary legislative basis of foreign aid programs, as any tangible or intangible item provided by the United States Government [including ""by means of gift, loan, sale, credit, or guaranty""] to a foreign country or international organization under this or any other Act, including but not limited to any training, service, or technical advice, any item of real, personal, or mixed property, any agricultural commodity, United States dollars, and any currencies of any foreign country which are owned by the United States Government.... (§634(b)) For many decades, nearly all assistance annually requested by the executive branch and debated and authorized by Congress was ultimately encompassed in the foreign operations appropriations and the international food aid title of the agriculture appropriations. In the U.S. federal budget, these traditional foreign aid accounts have been subsumed under the 150 (international affairs) budget function. By the 1990s, however, it became increasingly apparent that the scope of U.S. foreign aid was not fully accounted for by the total of the foreign operations and international food aid appropriations. Many U.S. departments and agencies had adopted their own assistance programs, funded out of their own budgets and commonly in the form of professional exchanges with counterpart agencies abroad—the Environmental Protection Agency, for example, providing water quality expertise to other governments. These aid efforts, conducted outside the purview of the traditional foreign aid authorizing and appropriations committees, grew more substantial and varied in the mid-1990s. The Department of Defense (DOD) Nunn-Lugar effort provided billions in aid to secure and eliminate nuclear and other weapons, as did Department of Energy activities to control and protect nuclear materials—both aimed largely at the former Soviet Union. Growing participation by DOD in health and humanitarian efforts and expansion of health programs in developing countries by the National Institutes of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, especially in response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, followed. During the past 15 years, DOD-funded and implemented aid programs in Iraq and Afghanistan to train and equip foreign forces and win hearts and minds through development efforts were often considerably larger than the traditional military and development assistance programs provided under the foreign operations appropriations. The recent decline in DOD activities in these countries has sharply decreased nontraditional aid funding. In FY2011, nontraditional sources of assistance, at $17.3 billion, represented 35% of total aid obligations. By FY2017, nontraditional aid, at $9.7 billion, represented 19% of total aid, still a significant proportion. While the executive branch has continued to request and Congress to debate most foreign aid within the parameters of the foreign operations legislation, both entities have sought to ascertain a fuller picture of assistance programs through improved data collection and reporting. Significant discrepancies remain between data available for traditional versus nontraditional types of aid and, therefore, the level of analysis applied to each. (See text box , ""A Note on Numbers and Sources,"" below.) Nevertheless, to the extent possible, this report tries to capture the broadest definition of aid throughout. Foreign assistance is predicated on several rationales and supports a great many objectives. The importance and emphasis of various rationales and objectives have changed over time. Throughout the past 70 years, there have been three key rationales for foreign assistance National Security has been the predominant theme of U.S. assistance programs. From rebuilding Europe after World War II under the Marshall Plan (1948-1951) and through the Cold War, U.S. aid programs were viewed by policymakers as a way to prevent the incursion of communist influence and secure U.S. base rights or other support in the anti-Soviet struggle. After the Cold War ended, the focus of foreign aid shifted from global anti-communism to disparate regional issues, such as Middle East peace initiatives, the transition to democracy of eastern Europe and republics of the former Soviet Union, and international illicit drug production and trafficking in the Andes. Without an overarching security rationale, foreign aid budgets decreased in the 1990s. However, since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States, policymakers frequently have cast foreign assistance as a tool in U.S. counterterrorism strategy, increasing aid to partner states in counterterrorism efforts and funding the substantial reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq. As noted, global development has been featured as a key element in U.S. national security strategy in both Bush and Obama Administration policy statements. Commercial Interests. Foreign assistance has long been defended as a way to either promote U.S. exports by creating new customers for U.S. products or by improving the global economic environment in which U.S. companies compete. Humanitarian Concerns. Humanitarian concerns drive both short-term assistance in response to crisis and disaster as well as long-term development assistance aimed at reducing poverty, hunger, and other forms of human suffering brought on by more systemic problems. Providing assistance for humanitarian reasons has generally been the aid rationale most broadly supported by the American public and policymakers alike. The objectives of aid generally fit within these rationales. Aid objectives include promoting economic growth and reducing poverty, improving governance, addressing population growth, expanding access to basic education and health care, protecting the environment, promoting stability in conflictive regions, protecting human rights, promoting trade, curbing weapons proliferation, strengthening allies, and addressing drug production and trafficking. The expectation has been that, by meeting these and other aid objectives, the United States will achieve its national security goals as well as ensure a positive global economic environment for American products, and demonstrate benevolent and respectable global leadership. Different types of foreign aid typically support different objectives. But there is also considerable overlap among categories of aid. Multilateral aid serves many of the same objectives as bilateral development assistance, although through different channels. Military assistance, economic security aid—including rule of law and police training—and development assistance programs may support the same U.S. political objectives in the Middle East, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Military assistance and alternative development programs are integrated elements of American counternarcotics efforts in Latin America and elsewhere. Depending on how they are designed, individual assistance projects can also serve multiple purposes. A health project ostensibly directed at alleviating the effects of HIV/AIDS by feeding orphan children may also stimulate grassroots democracy and civil society through support of indigenous NGOs while additionally meeting U.S. humanitarian objectives. Microcredit programs that support small business development may help develop local economies while at the same time enabling client entrepreneurs to provide food and education to their children. Water and sanitation improvements both mitigate health threats and stimulate economic growth by saving time previously devoted to water collection, raising school attendance for girls, and facilitating tourism, among other effects. In 2006, in an effort to rationalize the assistance program more clearly, the State Department developed a framework that organizes U.S. foreign aid around five strategic objectives, each of which includes a number of program elements, also known as sectors. The five objectives are Peace and Security; Investing in People; Governing Justly and Democratically; Economic Growth; and Humanitarian Assistance. Generally, these objectives and their sectors do not correspond to any one particular budget account in appropriations bills. Annually, the Department of State and USAID develop their foreign operations budget request within this framework, allowing for an objective and program-oriented viewpoint for those who seek it. An effort by the State Department to obtain reporting from all departments and agencies of the U.S. government on aid levels categorized by objective and sector is ongoing. USAID's Explorer website (explorer.usaid.gov) currently provides a more complete picture from all parts of the U.S. government (see Table 1 ). The 2006 framework introduced by the Department of State organizes assistance by foreign policy strategic objective and sector. But there are many other ways to categorize foreign aid, one of which is to sort out and classify foreign aid accounts in the U.S. budget according to the types of activities they are expected to support, using broad categories such as military, bilateral development, multilateral development, humanitarian assistance, political/strategic, and nonmilitary security activities (see Figure 1 ). This methodology reflects the organization of aid accounts within the SFOPS appropriations but can easily be applied to the international food aid title of the Agriculture appropriations as well as to the DOD and other government agency assistance programs with funding outside traditional foreign aid budget accounts. In FY2017, these many aid accounts provided $49.9 billion in obligated assistance. For FY2017, U.S. government departments and agencies obligated about $16.2 billion in bilateral development assistance, or 33% of total foreign aid, primarily through the Development Assistance (DA) and Global Health (Global Health-USAID and Global Health-State) accounts and the administrative accounts that allow USAID to operate (Operating Expenses, Capital Investment Fund, and Office of the Inspector General). Other bilateral development assistance accounts support the development efforts of distinct institutions, such as the Peace Corps, Inter-American Foundation (IAF), U.S.-African Development Foundation, Trade and Development Agency, Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and National Endowment for Democracy (NED). Development assistance programs aim to foster sustainable broad-based economic progress and social stability in developing countries. This aid is managed largely by USAID and is used for long-term projects in a wide range of areas. Many programs share the objective in the State Department framework of ""promoting economic growth and prosperity."" Agriculture programs focus on reducing poverty and hunger, trade-promotion opportunities for farmers, and sound environmental practices for sustainable agriculture. Private sector development programs include support for business associations and microfinance services. Programs for managing natural resources and protecting the global environment focus on conserving biological diversity; improving the management of land, water, and forests; encouraging clean and efficient energy production and use; and reducing the threat of global climate change. Programs supporting the objective of ""governing justly and democratically"" include support for promoting rule of law and human rights, good governance, political competition, and civil society. Programs with the objective of ""investing in people"" include support for basic, secondary, and higher education; improving government ability to provide social services; water and sanitation; and health care. By far the largest portion of bilateral development assistance is devoted to global health. These programs include treatment of HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases, maternal and child health, family planning and reproductive health programs, and strengthening the government health systems that provide care. Most funding for HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis is directed through the State Department's Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator to other agencies, including USAID and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The latter agency and the National Institutes for Health also conduct programs funded by Labor-Health and Human Services (HHS) appropriations. In addition to providing emergency food aid in crisis situations, a portion (about 25% in FY2017) of the Food for Peace (FFP) Title II international food aid program (also referred to as P.L. 480, named after the 1954 law that authorized it)—funded under the Agriculture appropriations—provides nonemergency food commodities to private voluntary organizations (PVOs) or multilateral organizations, such as the World Food Program, for development-oriented purposes. FFP funds are also used to support the ""farmer-to-farmer"" program, which sends hundreds of U.S. volunteers as technical advisors to train farm and food-related groups throughout the world. In addition, the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program, a program begun in 2002, provides commodities, technical assistance, and financing for school feeding and child nutrition programs. A share of U.S. foreign assistance—4% in FY2017 ($2.1 billion)—is combined with contributions from other donor nations to finance multilateral development projects. Multilateral aid is funded largely through the International Organizations and Programs (IO&P) account and individual accounts for each of the Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) and global environmental funds. For FY2017, the U.S. government obligated $2.1 billion for development activities managed by international organizations and financial institutions, including contributions to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF); the United Nations Development Program (UNDP); and MDBs, such as the World Bank. The U.S. share of donor contributions to each of the MDB concessional (subsidized) and nonconcessional (market rate) loan windows varies widely. For the largest MDB, the World Bank, the United States has contributed about 20.5% to the nonconcessional lending window (the International Development Associations [IDA]) and about 17.3% to the nonconcessional lending window (the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development [IBRD]). In determining the U.S. share of donor contributions to the various multilateral institutions, the U.S. faces the challenge of finding the right balance between the benefits of burden sharing and the constraints of sharing control when determining multilateral priorities. For FY2017, obligations for humanitarian assistance programs amounted to $8.9 billion, 18% of total assistance. Unlike development assistance programs, which are often viewed as long-term efforts that may have the effect of preventing future crises from emerging, humanitarian assistance programs are devoted largely to the immediate alleviation of human suffering in emergencies, both natural and man-made, as well as problems resulting from conflict associated with failed or failing states. The largest portion of humanitarian assistance is managed through the International Disaster Assistance (IDA) account by USAID, which provides relief and rehabilitation efforts to victims of man-made and natural disasters, such as the economic and social dislocations caused by the 2014/2015 Ebola epidemic, and the ongoing crises in Syria, South Sudan, Yemen, and Venezuela. A portion of IDA is used for food assistance through the Emergency Food Security Program. Additional humanitarian assistance goes to programs administered by the State Department and funded under the Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) and the Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance (ERMA) accounts, aimed at addressing the needs of refugees and internally displaced persons. These accounts support a number of refugee relief organizations, including the U.N. High Commission for Refugees and the International Committee of the Red Cross. The Department of Defense provides disaster relief under the Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Assistance (OHDACA) account of the DOD appropriations. (For further information on humanitarian programs, see CRS In Focus IF10568, Overview of the Global Humanitarian and Displacement Crisis , by Rhoda Margesson.) The bulk of FFP Title II Agriculture appropriations—$1.3 billion in obligations, about 75% of total Food for Peace Act in FY2017—are used by USAID, mostly to purchase U.S. agricultural commodities, for emergency needs, supplementing both refugee and disaster programs. (For more information on food aid programs, see CRS Report R45422, U.S. International Food Assistance: An Overview , by Alyssa R. Casey.) A few accounts promote special U.S. political and strategic interests. Programs funded through the Economic Support Fund (ESF) account generally aim to promote political and economic stability, often through activities indistinguishable from those provided under regular development programs. However, ESF is also used for direct budget support to foreign governments and to support sovereign loan guarantees. For FY2017, USAID and the State Department obligated $4.8 billion, nearly 10% of total assistance, through this account. For many years, following the 1979 Camp David accords, most ESF funds went to support the Middle East Peace Process—in FY1997, for example, 87% of ESF went to Israel, Egypt, the West Bank and Jordan. Those proportions have declined significantly in recent decades. In FY2007, 22% of ESF funding went to these countries and, in FY2017, 25%. Since the September 2001 terrorist attacks, ESF has largely supported countries of importance in the U.S. global counterterrorism strategy. In FY2007, for example, activities is Afghanistan and Pakistan received 17% of ESF funding (25% in FY2017). Over the years, other accounts have been established to meet specific political or security interests and then were dissolved once the need was met. One example is the Assistance to Eastern Europe and Central Asia (AEECA) account, established in FY2009 to combine two aid programs that met particular strategic political interests arising from the demise of the Soviet empire. The SEED (Support for East European Democracy Act of 1989) and the FREEDOM Support Act (Freedom for Russia and Emerging Eurasian Democracies and Open Markets Support Act of 1992) programs were designed to help Central Europe and the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union (FSA) achieve democratic systems and free market economies. With funding decreasing as countries in the region graduated from U.S. assistance, Congress discontinued use of the AEECA account in the FY2013 appropriations. Increasing requests and appropriations for countries in the former Soviet Union threatened by Russia, however, led to its re-emergence in the FY2017 and succeeding SFOPS appropriations. In the recent past, several DOD-funded nontraditional aid programs directed at Afghanistan also supported development efforts. The Afghanistan Infrastructure Fund and the Business Task Force wound down as the U.S. military presence in that country declined; the Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) still exists. The latter two programs had earlier iterations as well in Iraq. Several U.S. government agencies support programs to address global concerns that are considered threats to U.S. security and well-being, such as terrorism, illicit narcotics, crime, and weapons proliferation. In the past two decades, policymakers have given greater weight to these programs. In FY2017, they amounted to $2.9 billion, 6% of total assistance Since the mid-1990s, three U.S. agencies—State, DOD, and Energy—have provided funding, technical assistance, and equipment to counter the proliferation of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons. Originally aimed at the former Soviet Union under the rubric cooperative threat reduction (CTR), these programs seek to ensure that these weapons are secured and their spread to rogue nations or terrorist groups prevented. In addition to nonproliferation efforts, the Nonproliferation, Anti-Terrorism, Demining and Related Programs (NADR) account, managed by the State Department, encompasses civilian anti-terrorism efforts such as detecting and dismantling terrorist financial networks, establishing watch-list systems at border controls, and building developing country anti-terrorism capacities. NADR also funds humanitarian demining programs. The State Department is the main implementer of counternarcotics programs. The State-managed International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) account supports counternarcotics activities, most notably in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Peru, and Colombia. It also helps develop the judicial systems—assisting judges, lawyers, and legal institutions—of many developing countries, especially in Afghanistan. DOD and USAID also support counternarcotics activities, the former largely by providing training and equipment, the latter by offering alternative crop and employment programs. The United States provides military assistance to U.S. friends and allies to help them acquire U.S. military equipment and training. At $14.5 billion, military assistance accounted for about 29% of total U.S. foreign aid in FY2017. The Department of State administers three programs, with corresponding appropriations accounts that are then implemented by DOD. Foreign Military Financing (FMF) is a grant program that enables governments to receive equipment and associated training from the U.S. government or to access equipment directly through U.S. commercial channels. Most FMF grants support the security needs of Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan, and Iraq. The International Military Education and Training program (IMET) offers military training on a grant basis to foreign military officers and personnel. Peacekeeping funds (PKO) are used to support voluntary non-U.N. peacekeeping operations as well as training for an African crisis response force. Since 2002, DOD appropriations have supported FMF-like programs, training and equipping security forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. These programs and the accounts that fund them are called the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF) and, through FY2012, the Iraq Security Forces Fund (ISFF). Beginning in FY2015, similar support was provided Iraq under the Iraq Train and Equip Fund. The DOD-funded programs in Afghanistan and Iraq accounted for more than half of total military assistance in FY2017. How and in what form assistance reaches an aid recipient can vary widely, depending on the type of aid program, the objective of the assistance, and the agency responsible for providing the aid. Federal agencies may implement foreign assistance programs using funds appropriated directly to them or funds transferred to them from another agency. For example, significant funding appropriated through State Department and Department of Agriculture accounts is used for programs implemented by USAID (see Figure 2 ). The funding data in this section reflect the agency that implemented the aid, not necessarily the agency to which funds were originally appropriated. For 50 years, USAID has implemented the bulk of the U.S. bilateral economic development and humanitarian assistance. It directly implements the Development Assistance, International Disaster Assistance, and Transition Initiatives accounts, as well as a USAID-designated portion of the Global Health account. Jointly with the State Department, USAID co-manages ESF, AEECA, and Democracy Fund programs, which frequently support development activities as a means of promoting U.S. political and strategic goals. Based on historical averages, according to USAID, the agency implements more than 90% of ESF, 70% of AEECA, 40% of the Democracy Fund, and about 60% of the Global HIV/AIDS funding appropriated to the State Department. USAID also implements all Food for Peace Act Title II food assistance funded through agriculture appropriations. USAID obligated an estimated $20.55 billion to implement foreign assistance programs and activities in FY2017. The agency's staff in 2018 totaled 9,747 , of which about 67% were working overseas, overseeing the implementation of hundreds of projects undertaken by thousands of private sector contractors, consultants, and nongovernmental organizations. DOD implements all SFOPS-funded military assistance programs—FMF, IMET, PKO, and PCCF—in conjunction with the policy guidance of the Department of State. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency is the primary DOD body responsible for these programs. DOD also carries out an array of state-building activities, funded through defense appropriations legislation, which are usually in the context of training exercises and military operations. These sorts of activities, once the exclusive jurisdiction of civilian aid agencies, include development assistance to Iraq and Afghanistan through the Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP), the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund, and the Afghanistan Infrastructure Fund, and elsewhere through the Defense Health Program, counterdrug activities, and humanitarian and disaster relief. Training and equipping of Iraqi and Afghan police and military, though similar in nature to some traditional security assistance programs, has been funded and implemented primarily through DOD appropriations, though implementing the Iraq police training program was a State Department responsibility from 2012 until it was phased out in 2013. In FY2017, the Department of Defense implemented an estimated $14.50 billion in foreign assistance programs. The Department of State manages and co-manages a wide range of assistance programs. It is the lead U.S. civilian agency on security and refugee related assistance, and has sole responsibility for implementing the International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INCLE) and Nonproliferation, Antiterror, and Demining (NADR) accounts, the two Migration and Refugee accounts (MRA and ERMA), and the International Organizations and Programs (IO&P) account. State is also home to the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC), which manages the State Department's portion of Global Health funding in support of HIV/AIDS programs, though many of these funds are transferred to and implemented by USAID, the National Institutes of Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In conjunction with USAID, the State Department manages the Economic Support Fund, AEECA assistance to the former communist states, and Democracy Fund accounts. For these accounts, the State Department largely sets the overall policy and direction of funds, while USAID implements the preponderance of programs. In addition, the State Department, through its Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, has policy authority over the Foreign Military Financing (FMF), International Military Education and Training (IMET), and Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) accounts, and, while it was active, the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF). These programs are implemented by the Department of Defense. Police training programs have traditionally been the responsibility of the International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL) Office in the State Department, though programs in Iraq and Afghanistan were implemented and paid for by the Department of Defense for several years. State is also the organizational home to the Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance Resources (formerly the Office of the Director of Foreign Assistance), known as ""F,"" which was created in 2006 to coordinate U.S. foreign assistance programs. The office establishes standard program structures and definitions, as well as performance indicators, and collects and reports data on State Department and USAID aid programs. The State Department implemented about $7.66 billion in foreign assistance funding in FY2017, though it has policy authority over a much broader range of assistance funds. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services implements a range of global health programs through its various component institutions. As an implementing partner in the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (PEPFAR), a large portion of HHS foreign assistance activity is related to HIV prevention and treatment, including technical support and preventing mother to child transmission of HIV/AIDS. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention participates in a broad range of global disease control activity, including rapid outbreak response, global research and surveillance, information technology assistance, and field epidemiology and laboratory training. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) also conduct international health research that is reported as assistance. In FY2017, HHS institutions implemented $2.66 billion in foreign assistance activities. The Department of the Treasury's Under Secretary for International Affairs administers U.S. contributions to and participation in the World Bank and other multilateral development institutions. In this case, the agency manages the distribution of funds to the institutions, but does not implement programs. Presidentially appointed U.S. executive directors at each of the banks represent the United States' point of view. Treasury also deals with foreign debt reduction issues and programs, including U.S. participation in the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, and manages a technical assistance program offering temporary financial advisors to countries implementing major economic reforms and combating terrorist finance activity. For FY2017, the Department of the Treasury managed foreign assistance valued at about $1.85 billion. Created in February 2004, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) seeks to concentrate significantly higher amounts of U.S. resources in a few low- and lower-middle-income countries that have demonstrated a strong commitment to political, economic, and social reforms relative to other developing countries. A significant feature of the MCC effort is that recipient countries formulate, propose, and implement mutually agreed multi-year U.S.-funded project plans known as compacts. Compacts in the 27 recipient countries selected to date have emphasized construction of infrastructure. The MCC is a U.S. government corporation, headed by a chief executive officer who reports to a board of directors chaired by the Secretary of State. The Corporation maintains a relatively small staff of about 300. The MCC obligated about $1.01 billion in FY2017. A number of other government agencies play a role in implementing foreign aid programs. The Peace Corps, an autonomous agency with FY2017 obligations of $445 million, supports about 7,300 volunteers in 65 countries. Peace Corps volunteers work in a wide range of educational, health, and community development projects. The Trade and Development Agency (TDA), which obligated $58 million in FY2017, finances trade missions and feasibility studies for private sector projects likely to generate U.S. exports. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) provides political risk insurance to U.S. companies investing in developing countries and finances projects through loans and guarantees. Its insurance activities have been self-sustaining, but credit reform rules require a relatively small appropriation to back up U.S. guarantees and for administrative expenses. The Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development Act of 2018 (BUILD Act), signed into law in October 2018 ( P.L. 115-254 ), authorized consolidation of OPIC and USAID's Development Credit Authority into a new U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC), which is expected to become operational in fall 2019. For FY2017, as for most prior years, OPIC receipts exceeded appropriations, resulting in a net gain to the Treasury. The Inter-American Foundation and the African Development Foundation, obligating $25.8 million and $20.2 million, respectively, in FY2017, finance small-scale enterprise and grassroots self-help activities aimed at assisting poor people. Most U.S. assistance is now provided as a grant (gift) rather than a loan, so as not to increase the heavy debt burden carried by many developing countries. However, the forms a grant may take are diverse. The most common type of U.S. development aid is project-based assistance (77% in FY2017), in which aid is channeled through an implementing partner to complete a project. Aid is also provided in the form of core contribution to international organizations such as the United Nations, technical assistance, and direct budget support (cash transfer) to governments. A portion of aid money is also spent on administrative costs ( Figure 3 ). Within these categories, aid may take many forms, as described below. Although it is the exception rather than the rule, some countries receive aid in the form of a cash grant to the government. Dollars provided in this way support a government's balance-of-payments situation, enabling it to purchase more U.S. goods, service its debt, or devote more domestic revenues to developmental or other purposes. Cash transfers have been made as a reward to countries that have supported the United States' counterterrorism operations (Turkey and Jordan in FY2004), to provide political and strategic support (both Egypt and Israel annually for decades after the 1979 Camp David Peace Accord), and in exchange for undertaking difficult political and economic reforms. Assistance may be provided in the form of food commodities, weapons systems, or equipment such as generators or computers. Food aid may be provided directly to meet humanitarian needs or to encourage attendance at a maternal/child health care program. Weapons supplied under the military assistance program may include training in their use. Equipment and commodities provided under development assistance are usually integrated with other forms of aid to meet objectives in a particular social or economic sector. For instance, textbooks have been provided in both Afghanistan and Iraq as part of a broader effort to reform the educational sector and train teachers. Computers may be offered in conjunction with training and expertise to fledgling microcredit institutions. Since PEPFAR was first authorized in 2004, antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) provided to individuals living with HIV/AIDS have been a significant component of commodity-based assistance. Although once a significant portion of U.S. assistance programs, construction of economic infrastructure—roads, irrigation systems, electric power facilities, etc.—was rarely provided after the 1970s. Because of the substantial expense of these projects, they were to be found only in large assistance programs, such as that for Egypt in the 1980s and 1990s, where the United States constructed major urban water and sanitation systems. The aid programs in Iraq and Afghanistan supported the building of schools, health clinics, roads, power plants, and irrigation systems. In Iraq alone, more than $10 billion went to economic infrastructure. Economic infrastructure is now also supported by U.S. assistance in a wider range of developing countries through the Millennium Challenge Corporation. In this case, recipient countries design their own assistance programs, most of which, to date, include an infrastructure component. Transfer of knowledge and skills is a significant part of most assistance programs. The International Military Education and Training Program (IMET) provides training to officers of the military forces of allied and friendly nations. Tens of thousands of citizens of aid recipient countries receive short-term technical training or longer-term degree training annually under USAID programs. More than one-quarter of Peace Corps volunteers are English, math, and science teachers. Other aid programs provide law enforcement personnel with anti-narcotics or anti-terrorism training. Many assistance programs provide expert advice to government and private sector organizations. The Department of the Treasury, USAID, and U.S.-funded multilateral banks all place specialists in host government ministries to make recommendations on policy reforms in a wide variety of sectors. USAID has often placed experts in private sector business and civic organizations to help strengthen them in their formative years or while indigenous staff are being trained. While most of these experts are U.S. nationals, in Russia, USAID funded the development of locally staffed political and economic think tanks to offer policy options to that government. USAID, the Inter-American Foundation, and the African Development Foundation often provide aid in the form of small grants directly to local organizations to foster economic and social development and to encourage civic engagement in their communities. Grants are sometimes provided to microcredit organizations, such village-level women's savings groups, which in turn provide loans to microentrepreneurs. Small grants may also address specific community needs. Recent IAF grants, for example, have supported organizations that help resettle Salvadoran migrants deported from the United States and youth programs in Central America aimed at gang prevention. Under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the President may determine the terms and conditions under which most forms of assistance are provided. In general, the financial condition of a country—its ability to meet repayment obligations—has been an important criterion of the decision to provide a loan or grant. Some programs, such as humanitarian and disaster relief programs, were designed from the beginning to be entirely grant activities. During the past two decades, nearly all foreign aid—military as well as economic—has been provided in grant form. While loans represented 32% of total military and economic assistance between 1962 and 1988, this figure declined substantially beginning in the mid-1980s, until by FY2001, loans represented less than 1% of total aid appropriations. The de-emphasis on loan programs came largely in response to the debt problems of developing countries. Both Congress and the executive branch have generally supported the view that foreign aid should not add to the already existing debt burden carried by these countries. In the FY2019 budget request, the Trump Administration encouraged the use of loans over grants when providing military assistance (Foreign Military Financing), but Congress did not include language in support of that proposal in the enacted FY2019 appropriation ( P.L. 116-6 ). Although a small proportion of total current aid, there are significant USAID-managed programs that guarantee loans, meaning the U.S. government agrees to pay a portion of the amount owed in the case of a default on a loan. A Development Credit Authority (DCA) loan guarantee, in which risk is shared with a private sector bank, can be used to increase access to finance in support of any development sector. The DCA is to be transferred from USAID in 2019 to the new IDFC, established by the BUILD Act of 2018 ( P.L. 115-254 ), to enhance U.S. development finance capacity. Under the Israeli Loan Guarantee Program, the United States has guaranteed repayment of loans made by commercial sources to support the costs of immigrants settling in Israel from other countries and may issue guarantees to support economic recovery. USAID has also provided loan guarantees in recent years to improve the terms or amounts of financing from international capital markets for Ukraine and Jordan. In these cases, assistance funds representing a fraction of the guarantee amount are provided to cover possible default. Between 1946 and 2016, the United States loaned $112.7 billion in foreign economic and military aid to foreign governments, and while most foreign aid is now provided through grants, $9.18 billion in loans to foreign governments remained outstanding at the end of FY2016. For nearly three decades, Section 620q of the Foreign Assistance Act (the Brooke amendment) has prohibited new assistance to the government of any country that falls more than one year past due in servicing its debt obligations to the United States, though the President may waive application of this prohibition if he determines it is in the national interest. The United States has also forgiven debts owed by foreign governments and encouraged, with mixed success, other foreign aid donors and international financial institutions to do likewise. In some cases, the decision to forgive foreign aid debts has been based largely on economic grounds as another means to support development efforts by heavily indebted, but reform-minded, countries. The United States has been one of the strongest supporters of the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). These initiatives, which began in the late 1990s, include participation of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and other international financial institutions in a comprehensive debt workout framework for the world's poorest and most debt-strapped nations. The largest and most hotly debated debt forgiveness actions have been implemented for much broader foreign policy reasons with a more strategic purpose. Poland, during its transition from a communist system and centrally planned economy (1990—$2.46 billion); Egypt, for making peace with Israel and helping maintain the Arab coalition during the Persian Gulf War (1990—$7 billion); and Jordan, after signing a peace accord with Israel (1994—$700 million), are examples. Similarly, the United States forgave about $4.1 billion in outstanding Saddam Hussein-era Iraqi debt in November 2004 and helped negotiate an 80% reduction in Iraq's debt to creditor nations later that month. Most development and humanitarian assistance activities are not directly implemented by U.S. government personnel but by private sector entities, such as individual personal service contractors, consulting firms, universities, private voluntary organizations (PVOs), or public international organizations (PIOs). Generally speaking, U.S. government foreign service and civil servants determine the direction and priorities of the aid program, allocate funds while keeping within legislative requirements, ensure that appropriate projects are in place to meet aid objectives, select implementers, and monitor the implementation of those projects for effectiveness and financial accountability. Both USAID and the State Department have promoted the use of public-private partnerships, in which private entities such as corporations and foundations are contributing partners, not paid implementers, in situations where business interests and development objectives coincide. In FY2017, the United States provided some form of bilateral foreign assistance to more than 150 countries. Aid is concentrated heavily in certain countries, reflecting the priorities and interests of United States foreign policy at the time. Table 2 identifies the top 15 recipients of U.S. foreign assistance for FY1997, FY2007 and FY2017. As shown in the table above, there are both similarities and sharp differences among country aid recipients for the three periods. The most consistent thread connecting the top aid recipients over the past two decades has been continuing U.S. strategic interests in the Middle East, with large programs maintained for Israel and Egypt and, for Iraq, following the 2003 invasion. Two key countries in the U.S. counterterrorism strategy, Afghanistan and Pakistan, made their first appearances on the list in FY2002 and continued to be among the top recipients in FY2017. In FY1997, one sub-Saharan African country appeared among leading aid recipients; in FY2017, 7 of the 15 are sub-Saharan African. Many are focus countries under the PEPFAR initiative to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic; South Sudan receives support as a newly independent country with multiple humanitarian and development needs. In FY1997, three countries from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union made the list, as many from the region had for much of the 1990s, representing the effort to transform the former communist nations to democratic societies and market-oriented economies. None of those countries appear in the FY2017 list. In FY1997, four Latin American countries make the list; no countries from the region appear in FY2017. On a regional basis, the Middle East/North Africa (MENA) region has received the largest share of U.S. foreign assistance for many decades. Although economic aid to the region's top two recipients, Israel and Egypt, began to decline in the late 1990s, the dominant share of bilateral U.S. assistance consumed by the MENA region was maintained in FY2005 by the war in Iraq. Despite the continued importance of the region, its share slipped substantially by FY2017 as the effort to train and equip Iraqi forces diminished. Since September 11, 2001, South and Central Asia has emerged as a significant target of U.S. assistance, rising from a roughly 3% share 20 years ago to 16% in FY2007 and 15% in FY2017, largely because of aid to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Similarly, the share represented by African nations has increased from 10% and 19%, respectively, in FY1997 and FY2007, to 25% in FY2017, largely due to the HIV/AIDS initiative that funnels resources mostly to African countries and to a range of other efforts to address the region's development challenges. Meanwhile, the share of aid to Europe/Eurasia, which greatly surpassed that of Africa in FY1997, has declined significantly in the past decade, to about 4% in FY2017, with the graduation of many East European aid recipients and the termination of programs in Russia. The Ukraine was responsible for about one third of aid to that region in FY2017. East Asia/Pacific has remained at a low level during the past two decades, while Latin America's share has risen and fallen based on U.S. interest in Colombia and a few Central American countries as aid has shifted to regions of more pressing strategic interest (see Figure 4 ). There are several methods commonly used for measuring the amount of federal spending on foreign assistance. Amounts can be expressed in terms of budget authority (funds appropriated by Congress), obligations (amounts contractually committed), outlays or disbursements (money actually spent). Assistance levels are also sometimes measured as a percentage of the total federal budget, as a percentage of total discretionary budget authority (excluding mandatory and entitlement programs), or as a percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP) (for an indication of the national wealth allocated to foreign aid). By nearly all of these measures, foreign aid resources fell gradually on average over several decades since the historical high levels of the late 1940s and early 1950s ( Appendix A ). This downward trend was sporadically interrupted, largely due to major foreign policy initiatives such as the Alliance for Progress for Latin America beginning in 1961, the infusion of funds to implement the Camp David Middle East Peace Accords in 1979, and an increase in military assistance to Egypt, Turkey, Greece and others in the mid-1980s. The lowest point in U.S. foreign aid spending since World War II came in 1997, when foreign assistance obligations fell to just above $20 billion (in 2017 dollar terms). ( Figure 5 ) While foreign aid consistently represented just over 1% of U.S. annual gross domestic product in the decade following World War II, it fell gradually to between 0.2% and 0.4% for most years in the past three decades. Foreign assistance spending has comprised, on average, around 3% of discretionary budget authority and just over 1% of total budget authority each year since 1977, though the percentages have sometimes varied considerably from year to year. Foreign aid dropped from 5% of discretionary budget authority in 1979 to 2.4% in 2001, before rising sharply in conjunction with U.S. activities in Afghanistan and Iraq starting in 2003. As a portion of total budget authority, foreign assistance reached 2.5% in 1979, but has hovered below 1.5% since 1987. In 2017, foreign assistance was estimated to account for 4.1% of discretionary budget authority and 1.2% of total budget authority ( Figure 6 ; Appendix A ). As previously discussed, since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, foreign aid funding has been closely tied to U.S. counterterrorism strategy, particularly in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Bush and Obama Administration global health initiatives, the creation of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, and growth in counter-narcotics activities have driven funding increases as well. The Budget Control Act of 2011, and the drawdown of U.S. military forces in Iraq, and to some degree Afghanistan, led to a notable dip in aid obligations in FY2013, but aid levels have risen again with efforts to address the crisis in Syria, counter-ISIL activities, and humanitarian aid. The use of the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO, discussed below) designation has enabled this growth despite the BCA limitations. Figure 7 shows how trends in foreign aid funding in recent decades can be attributed to specific foreign policy events and presidential initiatives. The Obama Administration's FY2012 international affairs budget proposed that the overseas contingency operations (OCO) designation, which had been applied since 2009 to war-related Defense appropriations, including to DOD assistance programs such as ISFF, ASFF and CERP, be extended to include ""extraordinary, but temporary, costs of the Department of State and USAID in the front line states of Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan."" Congress not only adopted the OCO designation in the FY2012 SFOPS appropriations legislation, but expanded it to include funding for additional accounts and countries. In every fiscal year since, a portion of certain foreign assistance accounts—primarily ESF, FMF, IDA, MRA and INCLE—has been appropriated with the OCO designation. The OCO designation is significant because the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), which set annual caps on discretionary funding from FY2013 through FY2021, specified that funds designated as OCO do not count toward the discretionary spending limits established by the act. OCO designation makes it possible to prevent war-related funding from crowding out core international affairs activities within the budget allocation. The OCO approach is reminiscent of the use of supplemental international affairs appropriations for the first decade after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Congress appropriated significant emergency supplemental funds for foreign operations and Defense assistance programs every year from FY2002 through FY2010 for activities in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, which were not counted toward subcommittee budget allocations. Since the OCO designation was first applied to foreign operations in FY2012, supplemental appropriations for foreign aid have declined significantly. In the FY2019 and FY2020 budget requests, the Trump Administration did not request OCO funding within the international affairs budget, but did request OCO funding for the Department of Defense, including for DOD aid accounts. Congress used the OCO designation for both DOD and State/USAID accounts in the FY2019 appropriation, P.L. 116-6 , but a smaller portion of aid was designated as OCO compared to FY2018. It remains to be seen whether this is the beginning of a downward trend in OCO use for foreign aid. Congress historically sought to enhance the domestic benefits of foreign aid by requiring that most U.S. foreign aid be used to procure U.S. goods and services. The conditioning of aid on the procurement of goods and services from the donor-country is sometimes called ""tied aid,"" and while quite common for much of the history of modern foreign assistance, has become increasingly disfavored in the international community. Studies have shown that tying aid increases the costs of goods and services by 15%-30% on average, and up to 40% for food aid, reducing the overall effectiveness of aid flows. The United States joined other donor nations in committing to reduce tied aid in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness in March 2005, and the portion of tied aid from all donors fell from 70% of total bilateral development assistance in 1985 to an average of 12% in 2016. However, an estimated 32% of U.S. bilateral development assistance was tied in 2016, the highest percentage among major donors, perhaps reflecting the perception of policymakers that maintaining public and political support for foreign aid programs requires ensuring direct economic benefit to the United States. About 67% of U.S. foreign assistance funds in FY2017 were obligated to U.S.-based entities. A considerable amount of U.S. foreign assistance funds remain in the United States, through domestic procurement or the use of U.S. implementers, but the portion differs by program and is hard to identify with any accuracy. For some types of aid, the legislative requirements or program design make it relatively easy to determine how much aid is spent on U.S. goods or services, while for others, this is more difficult to determine. USAID. Most USAID funding (Development Assistance, Global Health, Economic Support Fund) is implemented through contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements with implementing partners. While many implementing partner organizations are based in the United States and employ U.S. citizens, there is little information available about what portion of the funds used for program implementation are used for goods and services provided by American firms. Procurement reform efforts initiated by USAID in 2010 have aimed to increase procurement and implementation by host country entities as a means to enhance country ownership, build local capacity, and improve sustainability of aid programs. Food assistance commodities, until recently, were purchased wholly in the United States, and generally required by law to be shipped by U.S. carriers, suggesting that the vast majority of food aid expenditures are made in the United States. Starting in FY2009, a small portion of food assistance was authorized to be purchased locally and regionally to meet urgent food needs more quickly. Successive Administrations and several Members of Congress have proposed greater flexibility in the food aid program, potentially increasing aid efficiency but reducing the portion of funds flowing to U.S. farmers and shippers. To date, these proposals have been largely unsuccessful. Foreign Military Financing , with the exception of certain assistance allocated to Israel, is used exclusively to procure U.S. military equipment and training. Millennium Challenge Corporation. The MCC bases its procurement regulations on those established by the World Bank, which calls for an open and competitive process, with no preference given to donor country suppliers. Between FY2011 and FY2017, the MCC awarded roughly 15% of the value of compact contracts to U.S. firms. Multilateral development aid. Multilateral aid funds are mixed with funds from other nations and the bulk of the program is financed with borrowed funds rather than direct government contributions. Information on the U.S. share of procurement financed by MDBs is unavailable. In addition to the direct benefits derived from aid dollars used for American goods and services, many argue that the foreign aid program brings significant indirect financial benefits to the United States. For example, analysts maintain that provision of military equipment through the military assistance program and food commodities through the Food for Peace program helps to develop future, strictly commercial, markets for those products. More broadly, as countries develop economically, they are in a position to purchase more goods from abroad and the United States benefits as a trade partner. Since an increasing majority of global consumers are outside of the United States, some business leaders assert that establishing strong economic and trade ties in the developing world, using foreign assistance as a tool, is key to U.S. economic and job growth. Since World War II, with the exception of several years between 1989 and 2001, during which Japan ranked first among aid donors, the United States has led the developed countries in net disbursements of economic aid, or ""Official Development Assistance (ODA)"" as defined by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC). In 2017, the most recent year for which data are available, the United States disbursed $34.12 billion in ODA, or about 24% of the $144.71 billion in total net ODA disbursements by DAC donors that year. Germany ranked second at $24.16 billion, the United Kingdom followed at $18.59 billion, Japan ranked fourth at $11.85 billion, and France rounded out the top donors with $11.03 billion in 2017 (see Figure 8 ). While the top five donors have not varied for more than a decade, there have been shifts lower down the ranking. For example, Turkey has become a much more prominent ODA donor in recent years (ranked 6 th in 2017, with $9.08 billion in ODA, compared to 21 st in 2006), reflecting large amounts of humanitarian aid to assist Syrian refugees. Even as it leads in dollar amounts of aid flows to developing countries, the United States often ranks low when aid is calculated as a percentage of gross national income (GNI). This calculation is often cited in the context of international donor forums, as a level of 0.7% GNI was established as a target for donors in the 2000 U.N. Millennium Development Goals. In 2017, the United States ranked at the bottom among major donors at 0.18% of GNI, slightly lower than Portugal and Spain (0.18% and 0.19%, respectively). The United Arab Emirates, which has significantly increased its reported ODA in recent years, ranked first among top donors at 1.03% of GNI, followed by Sweden at 1.02% and Luxembourg at 1.00%. There has also been an increase in ODA from non-DAC countries. Between 2000 and 2014, China spent $81.1 billion in ODA, more than tripling its ODA commitments during this period. While reported Chinese ODA is still relatively small compared to that of major donor countries, policymakers are paying increasing attention to growing Chinese investments in developing countries that do not meet the ODA definition. China has touted its ""Belt and Road"" initiative as an effort to boost development and connectivity across as many as 125 countries to create ""strategic propellers"" for its own development. However, China has provided little official aggregate information on the initiative, including on the number of projects, countries involved, the terms of financing, and metrics for success. Numerous congressional authorizing committees and appropriations subcommittees maintain responsibility for U.S. foreign assistance. Several committees have responsibility for authorizing legislation establishing programs and policy and for conducting oversight of foreign aid programs. In the Senate, the Committee on Foreign Relations, and in the House, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, have primary jurisdiction over bilateral development assistance, political/strategic and other economic security assistance, military assistance, and international organizations. Food aid, primarily the responsibility of the Agriculture Committees in both bodies, is periodically shared with the Foreign Affairs Committee in the House. U.S. contributions to multilateral development banks are within the jurisdiction of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Financial Services Committee. The large nontraditional aid programs funded by DOD, such as Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction programs and the military aid programs in Afghanistan and Iraq, come under the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committees. Some global health assistance, such as research and other activities done by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, may fall under the jurisdiction of the House Energy and Commerce and Senate HELP committees. Traditionally, most foreign aid appropriations fall under the jurisdiction of the SFOPS Subcommittees, with food assistance appropriated by the Agriculture Subcommittees. As noted earlier, however, certain military, global health, and other activities that have been reported as foreign aid have been appropriated through other subcommittees in recent years, including the Defense and the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies subcommittees. (For current information on SFOPS Appropriations legislation, see CRS Report R45168, Department of State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs: FY2019 Budget and Appropriations , by Susan B. Epstein, Marian L. Lawson, and Cory R. Gill.) The most significant permanent foreign aid authorization laws are the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, covering most bilateral economic and security assistance programs (P.L. 87-195; 22 U.S.C. 2151); the Arms Export Control Act (1976), authorizing military sales and financing (P.L. 90-629; 22 U.S.C. 2751); the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (P.L. 480), covering food aid (P.L. 83-480; 7 U.S.C. 1691); and the Bretton Woods Agreement Act (1945), authorizing U.S. participation in multilateral development banks (P.L. 79-171; 22 U.S.C. 286). In the past, Congress usually scheduled debates every two years on omnibus foreign aid legislation that amended these permanent authorization measures. Congress has not enacted into law a comprehensive foreign assistance authorization measure since 1985, although foreign aid authorizing bills have passed the House or Senate, or both, on numerous occasions. Foreign aid bills have frequently stalled at some point in the debate because of controversial issues, a tight legislative calendar, or executive-legislative foreign policy disputes. In contrast, DOD assistance is authorized in annual National Defense Authorization legislation. In lieu of approving a broad State Department/USAID authorization bill, Congress has on occasion authorized major foreign assistance initiatives for specific regions, countries, or aid sectors in stand-alone legislation or within an appropriation bill. Among these are the SEED Act of 1989 ( P.L. 101-179 ; 22 U.S.C. 5401); the FREEDOM Support Act of 1992 ( P.L. 102-511 ; 22 U.S.C. 5801); the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 ( P.L. 108-25 ; 22 U.S.C. 7601); the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-293 ); the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003 (Division D, Title VI of P.L. 108-199 ); the Enhanced Partnership With Pakistan Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-73 ; 22 U.S.C. 8401); the Global Food Security Act of 2016 ( P.L. 114-195 ; 22 U.S.C. 9306), and the BUILD Act ( P.L. 115-254 ). In the absence of regular enactment of foreign aid authorization bills, appropriation measures considered annually within the SFOPS spending bill have assumed greater significance for Congress in influencing U.S. foreign aid policy. Not only do appropriations bills set spending levels each year for nearly every foreign assistance account, SFOPS appropriations also incorporate new policy initiatives that would otherwise be debated and enacted as part of authorizing legislation. Appendix A. Data Table Appendix B. Common Foreign Assistance Abbreviations\n\n","['Foreign assistance is the largest component of the international affairs budget and is viewed by many as an essential instrument of U.S. foreign policy. On the basis of national security, commercial, and humanitarian rationales, U.S. assistance flows through many federal agencies and supports myriad objectives. These include promoting economic growth, reducing poverty, improving governance, expanding access to health care and education, promoting stability in conflict regions, countering terrorism, promoting human rights, strengthening allies, and curbing illicit drug production and trafficking. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, foreign aid has increasingly been associated with national security policy. At the same time, many Americans and some Members of Congress view foreign aid as an expense that the United States cannot afford given current budget deficits. In FY2017, U.S. foreign assistance, defined broadly, totaled an estimated $49.87 billion, or 1.2% of total federal budget authority. About 44% of this assistance was for bilateral economic development programs, including political/strategic economic assistance; 35% for military aid and nonmilitary security assistance; 18% for humanitarian activities; and 4% to support the work of multilateral institutions. Assistance can take the form of cash transfers, equipment and commodities, infrastructure, or technical assistance, and, in recent decades, is provided almost exclusively on a grant rather than loan basis. Most U.S. aid is implemented by nongovernmental organizations rather than foreign governments. The United States is the largest foreign aid donor in the world, accounting for about 24% of total official development assistance from major donor governments in 2017 (the latest year for which these data are available). Key foreign assistance trends in the past decade include growth in development aid, particularly global health programs; increased security assistance directed toward U.S. allies in the anti-terrorism effort; and high levels of humanitarian assistance to address a range of crises. Adjusted for inflation, annual foreign assistance funding over the past decade was the highest it has been since the Marshall Plan in the years immediately following World War II. In FY2017, Afghanistan, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, and Egypt received the largest amounts of U.S. aid, reflecting long-standing aid commitments to Israel and Egypt, the strategic significance of Afghanistan and Iraq, and the strategic and humanitarian importance of Jordan as the crisis in neighboring Syria continues. The Near East region received 27% of aid allocated by country or region in FY2017, followed by Africa, at 25%, and South and Central Asia, at 15%. This was a significant shift from a decade prior, when Africa received 19% of aid and the Near East 34%, reflecting significant increases in HIV/AIDS-related programs concentrated in Africa between FY2007 and FY2017 and the drawdown of U.S. military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Military assistance to Iraq began to decline starting in FY2011, but growing concern about the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has reversed this trend. This report provides an overview of the U.S. foreign assistance program by answering frequently asked questions on the subject. It is intended to provide a broad view of foreign assistance over time, and will be updated periodically.

"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nSince its founding in 2006, the National Popular Vote (NPV) initiative has promoted an agreement among the states, an interstate compact that would effectively establish direct popular election of the President and Vice President without a constitutional amendment, while retaining the structure of the electoral college system. The United States is unique among ""presidential"" republics by providing an indirect election to choose its chief executive. The President and Vice President of the United States are selected not by registered voters, but by the electoral college, electors appointed in the states ""in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct.... "" Alexander Hamilton, who was ""present at the creation"" of the Constitution in 1787, commented favorably on the electoral college system in The Federalist : The mode of appointment of the Chief Magistrate of the United States is almost the only part of the system, of any consequence, which has escaped without severe censure, or which has received the slightest mark of approbation from its opponents.... I venture somewhat further, and hesitate not to affirm that if the manner of it be not perfect, it is at least excellent. It unites in an eminent degree all the advantages the union of which was to be wished for. Notwithstanding Hamilton's endorsement, the first proposal to change the electoral college system by constitutional amendment was introduced as early as 1800, and since that time more than 700 proposals to reform or eliminate the college have been introduced in Congress. Reform advocates have long focused on the fact that it does not provide for direct democratic election, that less-populous states are afforded an arithmetical advantage due to the assignment of two electors to each state, regardless of population, and that the winner-take-all system makes it possible for candidates to win an electoral college majority and the presidency, while gaining fewer votes than their principal opponents in the popular election. Between 1949 and 1979, Congress considered amendments to reform the electoral college, or replace it with direct popular election, in committee and on the floor of both chambers. Proposed amendments must, however, meet the requirements of the Constitution's Article V, which calls for two-thirds approval by both houses of Congress, and ratification by three-fourths of the states; to date, no electoral college reform proposal has met these requirements. Proponents of the National Popular Vote initiative contend that their plan will achieve direct popular election while circumventing the requirements of Article V, and will guarantee that the popular vote winners will always be elected President and Vice President. The fundamentals of the electoral college system were established by Article II, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution, and subsequently revised by the Twelfth Amendment. The Constitution's minimal provisions have been complemented over the past two centuries by a range of federal and state laws, political party procedures, and enduring political traditions, leading to the system as it exists today. The salient features of the contemporary system are detailed below. The electors are collectively known as the electoral college; although this phrase does not appear in the Constitution, it gained currency in the early days of the republic, and was recognized in federal law in 1845. The electoral college has no continuing existence; its sole purpose is to elect the President and Vice President. Each state is allocated a number of electors equal to the combined total of its U.S. Senate and House of Representatives delegations. The District of Columbia is also allocated three electors. At present, the total is 538, reflecting the combined size of the Senate (100 Members), the House (435 Members), and the District of Columbia electors. Any person may serve as an elector, except Senators and Representatives, or any other person holding an office of ""trust or profit"" under the United States. Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution empowers the states to ""appoint [electors], in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct.... "" This grant of authority provides the constitutional basis claimed for the NPV initiative. In practice, all states currently provide for popular election of their electoral college delegations. Candidates for the office of elector are nominated by political parties and other groups on the presidential ballot in each state. In most cases, the candidates for the office of elector are nominated by the state party committee or the party's statewide convention. The winning presidential nominees must gain a national majority of 270 or more electoral votes, out of the 538 total, in order to be elected. If no ticket of candidates attains a majority, then the House of Representatives elects the President, and the Senate the Vice President, in a procedure known as contingent election. Candidates for the office of elector are selected by their respective political parties. They are expected to vote for the presidential and vice presidential candidates to whom they are pledged. Some states seek to require them to so vote by law or other means, but most constitutional scholars hold that the electors remain free agents under the Constitution, and that they may vote for any person they choose. On rare occasions, an elector will vote for a different candidate, or abstain from casting a vote for any candidate; he or she is known as a ""faithless elector."" The goal of presidential campaigns under the existing system is to win by carrying states that collectively cast a majority of electoral votes. Political parties and presidential campaigns tend to focus on states that are closely contested (widely referred to as ""battleground"" states), or that have large delegations of electoral votes, or both. Winning a majority of the more populous and/or battleground states is considered crucial to obtaining the necessary electoral vote majority. In 48 states and the District of Columbia, the presidential/vice presidential ticket winning the most popular votes (a plurality or more) in that state is awarded all its electoral votes. That is to say, the winning party's entire ticket of electors is elected. This is referred to as the ""winner-take-all"" or ""general ticket"" system. Presidential Election Day is set by law for Tuesday after the first Monday in November every fourth year succeeding the election of President and Vice President. On Presidential Election Day, voters cast one vote for the candidates they support. They are, however, actually voting for the state political party ""ticket"" of electors supporting those presidential and vice presidential candidates. Presidential electors assemble on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December following the general election. They meet in their respective states, not collectively, and cast separate votes by ballot for the President and Vice President. After the electors vote, the results are sent by the states to Congress and various other federal authorities. On January 6 of the year following a presidential election, Congress meets in a joint session to count the electoral votes and make a formal declaration of which candidates have been elected President and Vice President. A range of factors contributed to the emergence of the National Popular Vote initiative in the first decade of the 21 st century. A major source was frustration by reform advocates after three decades of failed attempts to secure congressional approval for a direct popular election amendment. A more immediate spur was the contentious and disputed presidential election of 2000, which is regarded as having been a major factor contributing to the development of the NPV proposal. One of the factors cited for the emergence of the NPV initiative has been the exacting requirements set by the Constitution for amendments, in this case, a direct popular election constitutional amendment. As noted previously, approval by two-thirds of Members present and voting is required in both houses when Congress proposes an amendment, followed by ratification by three-fourths of the states, 38 at present, usually within a seven-year period specified by Congress. Between 1948 and 1979, Congress debated electoral college reform at length; throughout this time, hundreds of reform proposals were introduced in both chambers. They generally centered on one of two courses: ""end it"" by eliminating the entire electoral college system and establishing direct popular election, or ""mend it"" by reforming its more controversial provisions. Between 1948 and 1979, proposed amendments were the subject of hearings in the Senate and House Judiciary Committees on 17 different occasions, while electoral college reform was debated in the Senate on five occasions and twice in the House during this period. Proposals were approved by the necessary two-thirds majority twice in the Senate and once in the House, but never in the same Congress. Following the 1979 defeat of a direct popular election amendment on the Senate floor, and the retirement or defeat of prominent congressional advocates, the question of electoral college reform largely disappeared from public attention and Congress's legislative agenda. Although Senators and Representatives continued to introduce reform proposals, few received action beyond routine committee referral, and in time, the number of measures introduced dropped to zero. Even after the presidential elections of 2000 and 2016, in which the winner of the electoral vote won fewer popular votes than his opponent (a so-called ""misfire"") , there was little evidence that Congress was prepared to consider an electoral college reform amendment. Proposals to replace the electoral college system with direct popular election continued to be introduced, but in dwindling numbers as the years passed. No proposal for direct popular election was introduced in the 113 th Congress. By comparison, 41 direct popular election or electoral college reform amendments were proposed in the 95 th Congress (1977-1978). Following the 2016 election, however, four constitutional amendments introduced late in the 114 th Congress proposed eliminating the electoral college and replacing it with direct election. To date in the 116 th Congress, three amendments to establish direct popular election by constitutional amendment have been introduced, but no action beyond committee referral has been taken on them. Until recently, survey research findings showed public support for presidential election reform through direct popular election by sizable margins. As early as 1967, the Gallup Poll reported that 58% of respondents supported direct election, compared with 22% who favored retaining the electoral college. More recently, Gallup's 2013 survey recorded that 63% of respondents favored an amendment providing for direct election, while 29% favored retention of the electoral college. Following the 2016 election, however, overall support for direct election was measured at 49% in favor to 47% opposed. It is arguable that the change in public attitudes was influenced by the 2016 election results, in which the Republican nominees won the election with a majority of electoral votes, but fewer popular votes than their Democratic opponents. For instance, Gallup reported a shift to greater support for the electoral college system by respondents who identified themselves as ""Republican"" or ""Lean Republican."" Conversely, already high levels of support for direct popular election among respondents who identified themselves as ""Democratic"" or ""Lean Democratic"" rose still further in the post-2016 election Gallup Poll. To date, CRS has identified one survey that was specifically designed to measure public commitment to the NPV initiative. A March 27, 2019, Politico/Morning Consult poll posed relevant questions on the presidential election process and the NPV compact. The first question, which presented a general outline of the existing electoral college system and the generic alternative of direct popular election, reported that respondents preferred direct election by 50% to 34% for retaining the electoral college, and 16% reporting ""Don't know/No opinion."" The next question explained the proposed NPV compact and asked respondents' preference for NPV or the electoral college method. Although the level of support for NPV was lower than that measured for generic direct popular election, a plurality of respondents to this question favored the ""National Popular Vote Interstate Compact"" by a plurality of 43% in favor, to 33% opposed and 23% who reported ""Don't know/No opinion."" The disputed presidential election of 2000 was arguably a catalyst for new thinking on electoral college reform . Following a closely contested campaign, Republican candidates George W. Bush and Richard Cheney were elected over Democratic nominees Al Gore Jr. and Joseph Lieberman following a bitter dispute over election results in Florida tha t was ultimately decided by the Supreme Court . The high court's decision left Bush and Cheney with a narrow plurality in Florida of 537 popular votes and a similarly narrow electoral college majority of 30 states with 271 electoral votes, while their Democratic opponents took 20 states and the District of Columbia with 266 electoral votes (one District of Columbia elector cast a blank ballot in protest against the outcome) . It was the first election since 1888 in which the candidates elected uncontestably won fewer popular votes than their principal opponents : the Gore / Lieberman Democratic ticket gained 50,992,335 popular votes to 50,455,156 for Bush / Cheney. The se election results generated considerable discontent with the system. Some critics argued for a constitutional amendment, but the 107 th Congress faced a heavy legislative workload throughout this period, which initially included enactment of President George W. Bush's legislative program and was later expanded to urgent responses to the terrorist attacks of September 1 1, 2001 . Rather than focus on the lengthy process associated with consideration of a constitutional amendment, Congress focused on legislati ve remedies. The Help America Vote Act of 2002, passed in response to the numerous irregularities in voting systems and procedures revealed by the 2000 election, mandated election administration reforms and v oting system technology enhancements (funded in part by federal grants to the states) intended to ensure accurate and timely voting and vote tabulation in future elections. In 2016, the presidential election was again won by nominees who gained a majority of electoral votes but fewer popular votes than their major party opponents. Although proposals to amend the Constitution to provide direct popular election were introduced in response to this occurrence late in the 114 th Congress , and again in the 115 th Congress, the 2016 results did not result in the degree of c ontroversy a nd activism that followed the electoral college ""misfire "" of 2000. T he following factor may have contributed to this situation : i n 2000, a shift in Florida's electoral votes from Bush/Cheney to Gore/Lieberman would have changed the election result; by comparison, in 2016, a shift in the state with the closest vote margin, Michigan , would not have altered the election. While the 2000 election's ""misfire"" did not result in consideration of a constitutional amendment, it did prompt considerable study and investigation into new approaches to electoral reform among scholars of the presidential election process and political activists. Law professors Robert W. Bennett of Northwestern University, Vikram Amar of the University of California-Davis, and Akhil Amar of Yale University School of Law are generally credited as the intellectual godparents of the concept that ultimately evolved into the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which relies on the Constitution's broad grant of power to each state to ""appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct [emphasis added], a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress."" Project FairVote, an issue advocacy group self-described as a nonprofit, nonpartisan ""501(c)(4)"" organization, appears to have been an incubator of the NPV concept. FairVote has supported NPV for ""over a decade,"" and was an early supporter of National Popular Vote Inc., the plan's official advocacy group; moreover, longtime FairVote board members Robert Richie and the late Representative John B. Anderson were early supporters of the National Popular Vote initiative and contributors to its manifesto, Every Vote Equal . As noted previously, the NPV initiative was the ultimate result of the various studies and proposals offered following the presidential election of 2000. The NPV initiative seeks to establish direct popular election of the President and Vice President through an interstate compact, rather than by constitutional amendment. Ideally, under the compact's provisions, legislatures of the 50 states and the District of Columbia would pass legislation binding the signatories to appoint presidential electors committed to the presidential/vice presidential ticket that gained the most votes nationwide . If all 50 states and the District of Columbia were compact members, this would deliver a unanimous electoral college decision for the candidates winning a plurality of the popular vote. Specifically, the plan calls for an agreement among the states, an interstate compact effected through state legislation, in which the legislature in each of the participating states agrees to appoint electors pledged to the candidates who won the nationwide popular vote . State election authorities would count and certify the popular vote in each state, which would be aggregated and certified as the ""nationwide popular vote."" The participating state legislatures would then choose the slate of electors pledged to the ""nationwide popular vote winner,"" notwithstanding the results within their particular state s . To ensure success, the initiative would come into effect only if states whose total electoral votes equal or exceed the constitutional majority of 270 were to approve the plan. If the nationwide popular vote were effectively tied, the states would be released from their commitment under the compact, and could choose electors who represented the presidential ticket that gained the most votes in each particular state. One novel NPV provision would enable the presidential candidate who won the national popular vote to fill any vacancies in the electoral college with electors of his or her own choice. States would retain the right to withdraw from the compact, but if a state chose to withdraw within six months of the end of a presidential term, the withdrawal would not be effective until after the succeeding President and Vice President had been elected. The NPV advocacy effort is managed by National Popular Vote Inc., a ""501(c)(4)"" nonprofit corporation established in California in 2006 by Barry Fadem, an attorney specializing in initiative and referendum law, and John R. Koza, Ph.D., an automated systems scientist and entrepreneur. As a 501(c)(4) entity, it is permitted to engage in political activity in furtherance of its goal, without forfeiting its tax-exempt status, so long as this is not its primary activity. NPV states on its website that its ""specific purpose is to study, analyze and educate the public regarding its proposal to implement a nationwide popular election of the President of the United States."" Dr. Koza serves as chairman of NPV Inc., and Mr. Fadem serves as president. NPV's advisory board includes former Senators and Representatives of both major political parties. In 2006, National Popular Vote Inc. published a detailed handbook, Every Vote Equal: A State-Based Plan for Electing the President by National Popular Vote . This publication, in its fourth edition at the time of this writing, provides a detailed account of various issues related to the NPV initiative, including the electoral college, earlier reform efforts, interstate compacts, the text of the proposed compact, a strategy for advancing the initiative, and a 340-page section addressing ""myths about the National Popular Vote Compact."" National Popular Vote Inc. maintains an office in Mountain View, CA. Supporters in various state legislatures began to introduce measures to adopt the interstate compact shortly after NPV's inaugural press conference on February 23, 2006. The NPV Compact has been introduced at various sessions in the legislatures of all 50 states and the Council of the District of Columbia, which performs the functions of a state legislature in the nation's capital, and has received some form of active consideration in 38 states and the D.C. Council. Among other activities, NPV maintains a regular communications program of email newsletters announcing activities and soliciting readers to petition governors and state legislators to support the compact. At the time of this writing, NPV claims that 3,112 state legislators have either sponsored or cast a recorded vote in their respective legislatures for the compact. NPV also claims endorsements from legislators and endorsements by the New York Times , Los Angeles Times , Chicago Sun-Times , Minneapolis Star Tribune , Boston Globe , Miami Herald , and other newspapers. NPV also advocates use of the citizen initiative process where available to enact state adherence to the compact; it asserts that when Article II, Section 1, clause 2 grants authority to the states to appoint ""in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct,"" the authority extends to the states' entire lawmaking process, which in some states includes the proposal and passage of legislation and constitutional amendments through citizen initiative. The citizen initiative approach to the interstate compact, however, has yet to be used at the time of this writing. At the time of this writing, in May 2019, the following 14 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the National Popular Vote Compact. Collectively, they are assigned a total of 189 electoral votes. The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact has been introduced since its inception in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. States that have adopted NPV at the time of this writing are listed in chronological order, by year of adoption, as follows: Hawaii (4 electoral votes), 2008; Illinois (20 electoral votes), 2008; Maryland (10 electoral votes), 2008; New Jersey (14 electoral votes), 2008; Washington (12 electoral votes), 2009; Massachusetts (11 electoral votes), 2010; District of Columbia (3 electoral votes), 2010; Vermont (3 electoral votes), 2011; California (55 electoral votes), 2011; Rhode Island (4 electoral votes), 2013; New York (29 electoral votes), 2014; Connecticut (7 electoral votes), 2018; Colorado (9 electoral votes), 2019; Delaware (3 electoral votes), 2019; and New Mexico (5 electoral votes), 2019. After initial momentum in 2008, when four states joined the compact in one year, NPV made slower progress toward its goal of approval by states accounting for 270 electoral votes. Highlights were California's approval in 2011, which added 55 electoral votes to the tally, and New York's accession to the compact in 2014. Beginning with Connecticut's approval in 2018, followed in 2019 by Colorado, Delaware, and New Mexico, 24 additional electoral votes were added to the NVP count, bringing the total to 189, 70% of the 270 votes needed for NPV to go into effect. By early May 2019, legislation to join the NPV had been introduced in the current session of at least one chamber of the legislature in 14 states that controlled a combined total of 150 electoral votes. As of April 17, the compact had been approved in Nevada by the Assembly (lower chamber of the legislature) and in Oregon by the Senate. Accession by these two states would raise the NPV member total to 202 electoral votes. Conversely, proposals to rescind approval of the NPV Interstate Compact have been introduced in the legislatures of Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Washington, to date; none has been approved. Some observers note that, despite NPV's assertion of bipartisan support, all the jurisdictions that have joined the compact to date could be identified as ""leaning"" Democratic or ""solid"" Democratic in their support of the Democratic Party, as classified by a recent Gallup survey. For instance, 11 of the 14, including California, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, Rhode Island, and Vermont, were found by Gallup to be among the ""most solidly Democratic states in 2017."" Alluding to this fact, one commentator observed that [a]ll the states to have joined so far are very blue. Until some purple states and red states sign on, the compact has little in the way of territory to conquer.... The seven states where President Obama won [in 2012] by the widest margins, along with D.C., have joined. So have three others—New Jersey, Illinois and Washington—where Obama won by at least 15 percentage points. But none below that threshold have done so. The 2016 presidential election results in Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, and New Mexico, the most recent adherents to the NPV compact, arguably confirm this observation—the Democratic candidates won the popular vote in all four states, by margins of between 4.9% in Colorado to 13.7% in Connecticut. On the other hand, several states where the NPV remained under active consideration in 2019—Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, North Carolina, Ohio, and South Carolina—were carried by the Republican presidential ticket in 2016. As the NPV campaign developed momentum in the states, particularly between 2008 and 2011, defenders of the existing arrangements and the electoral college announced measures to promote retention of the electoral college system. In October 2011, the Heritage Foundation, a conservative public policy institute, released a report opposing the NPV compact. That same month, Roll Call reported that the State Government Leadership Foundation, a project of the Republican State Leadership Committee, would begin a campaign to defend the electoral college and counter recent NPV gains. Further activity, however, does not appear to have been undertaken by these groups by the time of this writing. Arguments in support of and opposed to the National Popular Vote proposal resemble those advanced in favor of and against direct popular election of the President. The central issue turns on the question of the asserted simplicity and democratic attractiveness of the direct election idea as compared to a more complex array of factors cited by supporters of the electoral college system. Proponents of the NPV initiative arguably share the philosophical criticism voiced by proponents of direct popular election, who maintain that the electoral college system is intrinsically undemocratic—it provides for ""indirect"" election of the President and Vice President. This, they assert, is an 18 th century anachronism, dating from a time when communications were poor, the literacy rate was much lower, and the nation had yet to develop the durable, sophisticated, and inclusive democratic political system it now enjoys. They maintain that only direct popular election of the President and Vice President is consistent with modern democratic values and practice. Beyond this fundamental challenge, critics cite what they identify as a wide range of technical failings of the electoral college arrangement. Perhaps the most prominent of these is that the electoral college system can result in the election of a President and Vice President who have won the electoral vote, but gained fewer popular votes than their major opponent. This condition results at least in part from the nearly universal reliance on the ""winner-take-all"" or general ticket system of awarding electoral votes in the states, which is also criticized by NPV advocates. Under the general ticket system, the candidates winning the most popular votes in a state (a plurality is sufficient) are awarded all that state's electors and electoral votes; under these circumstances, a presidential ticket can gain all of a state's electoral votes on even a slim margin of popular votes. Presidents were elected in 1876, 1888, 2000, and 2016 who received fewer popular votes than their major party opponents, while the runner-up in both popular and electoral votes was elected by the House of Representatives when four candidates split the vote in the presidential election of 1824. NPV supporters advocate the compact on the grounds of fairness and respect for the voters' choice. At the core of their arguments, they assert that the process would be simple, national, and democratic; the NPV interstate compact would provide de facto for a single, democratic choice, allowing all the nation's voters to choose the President and Vice President directly, with no intermediaries. The ""people's choice,"" they assert, would win in every election, and every vote would carry the same weight in the election, no matter where in the nation it was cast. No state would be advantaged, nor would any be disadvantaged. According to NPV, the central argument in favor is that the compact ""would guarantee the Presidency to the candidate who receives the most popular votes [or at least a plurality] in all 50 states (and the District of Columbia)."" According to NPV, there would never again be a presidential election ""misfire"" or another ""wrong winner."" Other elements of the electoral college system criticized by NPV advocates (and other electoral college reformers) would arguably disappear or be rendered irrelevant. These include the faithless elector phenomenon, the general ticket system's asserted ""disfranchisement"" of voters who backed the losing candidates, and various asserted ""voting power"" advantages attributed to large (populous) states, small states, states with large populations of noncitizens, states with low rates of voter participation, and populous states with concentrations of minority-group voters. In addition, the NPV compact would almost certainly eliminate the need for contingent election of the President and Vice President under the Twelfth Amendment. NPV advocates also assert the compact would provide a practical benefit to states that tend to be noncompetitive in presidential elections and which therefore receive fewer campaign visits by major party candidates. With ""every vote equal,"" NPV maintains that presidential and vice presidential nominees and their organizations would need to spread their presence and resources more evenly as they campaigned for every vote nationwide, rather than concentrate on winning key ""battleground"" states. They assert that, under the present system candidates have no reason to poll, visit, organize, campaign, or worry about the concerns of voters of states that they cannot possibly win or lose. This means that voters in two thirds of the states are effectively disenfranchised in presidential elections because candidates concentrate their attention on a small handful of ""battleground"" states. In 2004, candidates concentrated over two-thirds of their money and campaign visits in just five states; over 80% in nine states, and over 99% of their money in just 16 states. For instance, NPV notes that California voters seldom see the presidential or vice presidential nominees or benefit from campaign spending because the Golden State, having voted Democratic since 1988, is considered to be reliably ""blue,"" and Democratic Party candidates are said to take its 55 electoral votes for granted. They also note that Republican candidates make few California appearances, but, NPV asserts, for the opposite reason: why spend time and resources in support of an apparently hopeless cause? Similar arguments made by NPV on the Republican side apply to Texas, a state that has voted for Republican presidential nominees since 1980. In 2016 for instance, NPV claims that no Democratic nominee participated in a general election campaign event in California or Texas, while a Republican nominee appeared in only one campaign event in each of those states. By comparison, according to their calculations, the hotly contested battleground states of Florida, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania received, respectively, 71, 55, and 54 candidate appearances. According to NPV's analysis of campaign appearances, the 2016 major party candidates for President and Vice President appeared at a total of 375 campaign events during the general election campaign, but they visited only 12 states; by NPV's calculation, 38 states and the District of Columbia were bypassed during the campaign. NPV advocates also maintain that the concentration of campaign resources, advertising, and candidate appearances in battleground states depresses turnout in ""flyover"" states, where candidates make few campaign appearances. The U.S. Elections Project report, America Goes to the Polls, 2016 , appears to offer statistics consistent with this assertion, finding that the participation rate of the population eligible to vote in 14 battleground states was 65% in the 2016 presidential election, as opposed to comparable nationwide turnout of 60%. It also reports findings similar to those advanced by NPV: 95% of campaign visits during the 2016 campaign were made in battleground states, as was 99% of ""ad spending."" The NPV manifesto also cites a Brookings Institution study of the 2004 presidential election in support of its argument, stating, ""Because the electoral college has effectively narrowed elections like the last one to a quadrennial contest for the votes of a relatively small number of states, people elsewhere are likely to feel that their votes don't matter."" It should be noted, however, that a range of other political, social, cultural, and economic factors may also contribute to the disparity in turnout between battleground and non-battleground states. NPV further suggests that the disparity in participation may ultimately damage the ability to govern on the state and local levels and could have a negative impact on the legitimacy of public institutions: Diminished voter turnout in presidential races in non-battleground states weakens down-ballot candidates, thereby making the state even less competitive in the future. Governance—not just electioneering—is affected by the winner-take-all rule. National Popular Vote opponents oppose the compact on various grounds. Some argue that it is unconstitutional or ""anticonstitutional,"" that is, contrary to the Founders' intentions and the spirit of the nation's fundamental charter. It is also asserted that NPV would solve few of the electoral college system's alleged problem issues and would create some of its own. Finally, some observers note that the NPV compact is an interstate compact as defined in Article I, Section 10, clause 3 of the Constitution, and as such would be subject to congressional approval. This issue is examined in greater detail in a separate section of this report. On the most fundamental philosophical basis, opponents might argue that the NPV compact violates one of the basic principles of majoritarian democracy: it does not require that candidates win a majority of the popular vote in order to gain the presidency. Rather, it would anoint as winner the ticket that gains more popular votes than any other. A majoritarian democracy, it may be argued, should require a majority in order to elect; it may be further noted that the existing system, by comparison, requires a majority in the electoral college. As one commentary noted only the strictest of majoritarians desire a purely majoritarian presidential election system, and those individuals should be deeply troubled by the prospect of plurality presidencies, which the NPVC [sic] expressly countenances. Indeed, the NPVC promises to create more difficulties and ""misfires"" in its own way than the Electoral College system its proponents so earnestly seek to replace. Further, opponents might ask how the NPV compact would function in the event of a multicandidate election, a phenomenon that recurs from time to time in U.S. presidential elections. One commentator posited the following problematic scenario under such circumstances: Under the compact, one can easily imagine a multi-candidate race in which a candidate would win, say, a thirty-four percent plurality of the popular vote nationwide while losing in every state and D.C. If all of the states and D.C. were signatories to the compact, all the electoral votes in such a hypothetical race would be awarded contrary to the will of voters choosing electors (still not voting directly for President under this plan). Would the United States accept a President who wasn't the choice of sixty-six percent of those voting, nor even the choice of a single state? The existing electoral college system, NPV skeptics might also assert, is a fundamental element in the federal constitutional arrangements established by the Constitution. Fearing ""the tyranny of the majority,"" the Founders established a system of government that provides checks and balances designed to restrain the majority and secure minority rights. These principles are also embedded in the structure of federal elections: the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the presidency were deliberately provided with different terms of office and different electorates, and the states were given an important role in the federal election process. In particular, through the electoral college the United States elects its national Presidents and Vice Presidents in a state-based federal election. Successful nominees are compelled under this system to present a broad political vision that commands nation-spanning ""concurrent majorities"" and appeals to the great variety of Americans. As in the case of the Senate, less populous states are accorded a small numerical advantage by assignment of two at-large electors reflecting the Constitution's equal apportionment of Senators to each state regardless of its population. The NPV initiative, they could claim, would discard the Founders' intentions in favor of what they consider to be a flawed ""majoritarian"" presidency that would ill-serve a continent-spanning and profoundly diverse republic. Another criticism centers on the use of the NPV compact to effect a fundamental change in the presidential election process and a de facto amendment to the Constitution, but without following the procedures set out in Article V. Critics may note that NPV's founders admit their plan is an ""end run"" around the Constitution. Proponents might counter with the argument that Article V presents too high a hurdle for what they consider a necessary reform of the system. Opponents, however, could respond that the Founders intended the various supermajority requirements in Congress and the states to ensure that successful constitutional amendments enjoy broad national support. The bare majority of electoral votes required to implement NPV, they might note, meets none of these supermajority requirements. As one study critical of the NPV initiative concluded, because the use of an interstate compact ""does not conform to the constitutional means of changing the original decisions of the Framers, NPV could not [therefore] be a legitimate innovation."" A final argument on this line might be that one ""end run"" around the amendment process might lead to others, setting a dangerous precedent for similar efforts in the future. Opponents might note that the NPV would eliminate the electoral college system's multiplier effect generated by the winner-take-all or general ticket system used in 48 states and the District of Columbia, which tends to magnify the winning ticket's margin of victory, and is said to confer greater legitimacy to the victors. For instance, in 2016, Republican nominee Donald Trump's clear electoral vote majority of 304 votes (56.5% of the total), compared with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's 227 (42.2% of the total) could be said to reinforce and confirm his victory, notwithstanding Clinton's plurality of the popular vote (48.2%), compared with Trump's 46.1%. From a practical standpoint, NPV opponents might argue that the NPV would actually lead to an increase in contested election results and legal challenges in the states, as the political parties maneuver to claim every possible vote. They assert that the existing tabulation of popular votes within each state reduces contested results and recounts. Under NPV, the incentive to gain every vote would arguably lead to far broader disputes and widespread recounts at every level of election administration. As a Heritage Foundation study concluded Under the NPV … any suspicions necessitating a recount in even a single district would be an incentive for a national recount.... The prospect of a candidate challenging ""every precinct, in every county, in every state of the Union"" should be abhorrent to anyone who witnessed the drama, cost, delay, and undue litigation sparked by the Florida recount of 2000. Opponents might also assert that the increased incidence of recounts would be further complicated by wide-ranging disparities in state procedures, potentially leading to prolonged periods of uncertainty following close presidential elections. Critics may also note that the NPV plan contains no ""statute of limitations,"" unlike proposed constitutional amendments, for which Congress typically sets a seven-year ratification period. Where, critics may ask, is a similar time limit that would ""sunset"" the NPV compact, after which it would expire or return to ""square one""? According to its website, NPV was launched on February 23, 2006; if it were a constitutional amendment proposed by Congress, it would have expired on February 23, 2013, since by the end of the customary seven-year deadline it was ""ratified"" by only eight states and the District of Columbia. By what reasoning, they might ask, should the NPV be exempt from the standards of timeliness and contemporaneity Congress customarily sets for constitutional amendments? Opponents might reject claims that, under NPV, campaign spending and candidate appearances would be spread and scheduled more widely, beyond the current concentration of time and resources in battleground states. They might argue that spreading campaign resources and candidate events in non-battleground states is a questionable argument to justify a fundamental change in the presidential election process. Campaign appearances and spending, they could assert, should not be considered to be a local economic stimulus package, nor are the amounts in question sufficient to make much of a difference in the economic condition of most states. As one critical analysis notes, ""... the nation does not hold presidential elections to foster local economic development."" Moreover, they might continue, it is equally dubious to assert that nominees will slight the concerns of citizens of the non-battleground states from which they draw their greatest support, or that concentrated campaigning in the battleground states somehow ""disenfranchises"" voters in others. In the modern era, a small percentage of voters actually attends an in-person presidential or vice presidential candidate appearance. Television (especially broadcast and cable TV news networks), social media, the internet, and newspapers—not the traditional rallies, torchlight parades, and handbills—dominate presidential election campaigns in the 21 st century. In addition to policy issues discussed previously, some observers have also raised questions related to the NPV initiative based on the fact that it is an interstate compact as defined in the Constitution. Others have questioned whether NPV might conflict with some provisions of the Voting Rights Act. The NPV initiative has been described by its supporters variously as a bill, a state-level statute, and an interstate compact. The latter reference necessitates an analysis of whether the initiative complies with the Compact Clause of the Constitution. An interstate compact—under the broadest understanding—is a contract between two or more consenting states. The Supreme Court has further suggested that an interstate compact often requires reciprocal commitments between the governments of two or more states, such that one state's commitment is conditioned on the action of another state and no state can unilaterally repeal its commitment. The use of interstate compacts predates the Constitution, as the Articles of Confederation contained a similar Compact Clause that provided a qualified prohibition on states entering into any agreements between them without the consent of Congress. The chaos resulting from the disunity created by the Articles of Confederation prompted the Framers of the Constitution generally to ""impose more uniformity"" among the states, resulting in a Constitution that wholly prohibits states from entering into any treaties, alliances, and federations. Nonetheless, the Constitution maintained the Articles of Confederation's qualified prohibition on interstate compacts and agreements, allowing states to enter into an interstate compact so long as the participating states seek the consent of Congress. Specifically, the Compact Clause provides that ""No State shall, without the Consent of Congress ... enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State.... "" While the historical rationale for Article I's qualified prohibition on interstate compacts is unclear, the Compact Clause generally reflects the view of the Framers that states should be able to work cooperatively together, as well as the concern that unchecked interstate alliances might threaten the harmony of the Union or the authority vested by the Constitution in the federal government. As the Supreme Court noted in Cuyler v. Adams , ""By vesting in Congress the power to grant or withhold consent, or to condition consent on the states' compliance with specified conditions, the Framers sought to ensure that Congress would maintain ultimate supervisory power over cooperative state action that might otherwise interfere with the full and free exercise of federal authority."" The Compact Clause places no limits on what might be done through an interstate compact other than the requirement of congressional consent. In the early years of government under the Constitution, compacts were used almost exclusively to settle boundary disputes. Beginning with the establishment of the Port of New York Authority in 1921, however, compacts began to be used to address more complex, regional issues requiring intergovernmental cooperation. Some compacts are merely advisory in form, but others may be regulatory, with significant powers granted to multistate commissions. More recently, compacts have addressed such wide-ranging concerns as mental health treatment, law enforcement and crime control, education, driver licensing and enforcement, environmental conservation, energy, nuclear waste control, facilities operations, transportation, economic development, insurance regulation, placement of children and juveniles, disaster assistance, and pollution control. Approximately 200 interstate compacts are in effect today. Accordingly, the central legal issue with respect to the Compact Clause is whether a given interstate compact requires the consent of Congress. While a ""literal"" reading of the Compact Clause ""would require the States to obtain congressional approval before entering into any agreement among themselves, irrespective of form, subject, duration, or interest to the United States [emphasis added],"" the Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected such a reading. In 1893, in Virginia v. Tenness e e , Justice Stephen Field, writing for the Court, contended that a broad reading of the Compact Clause would ""embrace all forms of stipulation, written or verbal, and relating to all kinds of subjects[,]"" requiring congressional consent to agreements ""which the United States can have no possible objection or have any interest in interfering with,"" as well as those that ""may tend to increase ... the political influence of the contracting states, so as to encroach upon or impair the supremacy of the United States.... "" Surmising that the Compact Clause could not have been intended to have such a broad reach, Justice Field concluded that the Clause prohibits states from entering into compacts without congressional consent only when the underlying compact is ""directed to the formation of any combination tending to the increase of political power in the States, which may encroach upon or interfere with the just supremacy of the United States."" The Supreme Court has subsequently reaffirmed Justice Field's ""functional view of the Compact Clause,"" and, accordingly, generally where an agreement does not fall within the scope of the Compact Clause as envisioned by the Court in Virginia v. Tennessee , the agreement ""will not be invalidated for lack of congressional consent."" Whether the NPV initiative requires congressional consent under the Compact Clause first requires a determination as to whether NPV even constitutes an interstate compact. At times, its supporters have resisted framing the initiative as an interstate compact, arguably out of concern for running afoul of the Compact Clause's provisions. For example, Professor Akhil Amar has argued that because the initiative does not create a ""new interstate governmental apparatus,"" the NPV should not be considered an interstate compact, as NPV compact signatory states are merely exercising power collectively that each state could exercise on its own. It is unclear, however, whether the creation of a new interstate governmental entity formed out of an agreement between two or more states is necessary, as opposed to sufficient, in order to deem an agreement as being an interstate compact subject to the Compact Clause. While the Supreme Court, in Northeast Bancorp , suggested that a ""joint organization or body"" formed out of an interstate agreement is a ""classic indic[ium] of a compact,"" the Court has never adopted a definition of an interstate compact that solely rests on the existence of an interstate governmental body. Instead, the Court appears to have adopted a broader definition of what an interstate compact can entail. For example, in Virginia v. Tennessee , the Court noted that the words ""compacts"" and ""agreements"" are synonymous and ""cover all stipulations affecting the conduct or claims of the parties."" In other words, when two or more states enter into a stipulated agreement whereby one state agrees to perform an act in consideration for a reciprocal act by the other state(s), that agreement can be considered an interstate compact. This broad definition of a compact appears to encompass the NPV compact, as the initiative requires signatory states to agree mutually to appoint their electors to the winner of the national popular vote. Moreover, NPV binds each assenting state, as no member state can withdraw from it within six months or less of the end of a President's term. Because NPV prohibits states from freely ""modify[ing] or repeal[ing] [the agreement] unilaterally"" and requires ""reciprocation"" of mutual obligations, it appears that the initiative can be described as an interstate compact. Assuming the NPV initiative is an interstate compact, the question remains whether it is one that implicates the Compact Clause. The answer to that question primarily depends on whether NPV is ""directed to the formation of any combination tending to the increase of political power in the States, which may encroach upon or interfere with the just supremacy of the United States ."" In other words, the ""test"" for whether a particular interstate compact requires congressional consent is centrally concerned with vertical balances of power between the federal government and the states; namely, ""whether the Compact enhances state power quoad the National Government."" While the NPV arguably increases the political power of the states that have consented to it by ensuring that those states' desired outcome for the presidential election—the awarding of the majority of electoral votes to the presidential candidate supported by the majority of the voting populace—it is unclear how that increase in political power would be at the expense of the power of the federal government. After all, the Constitution provides the federal government with no role in determining the members of the electoral college. One scholar has suggested that the NPV initiative would lead to a vertical alteration of power by eliminating the possibility that the House of Representatives would resolve a presidential election in the absence of an electoral majority for a single candidate because it is premised on a majority of electoral votes going to a single candidate. The House of Representatives, however, has decided only two presidential elections in American history, and whether such an arguably hypothetical and de minimis diminishment of federal power through the NPV would be sufficient to require congressional consent under the Compact Clause is simply unresolved by the relevant case law. While the Supreme Court's case law interpreting the Compact Clause is centrally concerned with vertical federalism concerns (i.e., the balance of power between the state and federal governments), the Court has recognized a potential secondary rationale suggested for the Compact Clause: to preserve the horizontal balance of powers among the various states. And horizontal federalism concerns could very well be implicated by the Compact Clause, as the provision appears to have been included in the Constitution out of concern both for the supremacy of the federal government and unity among the various states. Whether the NPV compact threatens the powers of nonconsenting states has been the subject of much debate among academics. Those in support of the initiative have contended that the nonconsenting states do not lose any power as a result of the NPV. According to this line of argumentation, even under the NPV, all states would retain their right to select the electors of their choosing, as nonmember state electors would still be counted in the electoral vote. Others, however, have pointed to the underlying premise of the NPV—to enhance the political power of more populous states in presidential elections—as evidence that the initiative diminishes the power of nonconsenting states. In other words, while non-compacting states would still retain the power to appoint electors, the influence that comes with that power would arguably be diminished because a state's role in the national election would be defined by its percentage of the popular vote and not by its percentage of electors, warranting congressional interest in approving a compact that effectuated such a change in national elections. Ultimately, however, whether the NPV actually threatens the power of nonconsenting states is a debate that remains active within academia but would likely be the source of considerable litigation if the initiative ever became effective. If congressional consent is needed for the NPV, that consent can take various forms. Usually congressional consent to an interstate compact takes the form of a joint resolution or act of Congress specifying its approval of the text of the compact and adding any conditions or provisions it deems necessary, often embodying the compact document. As with most congressional actions, consent to an interstate compact must occur with the approval of both houses and must be signed by the President before it becomes law. Rarely has the President vetoed or threatened to veto consent legislation by Congress. While congressional consent to an interstate compact is most often explicit, consent by Congress may also be implied by subsequent acts of Congress as ""[a]n inference clear and satisfactory that Congress ... intended to consent"" to a compact may be sufficient. Congress may also delegate its power to approve a compact to a federal official so long as an ""intelligible principle"" against which approval can be measured is apparent. Ultimately, if congressional consent is truly needed for NPV to be effective, the initiative might have difficulty ever being enacted because the approval of both houses of Congress and the President would likely necessitate additional hurdles beyond the already challenging task of amassing support at the state level for the NPV. Beyond the legal issues raised with respect to the Compact Clause, the NPV initiative also potentially raises other broader constitutional concerns, including whether the states can functionally obviate the role of the electoral college through the NPV. Article II of the Constitution establishes that the election of the President should occur indirectly through the election by the electoral college. The choice of an indirect election for the President was a deliberate one by the Framers of the Constitution, because, while noting the importance that the ""sense of the people"" should influence the choice for President, they found it ""equally desirable"" for the ""immediate election"" of the President to be made by a body representative of distinct state interests and removed from the threat of unchecked majoritarianism. The result was that the Constitution established a presidential election process that was ""manifestly nonmajoritarian,"" with the electoral college, a body established to represent the distinct views of each state, as the centerpiece of the election process. The central constitutional issue presented by the NPV, therefore, is whether the states, through an interstate compact, can functionally transform the presidential election system enshrined in the Constitution into a more majoritarian process. Supporters of the NPV argue that the Constitution provides the legal means for states to transform the presidential election system into one where the President is elected based solely on the result of the national popular vote. Specifically, clause 2 of Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution provides the states with the power to ""appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct,"" the electors who represent the state in the electoral college. Facially, the Constitution's primary limitation on the power of a state to select its electors is the final number of electors awarded to each state. While perhaps an argument can be made that the structure, logic, and history of the Constitution place limits on the manner or method in which a state chooses its electors, the text of the Constitution simply does not impose any such limits. Supreme Court case law also supports reading Article II of the Constitution to broadly provide states with wide discretion as to the manner in which its electors are selected. Specifically, in 1892 in McPherson v. Blacker, a unanimous Supreme Court upheld a Michigan law providing for the election by individual congressional district of presidential electors against a challenge that the law violated Article II of the Constitution. In so holding, the Court placed great emphasis on a number of state laws that existed shortly after the ratification that provided a variety of ""modes of choosing the electors,"" including selection by the legislature itself, by a ""vote of the people for a general ticket,"" ""by vote of the people in districts,"" or by some permutation of those methods. Viewing this evidence together with the text of Article II and the historical evidence from the Constitutional Convention led the Court to broadly conclude state legislatures have ""conceded plenary power ... in the matter of the appointment of electors,"" allowing the Michigan law to stand. Applying McPherson to the case of the NPV, the argument can and has been made that if the states have plenary power with respect to the manner of how electors are appointed, the power necessarily allows states to select electors in line with the results of the national popular vote. More recently, supporters of the NPV have relied on the Supreme Court's 2015 ruling in Arizona Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission (AIRC) —which held that the State of Arizona had wide discretion under the Elections Clause of the Constitution to select the method by which the state provided for redistricting —to argue that the states retain broad discretion in selecting electors under Article II, which uses similar language to the provision interpreted in AIRC. Others have argued that the structure of the Constitution and historical evidence suggest that the states do not have such vast discretion in appointing electors as to functionally transform the election for President into a national popular referendum. As noted elsewhere in this report, the electoral college was created by the Framers to ensure that states with the least population retained power in the selection of the President, providing a check against domination by the most populous states. The electoral college, being a product of the choices of individual state legislatures, was envisioned by the Framers as a body that would represent the specific interests of a given state, as opposed to the undifferentiated nation at large. Accordingly, it may be argued that allowing the most populous states to collude to ensure that the national popular vote, as opposed to the wishes of an individual state, dictates the results of a state's slate of electors, could arguably be irreconcilable with the Framers' intentions with respect to the electoral college. As such, for those who find the NPV compact constitutionally suspect under Article II, McPherson 's broad pronouncements about the nature of a state's power to appoint electors should be viewed in the context of that particular case, where the state of Michigan was attempting to appoint its electors based on the votes of an individual district in the state, as opposed to the state as a whole. In contrast to the law at issue in McPherson , with NPV, there appears to be no evidence contemporaneous with the ratification of the Constitution of a state selecting its electors in accordance with the results of the national popular vote. Unlike the State of Michigan in McPherson , an NPV state's electors might not be a product of the views of the state at the time of the election, but instead would reflect national popular sentiment about who should be the President. Moreover, the Supreme Court, in interpreting arguably analogous language from Article I of the Constitution allowing states to regulate the manner of the selection of the Members of the House of Representatives and Senate, concluded that the states cannot exercise their delegated authority in a way that would ""effect a fundamental change in the constitutional structure."" The question that remains is whether the Court in a future case challenging the NPV compact would interpret the states' authority under Article II to appoint electors to be broad enough to allow the President to be selected as a result of the national popular vote, a question that, given the lack of any precise precedent respecting the constitutionality of the NPV compact under Article II, will likely remain unresolved until such time. Other critics claim the NPV compact might violate Sections 2 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA). Writing in Columbia Law Review , David Gringer invokes the voting power theory. He argues that the plan conflicts with Section 2 of the VRA because moving from ""a state-based [vote] to a national popular vote dilutes the voting strength of a given state's minority population by reducing its ability [voting power] to influence the outcome of presidential elections."" Gringer also asserts that the NPV compact may violate Section 5 of the act. In 2013, however, the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated Section 4(b) of the VRA, which contained a formula prescribing which states and jurisdictions with a history of discrimination were required to obtain prior approval or ""preclearance"" under Section 5 before changing any voting standard, practice, or procedure. Although the Court invalidated only the coverage formula in Section 4, by extension, Section 5 has been rendered currently inoperable. Prior to the Supreme Court ruling, Gringer argued that the NPV compact would qualify as a covered practice under Section 5, and that the legislatures of all the ""covered"" states would have been required to obtain preclearance before implementing the compact. Responding to this point, National Popular Vote Inc. noted the following: The National Popular Vote bill manifestly would make every person's vote for President equal throughout the United States in an election to fill a single office (the Presidency). It is entirely consistent with the goal of the Voting Rights Act. There have been court cases under the Voting Rights Act concerning contemplated changes in voting methods for various representative legislative bodies.... However, these cases do not bear on elections to fill a single office (i.e., the Presidency). In 2012, the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division specifically declined to challenge California's accession to the NPV compact on VRA grounds. The states' authority to appoint electors by any method their legislatures choose is not absolute. Federal court decisions have struck down state laws concerning appointment of electors that were found to be in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection: Although Clause 2 (of Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution) seemingly vests complete discretion in the states, certain older cases had recognized a federal interest in protecting the integrity of the process. Thus, the Court upheld the power of Congress to protect the right of all citizens who are entitled to vote to lend aid and support in any legal manner to the election of any legally qualified person as a presidential elector.... [I]n Oregon v. Mitchell (42 U.S. 112 (1970)), the Court upheld the power of Congress to reduce the voting age in presidential elections and to set a thirty-day durational residency period as a qualification for voting in presidential elections. Although the Justices were divided on the reasons, the rationale emerging from this case, considered with Williams v. Rhodes , (393 U.S. 20 1968)) is that the Fourteenth Amendment limits state discretion in prescribing the manner of selecting electors and that Congress in enforcing the Fourteenth Amendment may override state practices that violate that Amendment and may substitute standards of its own. Critics of the electoral college system have sought direct election of the President and Vice President without success for more than two centuries. The NPV initiative represents a novel effort to achieve this goal by use of an interstate compact that would circumvent the stringent requirements necessary for the proposal and ratification of constitutional amendments. Since its inception in 2006, NPV has achieved a degree of success: 14 states and the District of Columbia, controlling a total of 189 electoral votes, have joined the compact since 2008. Progress has arguably been sporadic, however, notwithstanding active campaigning by National Popular Vote Inc. Over the course of more than a decade, NPV has heretofore failed to develop a sustained momentum toward its stated goal of states controlling 270 electoral votes. The action of three states in joining NPV to date in 2019 marks the most activity in a single year since 2008; it remains to be seen whether this trend will continue. To date, certain Democratic-leaning states have joined the compact. The arguable lack of support in Republican-controlled state legislatures raises questions about further accessions to the compact in the immediate future, particularly given the fact that the GOP controlled both legislative chambers in 30 states following the 2018 elections. To date, while the NPV initiative has generated interest among supporters of direct popular election of the President, it does not appear to have gained widespread awareness among the public at large. The findings of the March 27, 2019, Politico/Morning Consult survey cited earlier in this report arguably suggest that greater public knowledge of NPV might spur popular support for the compact. This might then contribute to further momentum if additional states were to join, particularly populous ones like Florida (29 electoral votes), Georgia (16 electoral votes), and Ohio (18 electoral votes) where the compact was under active consideration in 2019. Under these circumstances, proponents might be energized and encouraged by a sense of progress for the initiative. At the same time, NPV opponents could be expected to coalesce around the issues identified earlier in this report, and renew and increase their efforts in defense of the electoral college system. The activities of both might ultimately bring the NPV initiative to the more immediate attention of Congress.\n\n","['The National Popular Vote (NPV) initiative proposes an agreement among the states, an interstate compact that would effectively achieve direct popular election of the President and Vice President without a constitutional amendment. It relies on the Constitution\'s grant of authority to the states in Article II, Section 1 to appoint presidential electors ""in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct.... "" Any state that joins the NPV compact pledges that if the compact comes into effect, its legislature will award all the state\'s electoral votes to the presidential ticket that wins the most popular votes nationwide, regardless of who wins in that particular state. The compact would, however, come into effect only if its success has been assured; that is, only if states controlling a majority of electoral votes (270 or more) join the compact. By early May 2019, 14 states and the District of Columbia had joined the compact. After early momentum—eight states and the District of Columbia joined the NPV Compact between 2007 and 2011—the pace of state accessions slowed through 2018. Since then, four additional states joined, bringing the total number of electoral votes controlled by NPV member states to 189. During the same period, legislation to join the compact had been introduced during the current session in at least one chamber of the legislature in 14 additional states that control an additional 150 electors. The NPV initiative emerged following the presidential election of 2000, in which one ticket gained an electoral vote majority, winning the presidency, but received fewer popular votes than its opponents. NPV grew out of subsequent discussions among scholars and activists about how to avoid similar outcomes in the future and to achieve direct popular election. Proponents of NPV assert that it would guarantee the presidential candidates who win the most popular votes nationwide will always win the presidency; that it would end the inequities of the general ticket/winner-take-all system of awarding electoral votes; and that candidates would extend their focus beyond winning the ""battleground states,"" campaigning more widely and devoting greater attention to issues of concern to other parts of the country. They further assert that NPV would accomplish this while avoiding the exacting standards set for the proposal and ratification of constitutional amendments. Opponents argue that NPV would undermine the authority of states under the Constitution and the Founders\' intention that presidential elections should be both national and federal contests; that it is an admitted ""end run"" around the Constitution that would circumvent the amendment process; and that it might actually lead to more disputed presidential elections characterized by politically contentious state recounts. The NPV has also been debated on legal grounds. Some observers maintain that it must be approved by Congress, because it is an interstate compact that would affect key provisions of constitutional presidential election procedures. NPV Inc., the organization managing the initiative\'s advocacy campaign, responds that congressional approval is not necessary because NPV concerns the appointment of electors, a subject that falls within state constitutional authority, and that the Supreme Court has previously rejected arguments that similar compacts would impair the rights of nonmember states. Other critics claim that NPV might violate the Voting Rights Act by diluting minority voter influence and avoiding the recently invalidated preclearance requirement for election procedure changes in covered jurisdictions. In response, NPV Inc. has asserted that the compact is ""entirely consistent with the goal of the Voting Rights Act."" This report monitors the NPV\'s progress in the states and will identify and analyze further developments as warranted.']","10755","gov_report","en","None","b685812d90230eb593103d16207df42759bc6e12af94148f","Summary:","gov_report","532","\nThe National Popular Vote (NPV) initiative is a proposal to establish direct popular popular direct popular direct popular direct popular election of the President and Vice President in the United States.

"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nAccording to the President’s budget, the federal government plans to invest more than $96 billion for IT in fiscal year 2018—the largest amount ever budgeted. Despite such large IT expenditures, we have previously reported that investments in federal IT too often result in failed projects that incur cost overruns and schedule slippages, while contributing little to the desired mission-related outcomes. For example: The tri-agency National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System was disbanded in February 2010 by the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy after the program spent 16 years and almost $5 billion. The Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Secure Border Initiative Network program was ended in January 2011, after the department obligated more than $1 billion for the program. The Department of Veterans Affairs’ Financial and Logistics Integrated Technology Enterprise program was intended to be delivered by 2014 at a total estimated cost of $609 million, but was terminated in October 2011. The Department of Defense’s Expeditionary Combat Support System was canceled in December 2012 after spending more than a billion dollars and failing to deploy within 5 years of initially obligating funds. The United States Coast Guard (Coast Guard) decided to terminate its Integrated Health Information System project in 2015. As reported by the agency in August 2017, the Coast Guard spent approximately $60 million over 7 years on this project, which resulted in no equipment or software that could be used for future efforts. Our past work has found that these and other failed IT projects often suffered from a lack of disciplined and effective management, such as project planning, requirements definition, and program oversight and governance. In many instances, agencies had not consistently applied best practices that are critical to successfully acquiring IT. Such projects have also failed due to a lack of oversight and governance. Executive-level governance and oversight across the government has often been ineffective, specifically from CIOs. For example, we have reported that some CIOs’ roles were limited because they did not have the authority to review and approve the entire agency IT portfolio. In addition to failures when acquiring IT, security deficiencies can threaten systems once they become operational. As we previously reported, in order to counter security threats, 23 civilian Chief Financial Officers Act agencies spent a combined total of approximately $4 billion on IT security-related activities in fiscal year 2016. Even so, our cybersecurity work at federal agencies continues to highlight information security deficiencies. The following examples describe the types of risks we have found at federal agencies. In November 2017, we reported that the Department of Education’s Office of Federal Student Aid did not consistently analyze privacy risks for its electronic information systems, and policies and procedures for protecting information systems were not always up to date. In August 2017, we reported that, since the 2015 data breaches, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) had taken actions to prevent, mitigate, and respond to data breaches involving sensitive personal and background investigation information. However, we noted that the agency had not fully implemented recommendations made to OPM by DHS’s United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team to help the agency improve its overall security posture and improve its ability to protect its systems and information from security breaches. In July 2017, we reported that IT security at the Internal Revenue Service had weaknesses that limited its effectiveness in protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of financial and sensitive taxpayer data. An underlying reason for these weaknesses was that the Internal Revenue Service had not effectively implemented elements of its information security program. In May 2016, we reported that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, OPM, and the Department of Veteran Affairs did not always control access to selected high-impact systems, patch known software vulnerabilities, and plan for contingencies. An underlying reason for these weaknesses was that the agencies had not fully implemented key elements of their information security programs. In August 2016, we reported that the IT security of the Food and Drug Administration had significant weaknesses that jeopardized the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information systems and industry and public health data. Congress and the President have enacted various key pieces of reform legislation to address IT management issues. These include the federal IT acquisition reform legislation commonly referred to as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA). This legislation was intended to improve covered agencies’ acquisitions of IT and enable Congress to monitor agencies’ progress and hold them accountable for reducing duplication and achieving cost savings. The law includes specific requirements related to seven areas: Agency CIO authority enhancements. CIOs at covered agencies have the authority to, among other things, (1) approve the IT budget requests of their respective agencies and (2) review and approve IT contracts. Federal data center consolidation initiative (FDCCI). Agencies covered by FITARA are required, among other things, to provide a strategy for consolidating and optimizing their data centers and issue quarterly updates on the progress made. Enhanced transparency and improved risk management. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and covered agencies are to make detailed information on federal IT investments publicly available, and agency CIOs are to categorize their investments by level of risk. Portfolio review. Covered agencies are to annually review IT investment portfolios in order to, among other things, increase efficiency and effectiveness and identify potential waste and duplication. Expansion of training and use of IT acquisition cadres. Covered agencies are to update their acquisition human capital plans to support timely and effective IT acquisitions. In doing so, the law calls for agencies to consider, among other things, establishing IT acquisition cadres (i.e., multi-functional groups of professionals to acquire and manage complex programs), or developing agreements with other agencies that have such cadres. Government-wide software purchasing program. The General Services Administration is to develop a strategic sourcing initiative to enhance government-wide acquisition and management of software. In doing so, the law requires that, to the maximum extent practicable, the General Services Administration should allow for the purchase of a software license agreement that is available for use by all executive branch agencies as a single user. Maximizing the benefit of the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative. Federal agencies are required to compare their purchases of services and supplies to what is offered under the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative. In June 2015, OMB released guidance describing how agencies are to implement FITARA. This guidance is intended to, among other things: assist agencies in aligning their IT resources with statutory establish government-wide IT management controls to meet the law’s requirements, while providing agencies with flexibility to adapt to unique agency processes and requirements; strengthen the relationship between agency CIOs and bureau CIOs; strengthen CIO accountability for IT costs, schedules, performance, and security. The guidance identifies a number of actions that agencies are to take to establish a basic set of roles and responsibilities (referred to as the common baseline) for CIOs and other senior agency officials; and thus, to implement the authorities described in the law. For example, agencies are to conduct a self-assessment and submit a plan describing the changes they intend to make to ensure that common baseline responsibilities are implemented. In addition, in August 2016, OMB released guidance intended to, among other things, define a framework for achieving the data center consolidation and optimization requirements of FITARA. The guidance directs agencies to develop a data center consolidation and optimization strategic plan that defines the agency’s data center strategy for fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018. This strategy is to include, among other things, a statement from the agency CIO indicating whether the agency has complied with all data center reporting requirements in FITARA. Further, the guidance indicates that OMB is to maintain a public dashboard to display consolidation-related costs savings and optimization performance information for the agencies. Congress has recognized the importance of agencies’ continued implementation of FITARA provisions, and has taken legislative action to extend selected provisions beyond their original dates of expiration. Specifically, Congress and the President enacted laws to: remove the expiration date for enhanced transparency and improved risk management provisions, which were set to expire in 2019; remove the expiration date for portfolio review, which was set to expire in 2019; and extend the expiration date for FDCCI from 2018 to 2020. In addition, Congress and the President enacted a law to authorize the availability of funding mechanisms to help further agencies’ efforts to modernize IT. The law, known as the Modernizing Government Technology (MGT) Act, authorizes agencies to establish working capital funds for use in transitioning from legacy IT systems, as well as for addressing evolving threats to information security. The law also creates the Technology Modernization Fund, within the Department of the Treasury, from which agencies can “borrow” money to retire and replace legacy systems, as well as acquire or develop systems. Further, in February 2018, OMB issued guidance for agencies to implement the MGT Act. The guidance was intended to provide agencies additional information regarding the Technology Modernization Fund, and the administration and funding of the related IT working capital funds. Specifically, the guidance allowed agencies to begin submitting initial project proposals for modernization on February 27, 2018. In addition, in accordance with the MGT Act, the guidance provides details regarding a Technology Modernization Board, which is to consist of (1) the Federal CIO; (2) a senior official from the General Services Administration; (3) a member of DHS’s National Protection and Program Directorate; and (4) four federal employees with technical expertise in IT development, financial management, cybersecurity and privacy, and acquisition, appointed by the Director of OMB. Congress and the President enacted the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA) to improve federal cybersecurity and clarify government-wide responsibilities. The act addresses the increasing sophistication of cybersecurity attacks, promotes the use of automated security tools with the ability to continuously monitor and diagnose the security posture of federal agencies, and provides for improved oversight of federal agencies’ information security programs. Specifically, the act clarifies and assigns additional responsibilities to entities such as OMB, DHS, and the federal agencies. Table 1 describes a selection of OMB, DHS, and agency responsibilities. Beyond the implementation of FITARA, FISMA, and related actions, the current administration has also initiated other efforts intended to improve federal IT. Specifically, in March 2017, the administration established the Office of American Innovation, which has a mission to, among other things, make recommendations to the President on policies and plans aimed at improving federal government operations and services. In doing so, the office is to consult with both OMB and the Office of Science and Technology Policy on policies and plans intended to improve government operations and services, improve the quality of life for Americans, and spur job creation. In May 2017, the Administration also established the American Technology Council, which has a goal of helping to transform and modernize federal agency IT and how the federal government uses and delivers digital services. The President is the chairman of this council, and the Federal CIO and the United States Digital Service Administrator are among the members. In addition, on May 11, 2017, the President signed Executive Order 13800, Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure. This executive order outlined actions to enhance cybersecurity across federal agencies and critical infrastructure to improve the nation’s cyber posture and capabilities against cyber security threats. Among other things, the order tasked the Director of the American Technology Council to coordinate a report to the President from the Secretary of DHS, the Director of OMB, and the Administrator of the General Services Administration, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, regarding the modernization of federal IT. As a result, the Report to the President on Federal IT Modernization was issued on December 13, 2017, and outlined the current and envisioned state of federal IT. The report focused on modernization efforts to improve the security posture of federal IT and recognized that agencies have attempted to modernize systems but have been stymied by a variety of factors, including resource prioritization, ability to procure services quickly, and technical issues. The report provided multiple recommendations intended to address these issues through the modernization and consolidation of networks and the use of shared services to enable future network architectures. Further, in March 2018, the Administration issued the President’s Management Agenda, which lays out a long-term vision for modernizing the federal government. The agenda identifies three related drivers of transformation—IT modernization; data, accountability, and transparency; and the workforce of the future—that are intended to push change across the federal government. The Administration also established 14 related Cross-Agency Priority goals, many of which have elements that involve IT. In particular, the Cross-Agency Priority goal on IT modernization states that modern IT must function as the backbone of how government serves the public in the digital age and provides three priorities that are to guide the Administration’s efforts to modernize federal IT: (1) enhancing mission effectiveness by improving the quality and efficiency of critical services, including the increased utilization of cloud-based solutions; (2) reducing cybersecurity risks to the federal mission by leveraging current commercial capabilities and implementing cutting edge cybersecurity capabilities; and (3) building a modern IT workforce by recruiting, reskilling, and retaining professionals able to help drive modernization with up-to-date technology. Most recently, on May 15, 2018, the President signed Executive Order 13833, Enhancing the Effectiveness of Agency Chief Information Officers. Among other things, this executive order is intended to better position agencies to modernize their IT systems, execute IT programs more efficiently, and reduce cybersecurity risks. The order pertains to 22 of the 24 Chief Financial Officer Act agencies: the Department of Defense and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission are exempt. For the covered agencies, the executive order strengthens the role of agency CIOs by, among other things, requiring to report directly to their agency head; to serve as their agency head’s primary IT strategic advisor; and to have a significant role in all management, governance, and oversight processes related to IT. In addition, one of the cybersecurity requirements directs agencies to ensure that the CIO works closely with an integrated team of senior executives, including those with expertise in IT, security, and privacy, to implement appropriate risk management measures. In the February 2017 update to our high-risk series, we reported that agencies still needed to complete significant work related to the management of IT acquisitions and operations We stressed that OMB and federal agencies should continue to expeditiously implement FITARA and OMB’s related guidance, which include enhancing CIO authority, consolidating data centers, and acquiring and managing software licenses. Our update to this high-risk area also stressed that OMB and agencies needed to continue to implement our prior recommendations in order to improve their ability to effectively and efficiently invest in IT. Specifically, from fiscal years 2010 through 2015, we made 803 recommendations to OMB and federal agencies to address shortcomings in IT acquisitions and operations. In addition, in fiscal year 2016, we made 202 new recommendations, thus, further reinforcing the need for OMB and agencies to address the shortcomings in IT acquisitions and operations. As stated in the update, OMB and agencies should demonstrate government-wide progress in the management of IT investments by, among other things, implementing at least 80 percent of our recommendations related to managing IT acquisitions and operations within 4 years. As of May 2018, OMB and agencies had fully implemented 489 (or about 61 percent) of the 803 recommendations. Figure 1 summarizes the progress that OMB and agencies have made in addressing our recommendations as compared to the 80 percent target. Overall, federal agencies would be better positioned to realize billions in cost savings and additional management improvements if they address these recommendations, including those aimed at implementing CIO responsibilities, review of IT acquisitions; improving data center consolidation; and managing software licenses. In all, the various laws, such as FITARA, and related guidance assign 35 IT management responsibilities to CIOs in six key areas. These areas are: leadership and accountability, budgeting, information security, investment management, workforce, and strategic planning. In a draft report on CIO responsibilities that we have provided to the agencies for comment and plan to issue in June 2018, our preliminary results suggest that none of the 24 agencies we reviewed had policies that fully addressed the role of their CIO, as called for by federal laws and guidance. In this regard, a majority of the agencies fully or substantially addressed the role of their CIOs for the area of leadership and accountability. In addition, a majority of the agencies substantially or partially addressed the role of their CIOs for two areas: information security and IT budgeting. However, most agencies partially or minimally addressed the role of their CIOs for two areas: investment management and strategic planning. These preliminary results are shown in figure 2. Despite these shortfalls, most agency officials stated that their CIOs are implementing the responsibilities even if the agencies do not have policies requiring implementation. Nevertheless, the CIOs of the 24 selected agencies acknowledged in responses to a survey that we administered for our draft report that they were not always very effective in implementing the six IT management areas. Specifically, our preliminary results show that at least 10 of the CIOs indicated that they were less than very effective for each of the six areas of responsibility. We believe that until agencies fully address the role of CIOs in their policies, agencies will be limited in addressing longstanding IT management challenges. Figure 3 depicts that extent to which the CIOs reported their effectiveness in implementing the six areas of responsibility. Beyond the actions of the agencies, however, our preliminary results indicate that shortcomings in agencies’ policies also are partially attributable to two weaknesses in OMB’s FITARA implementation guidance. First, the guidance does not comprehensively address all CIO responsibilities, such as those related to assessing the extent to which personnel meet IT management knowledge and skill requirements, and ensuring that personnel are held accountable for complying with the information security program. Correspondingly, the majority of the agencies’ policies did not fully address nearly all of the responsibilities that were not included in OMB’s guidance. Second, OMB’s guidance does not ensure that CIOs have a significant role in (1) IT planning, programming, and budgeting decisions and (2) execution decisions and the management, governance, and oversight processes related to IT, as required by federal law and guidance. In the absence of comprehensive guidance, CIOs will not be positioned to effectively acquire, maintain, and secure their IT systems. Based on our preliminary results, 24 agency CIOs also identified a number of factors that enabled and challenged their ability to effectively manage IT. As shown in figure 4, five factors were identified by at least half of the 24 CIOs as major enablers and three factors were identified by at least half of the CIOs as major challenges. Specifically, most agency CIOs cited five factors as being enablers to effectively carry out their responsibilities: (1) NIST guidance, (2) the CIO’s position in the agency hierarchy, (3) OMB guidance, (4) coordination with the Chief Acquisition Officer (CAO), and (5) legal authority. Further, three factors were cited by CIOs as major factors that have challenged their ability to effectively carry out responsibilities: (1) processes for hiring, recruiting, and retaining IT personnel; (2) financial resources; and (3) the availability of personnel/staff resources. As our draft report states, although OMB has issued guidance aimed at addressing the three factors that were identified by at least half of the CIOs as major challenges, the guidance does not fully address those challenges. Further, regarding the financial resources challenge, OMB recently required agencies to provide data on CIO authority over IT spending; however, its guidance does not provide a complete definition of the authority. We believe that in the absence of such guidance, agencies have created varying definitions of CIO authority. Further, until OMB updates its guidance to include a complete definition of the authority that CIOs are to have over IT spending, it will be difficult for OMB to identify any deficiencies in this area and to help agencies make any needed improvements. In order to address challenges in implementing CIO responsibilities, we intend to include in our draft report recommendations to OMB and each of the selected 24 federal agencies to improve the effectiveness of CIOs’ implementation of their responsibilities for each of the six IT management areas. FITARA includes a provision to enhance covered agency CIOs’ authority through, among other things, requiring agency heads to ensure that CIOs review and approve IT contracts. OMB’s FITARA implementation guidance expanded upon this aspect of the legislation in a number of ways. Specifically, according to the guidance: CIOs may review and approve IT acquisition strategies and plans, rather than individual IT contracts; CIOs can designate other agency officials to act as their representatives, but the CIOs must retain accountability; CAOs are responsible for ensuring that all IT contract actions are consistent with CIO-approved acquisition strategies and plans; and CAOs are to indicate to the CIOs when planned acquisition strategies and acquisition plans include IT. In January 2018, we reported that most of the CIOs at 22 selected agencies were not adequately involved in reviewing billions of dollars of IT acquisitions. For instance, most of the 22 agencies did not identify all of their IT contracts. In this regard, the agencies identified 78,249 IT- related contracts, to which they obligated $14.7 billion in fiscal year 2016. However, we identified 31,493 additional contracts with $4.5 billion obligated, raising the total amount obligated by these agencies to IT contracts in fiscal year 2016 to at least $19.2 billion. Figure 5 reflects the obligations that the 22 selected agencies reported to us relative to the obligations we identified. The percentage of additional IT contract obligations we identified varied among the selected agencies. For example, the Department of State did not identify 1 percent of its IT contract obligations. Conversely, 8 agencies did not identify over 40 percent of their IT contract obligations. Many of the selected agencies that did not identify these IT contract obligations did not follow OMB guidance. Specifically, 14 of the 22 agencies did not involve the acquisition office in their process to identify IT acquisitions for CIO review, as required by OMB. In addition, 7 agencies did not establish guidance to aid officials in recognizing IT. We concluded that until these agencies involve the acquisitions office in their IT acquisition identification processes and establish supporting guidance, they cannot ensure that they will identify all IT acquisitions. Without proper identification of IT acquisitions, these agencies and CIOs cannot effectively provide oversight of these acquisitions. In addition to not identifying all IT contracts, 14 of the 22 selected agencies did not fully satisfy OMB’s requirement that the CIO review and approve IT acquisition plans or strategies. Further, only 11 of 96 randomly selected IT contracts at 10 agencies that we evaluated were CIO-reviewed and approved as required by OMB’s guidance. The 85 IT contracts not reviewed had a total possible value of approximately $23.8 billion. We believe that until agencies ensure that CIOs are able to review and approve all IT acquisitions, CIOs will continue to have limited visibility and input into their agencies’ planned IT expenditures and will not be able to use the increased authority that FITARA’s contract approval provision is intended to provide. Further, agencies will likely miss an opportunity to strengthen CIOs’ authority and the oversight of IT acquisitions. As a result, agencies may award IT contracts that are duplicative, wasteful, or poorly conceived. As a result of these findings, we made 39 recommendations in our January 2018 report. The recommendations included that agencies ensure that their acquisition offices are involved in identifying IT acquisitions and issuing related guidance, and that IT acquisitions are reviewed in accordance with OMB guidance. OMB and the majority of the agencies generally agreed with or did not comment on the recommendations. In our February 2017 high-risk update, we stated that OMB and agencies needed to demonstrate additional progress on achieving data center consolidation savings in order to improve the management of IT acquisitions and operations. Further, data center consolidation efforts are key to implementing FITARA. Specifically, OMB established the FDCCI in February 2010 to improve the efficiency, performance, and environmental footprint of federal data center activities. The enactment of FITARA in 2014 codified and expanded the initiative. In a series of reports that we issued from July 2011 through August 2017, we noted that, while data center consolidation could potentially save the federal government billions of dollars, weaknesses existed in several areas, including agencies’ data center consolidation plans, data center optimization, and OMB’s tracking and reporting on related cost savings. In these reports, we made a total of 160 recommendations to OMB and 24 agencies to improve the execution and oversight of the initiative. Most agencies and OMB agreed with our recommendations or had no comments. As of May 2018, 80 of these 160 recommendations remained unimplemented. Further, we recently reported in May 2018 that the 24 agencies participating in OMB’s Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI) had communicated mixed progress toward achieving OMB’s goals for closing data centers by September 2018. Over half of the agencies reported that they had either already met, or planned to meet, all of their OMB- assigned goals by the deadline. This would result in the closure of 7,221 of the 12,062 centers that agencies reported in August 2017. However, 4 agencies reported that they do not have plans to meet all of their assigned goals and 2 agencies are working with OMB to establish revised targets. With regard to agencies’ progress in achieving cost savings, 24 agencies reported $3.9 billion in cost savings through 2018. The 24 agencies also reported limited progress against OMB’s five data center optimization targets for server utilization and automated monitoring, energy metering, power usage effectiveness, facility utilization, and virtualization. As of August 2017, 1 agency reported that it had met four targets, 1 agency reported that it had met three targets, 6 agencies reported having met either one or two targets, and 14 agencies reported meeting none of the targets. Further, as of August 2017, most agencies were not planning to meet OMB’s fiscal year 2018 optimization targets. Specifically, 4 agencies reported plans to meet all of their applicable targets by the end of fiscal year 2018; 14 agencies reported plans to meet some of the targets; and 4 reported that they did not plan to meet any targets. Figure 6 summarizes agency-reported plans to meet or exceed the OMB’s data center optimization targets, as of August 2017. In 2016 and 2017, we made 81 recommendations to OMB and the 24 DCOI agencies to help improve the reporting of data center-related cost savings and to achieve optimization targets. As of May 2018, 71 of these 81 recommendations have not been fully addressed. In our 2015 high-risk report’s discussion of IT acquisitions and operations, we identified the management of software licenses as an area of concern, in part because of the potential for cost savings. Federal agencies engage in thousands of software licensing agreements annually. The objective of software license management is to manage, control, and protect an organization’s software assets. Effective management of these licenses can help avoid purchasing too many licenses, which can result in unused software, as well as too few licenses, which can result in noncompliance with license terms and cause the imposition of additional fees. As part of its PortfolioStat initiative, OMB has developed policy that addresses software licenses. This policy requires agencies to conduct an annual, agency-wide IT portfolio review to, among other things, reduce commodity IT spending. Such areas of spending could include software licenses. In May 2014, we reported on federal agencies’ management of software licenses and determined that better management was needed to achieve significant savings government-wide. Of the 24 selected agencies we reviewed, only 2 had comprehensive policies that included the establishment of clear roles and central oversight authority for managing enterprise software license agreements, among other things. Of the remaining 22 agencies, 18 had policies that were not comprehensive, and 4 had not developed any policies. Further, we found that only 2 of the 24 selected agencies had established comprehensive software license inventories, a leading practice that would help them to adequately manage their software licenses. The inadequate implementation of this and other leading practices in software license management was partially due to weaknesses in agencies’ policies. As a result, we concluded that agencies’ oversight of software license spending was limited or lacking, thus potentially leading to missed savings. However, the potential savings could be significant considering that, in fiscal year 2012, 1 major federal agency reported saving approximately $181 million by consolidating its enterprise license agreements, even when its oversight process was ad hoc. Accordingly, we recommended that OMB issue a directive to help guide agencies in managing software licenses. We also made 135 recommendations to the 24 agencies to improve their policies and practices for managing licenses. Among other things, we recommended that the agencies regularly track and maintain a comprehensive inventory of software licenses and analyze the inventory to identify opportunities to reduce costs and better inform investment decision making. Most agencies generally agreed with the recommendations or had no comments. As of May 2018, 78 of the 135 recommendations had not been implemented. Table 2 reflects the extent to which the 24 agencies implemented the recommendations in these two areas. Since information security was added to the high-risk list in 1997, we have consistently identified shortcomings in the federal government’s approach to cybersecurity. We have previously testified that, even though agencies have acted to improve the protections over federal and critical infrastructure information and information systems, the federal government needs to take the following actions to strengthen U.S. cybersecurity: Effectively implement risk-based entity-wide information security programs consistently over time. Among other things, agencies need to (1) implement sustainable processes for securely configuring operating systems, applications, workstations, servers, and network devices; (2) patch vulnerable systems and replace unsupported software; (3) develop comprehensive security test and evaluation procedures and conduct examinations on a regular and recurring basis; and (4) strengthen oversight of contractors providing IT services. Improve its cyber incident detection, response, and mitigation capabilities. DHS needs to expand the capabilities and support wider adoption of its government-wide intrusion detection and prevention system. In addition, the federal government needs to improve cyber incident response practices, update guidance on reporting data breaches, and develop consistent responses to breaches of personally identifiable information. Expand its cyber workforce planning and training efforts. The federal government needs to (1) enhance efforts for recruiting and retaining a qualified cybersecurity workforce and (2) improve cybersecurity workforce planning activities. Expand efforts to strengthen cybersecurity of the nation’s critical infrastructures. The federal government needs to develop metrics to (1) assess the effectiveness of efforts promoting the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity and (2) measure and report on the effectiveness of cyber risk mitigation activities and the cybersecurity posture of critical infrastructure sectors. Better oversee protection of personally identifiable information. The federal government needs to (1) protect the security and privacy of electronic health information, (2) ensure privacy when face recognition systems are used, and (3) protect the privacy of users’ data on state-based health insurance marketplaces. As we have previously noted, in order to take the preceding actions and strengthen the federal government’s cybersecurity posture, agencies should implement the information security programs required by FISMA. In this regard, FISMA provides a framework for ensuring the effectiveness of information security controls for federal information resources. The law requires each agency to develop, document, and implement an agency- wide information security program. Such a program includes risk assessments; the development and implementation of policies and procedures to cost-effectively reduce risks; plans for providing adequate information security for networks, facilities, and systems; security awareness and specialized training; the testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of controls; the planning, implementation, evaluation, and documentation of remedial actions to address information security deficiencies; procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents; and plans and procedures to ensure continuity of operations. Since 2010, we have made 2,733 recommendations to agencies aimed at improving the security of federal systems and information. These recommendations have identified actions for agencies to take to strengthen technical security controls over their computer networks and systems. They also have included recommendations for agencies to fully implement aspects of their information security programs, as mandated by FISMA. Nevertheless, many agencies continue to be challenged in safeguarding their information systems and information, in part because many of these recommendations have not been implemented. As of May 2018, 793 of information security-related recommendations we have made have not been implemented. In order to determine the effectiveness of the agencies’ information security programs and practices, FISMA requires that federal agencies’ inspectors general conduct annual independent evaluations. The agencies are to report the results of these evaluations to OMB, and OMB is to summarize the results in annual reports to Congress. In these evaluations, the inspectors general frame the scope of their analysis, identify key findings, and detail recommendations to address the findings. The evaluations also are to capture maturity model ratings for their respective agencies. Toward this end, in fiscal year 2017, the inspector general community, in partnership with OMB and DHS, finalized a 3-year effort to create a maturity model for FISMA metrics that align to the five function areas in the NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (Cybersecurity Framework): identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. This alignment is intended to help promote consistent and comparable metrics and criteria and provides agencies with a meaningful independent assessment of their information security programs. This maturity model is designed to summarize the status of agencies’ information security programs on a five-level capability maturity scale. The five maturity levels are defined as follows: Level 1 Ad-hoc: Policies, procedures, and strategy are not formalized; activities are performed in an ad-hoc, reactive manner. Level 2 Defined: Policies, procedures, and strategy are formalized and documented but not consistently implemented. Level 3 Consistently Implemented: Policies, procedures, and strategy are consistently implemented, but quantitative and qualitative effectiveness measures are lacking. Level 4 Managed and Measurable: Quantitative and qualitative measures on the effectiveness of policies, procedures, and strategy are collected across the organizations and used to assess them and make necessary changes. Level 5 Optimized: Policies, procedures, and strategy are fully institutionalized, repeatable, self-generating, consistently implemented and regularly updated based on a changing threat and technology landscape and business/mission needs. In March 2018, OMB issued its annual FISMA report to Congress, which showed the combined results of the inspectors general’s fiscal year 2017 evaluations. Based on data from 76 agency inspector general and independent auditor assessments, OMB determined that the government-wide median maturity model ratings across the five NIST Cybersecurity Framework areas did not exceed a level 3 (consistently implemented). Table 3 shows the inspectors general’s median ratings for each of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework areas. In its efforts toward strengthening the federal government’s cybersecurity, OMB also requires agencies to submit related cybersecurity metrics as part of its Cross-Agency Priority goals. In particular, OMB developed the IT modernization goal so that federal agencies will be able to build and maintain more modern, secure, and resilient IT. A key part of this goal is to reduce cybersecurity risks to the federal mission through three strategies: manage asset security, protect networks and data, and limit personnel access. The key targets supporting each of these strategies correspond to areas within the FISMA metrics. Table 4 outlines the strategies and their associated targets. In conclusion, FITARA and FISMA present opportunities for the federal government to address the high-risk areas on improving the management of IT acquisitions and operations, and ensuring the security of federal IT, thereby saving billions of dollars. Most agencies have taken steps to execute key IT management and cybersecurity initiatives, including implementing CIO responsibilities, requiring CIO review of IT acquisitions, realizing data center consolidation cost savings, managing software assets, and complying with FISMA requirements. The agencies have also continued to address the recommendations that we have made over the past several years. However, further efforts by OMB and federal agencies to implement our previous recommendations would better position them to improve the management and security of federal IT. To help ensure that these efforts succeed, we will continue to monitor agencies’ efforts toward implementing these recommendations.

Historically, IT investments have too often failed or contributed little to mission-related outcomes. Further, increasingly sophisticated threats and frequent cyber incidents underscore the need for effective information security. As a result, GAO added two areas to its high-risk list: IT security in 1997 and the management of IT acquisitions and operations in 2015. This statement summarizes agencies' progress in improving IT management and ensuring the security of federal IT. It is primarily based on GAO's prior reports issued between February 1997 and May 2018 (and an ongoing review) on (1) CIO responsibilities, (2) agency CIOs' involvement in approving IT contracts, (3) data center consolidation efforts, (4) the management of software licenses, and (5) compliance with cybersecurity requirements. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and federal agencies have taken steps to improve the management of information technology (IT) acquisitions and operations and ensure the security of federal IT through a series of initiatives. As of May 2018, agencies had fully implemented about 61 percent of the approximately 800 IT management-related recommendations that GAO made from fiscal years 2010 through 2015. Likewise, since 2010, agencies had implemented about 66 percent of the approximately 2,700 security-related recommendations as of May 2018. Even with this progress, significant actions remain to be completed. Chief Information Officer (CIO) responsibilities . Laws such as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) and related guidance assigned 35 key IT management responsibilities to CIOs to help address longstanding challenges. However, in a draft report on CIO responsibilities, GAO's preliminary results suggest that none of the 24 selected agencies have policies that fully address the role of their CIO, as called for by federal laws and guidance. GAO intends to recommend that OMB and each of the selected 24 agencies take actions to improve the effectiveness of CIO's implementation of their responsibilities. IT contract approval . According to FITARA, covered agencies' CIOs are required to review and approve IT contracts. Nevertheless, in January 2018, GAO reported that most of the CIOs at 22 selected agencies were not adequately involved in reviewing billions of dollars of IT acquisitions. Consequently, GAO made 39 recommendations to improve CIO oversight over IT acquisitions. Consolidating data centers . OMB launched an initiative in 2010 to reduce data centers, which was codified and expanded in FITARA. According to agencies, data center consolidation and optimization efforts have resulted in approximately $3.9 billion of cost savings through 2018. Even so, additional work remains. GAO has made 160 recommendations to OMB and agencies to improve the reporting of related cost savings and to achieve optimization targets; however, as of May 2018, 80 of the recommendations have not been fully addressed. Managing software licenses . Effective management of software licenses can help avoid purchasing too many licenses that result in unused software. In May 2014, GAO reported that better management of licenses was needed to achieve savings, and made 135 recommendations to improve such management. Four years later, 78 of the recommendations remained open. Improving the security of federal IT systems . While the government has acted to protect federal information systems, agencies need to improve security programs, cyber capabilities, and the protection of personally identifiable information. Over the last several years, GAO has made about 2,700 recommendations to agencies aimed at improving the security of federal systems and information. These recommendations identified actions for agencies to take to strengthen their information security programs and technical controls over their computer networks and systems. As of May 2018, about 800 of the information security-related recommendations had not been implemented. From fiscal years 2010 through 2015, GAO made about 800 recommendations to OMB and federal agencies to address shortcomings in IT acquisitions and operations. Since 2010, GAO also made about 2,700 recommendations to federal agencies to improve the security of federal systems. These recommendations include those to improve the implementation of CIO responsibilities, the oversight of the data center consolidation initiative, software license management efforts, and the strength of security programs and technical controls. Most agencies agreed with these recommendations, and GAO will continue to monitor their implementation.""]","6259","gov_report","en","None","490f14d293ac1c261a07bd50aeac2e86a9e76c726d7883a2","Summary:","gov_report","532","\nThe federal government plans"
"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nMany Members of Congress became actively engaged in foreign policy debates over U.S. intervention in the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (hereafter, ""Bosnia""). Congress monitored and at times challenged the Bush and Clinton Administrations' response to the conflict through numerous hearings, resolutions, and legislative initiatives. Many observers contend that the United States is a stakeholder in Bosnia's future because of the strong impact of U.S. intervention on the postwar Bosnian state. Nearly 25 years after warring parties in Bosnia reached the Dayton Agreement (see below), Bosnia faces numerous internal and external challenges, and the country retains geopolitical importance to U.S. interests in the Western Balkans. As Congress assesses ongoing and emerging security issues in the region, including resilience against malign external influence, renewed conflict, and radicalization, Bosnia's internal politics and its role in Balkan stability may merit further examination. Bosnia has existed in various forms throughout its history: a medieval kingdom, territory held by two major empires, a federal unit, and, since 1992, an independent state. Bosnia's present international borders are largely consistent with its administrative boundaries under later periods of Ottoman Turkish rule. After World War I, Bosnia became part of the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. It was one of the six constituent republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 1945 until 1992. Bosnia's constitution stems from the U.S.-brokered Dayton Peace Agreement that ended the country's 1992-1995 war. It recognizes three ""constituent peoples"": Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs. All three groups are Slavic. Religious tradition is considered a marker of difference among the three ethnic identities: Bosniaks are predominantly Muslim, Serbs are largely Orthodox Christian, and Croats are mostly Catholic. Although Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian are recognized in Bosnia as distinct official languages, they are mutually intelligible. Bosniaks comprise approximately 50.1% of the population, Bosnian Serbs 30.8%, and Bosnian Croats 15.4%. In this report, Bosnian is used as a non-ethnic term for a person or institution from Bosnia. A Bosnian Serb is an ethnic Serb from Bosnia and a Bosnian Croat is an ethnic Croat from Bosnia. Bosniak refers to Slavic Muslims. Bosnia's religious and cultural diversity is one of its distinctive characteristics. Islam was introduced to part of Bosnia's population during the Ottoman period, although there were also large Catholic, Orthodox Christian, and Jewish communities. Bosnia was the most heterogeneous Yugoslav republic and the only one where no ethnic group formed an absolute majority. During the 1990s, some popular accounts of Bosnia (and the former Yugoslavia) depicted its ethnic relations as ""ancient hatreds,"" implying that the country's ethnic groups cannot peacefully coexist and that the 1992-1995 war was unavoidable. However, many experts on the region reject this thesis. Although Bosnia has experienced episodes of communal violence and bloodshed, most recently during World War II and the 1992-1995 war, its heterogeneous population also has lived in mixed communities for periods of peace. Many experts contend that ethnic conflict often was stoked by domestic leaders who manipulated historical memory and grievances to further their own agendas, or by external powers seeking to rule Bosnia or annex its territory. In the 1980s, Yugoslavia's escalating political and economic crises fueled nationalist movements. Nationalist leaders in Serbia and Croatia appealed to Bosnian Serbs and Croats as ethnic ""kin."" The party that ruled Croatia for most of the 1990s, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), established a sister party with the same name to mobilize Bosnian Croats and compete in Bosnia's elections. This gave Croatia an avenue of influence in Bosnian politics. Serbia, led by strongman Slobodan Milošević, likewise had influence over Bosnian Serb leaders. In Bosnia's November 1990 elections—the first competitive elections in decades—voters cast aside the ruling League of Communists party and elected ethnic parties that largely continue to dominate today. Bosnian voters backed independence in a 1992 referendum, following in the footsteps of Slovenia, Croatia, and Macedonia. Bosnian Serbs, who did not want to separate from Yugoslavia, boycotted the referendum. Bosnian Serb forces seized more than two-thirds of Bosnia's territory, and a three-year conflict followed that pitted Serb, Croat, and Bosniak forces against one another. Bosnian Serb leaders declared a ""Serb Republic"" ( Republika Srpska) in March 1992, while Bosnian Croat leaders proclaimed the Croat Community of Herceg-Bosnia in July. Some Bosnian Croat and Bosnian Serb leaders advocated unification with Croatia and Serbia, respectively, where government factions—including their strongman leaders—likewise wanted to carve a Greater Croatia and Greater Serbia out of Bosnia's territory. Bosniak leaders opposed dismemberment of the state. Bosnia's war was one of the most lethal conflicts in Europe since World War II. Bosnian Serb forces besieged Sarajevo for 44 months. More than 10,000 people, mostly civilians, died due to shelling, sniping, and blockade-related deprivation. Paramilitary factions from neighboring Croatia and Serbia—some of which reportedly had ties to the Croatian and Serbian government—fought alongside Bosnian Croats and Serbs. The Serb-dominated Yugoslav National Army also aided Bosnian Serb forces, giving them a military advantage. In many areas, combatants from the three groups killed or expelled members of other ethnic groups to ""purify"" territory that they wanted to claim as their own. This ""ethnic cleansing"" changed Bosnia's demographic landscape. An estimated 100,000 or more Bosnians were killed in the conflict, and roughly half of its population displaced. In addition, an estimated 20,000 or more women and girls were victims of sexual violence. Hundreds of Bosnians have been prosecuted for war crimes at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and in Bosnian courts. In 2016, the ICTY convicted wartime Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadžić of genocide and war crimes. In 2019, the tribunal rejected his appeal and increased his sentence from 40 years to life. Citizens of Croatia and Serbia have also been indicted for crimes committed in the Bosnian war. Highly publicized incidents in 1994 and 1995 underscored the war's human toll. Bosnian Serb forces bombarded a Sarajevo market in 1994 and 1995, resulting in over 100 civilian deaths. In July 1995, Serb forces commanded by Ratko Mladić seized and executed more than 8,000 Bosniak men and boys in a U.N.-designated safe area around the city of Srebrenica, an incident subsequently seen by some as a consequence of the international community's muddled, ineffectual response to the conflict. The International Court of Justice and ICTY subsequently ruled that the Srebrenica massacres constituted an act of genocide. Mladić was convicted of genocide and other crimes in 2017. These incidents increased pressure on U.S. policymakers to take a stronger role in resolving a conflict that had largely been left to the EU and the United Nations. Under U.S. command, NATO intervened in August and September 1995 with air strikes against Bosnian Serb targets, while allied Bosniak and Croat forces launched a simultaneous offensive in western Bosnia. The United States played a key role in brokering several agreements. The 1994 Washington Agreement ended the ""war within a war"" between Bosniaks and Croats. In November 1995, leaders from Croatia, Bosnia, and Serbia met at the Wright-Patterson Air Force base in Dayton, OH, to negotiate a peace agreement. U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke played a crucial role in brokering the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, more commonly known as the Dayton Peace Agreement. Bosnia's complex political system is a product of the Dayton Agreement; one of its annexes serves as Bosnia's constitution (Annex 4). Its provisions partly reflect the situation on the ground in 1995, including the subdivision of Bosnia into two ethnoterritorial entities ( Figure 1 ): Republika Srpska (""RS""), which Bosnian Serb leaders had proclaimed in 1992, and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (""FBiH,"" predominantly populated by Bosniaks and Croats), which was created by the 1994 Washington Agreement. Entity borders were largely drawn to form ethnic majorities, even though they also reflected territorial seizure and ethnic cleansing. Many Bosniaks view the division of Bosnia into these roughly equal entities as awarding the spoils of war to Bosnian Serbs, whom they regard as the aggressors. Many Bosnian Serbs, however, view the Serb-majority entity as a protection against marginalization. The designation of Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs as Bosnia's three ""constituent peoples"" is a cornerstone of the Dayton system. Numerous government bodies have ethnic quotas requiring equal representation of the three groups. In these power-sharing institutions, delegates from each constituent group may veto measures that go against vital ethnic interests. While these arrangements make Bosnia's political system prone to gridlock, Dayton's negotiators viewed them as necessary to prevent any group from feeling marginalized in a context of low trust. Bosnia is a parliamentary republic with a high degree of decentralization. Its complex, tiered structure includes a central (""state-level"") government, the two entities, the autonomous Brčko district, and cantonal and municipal governments. The central (""state-level"") government covers the entirety of Bosnia. A three-member presidency is the head of state, and includes one Serb member who is elected by RS voters, and one Bosniak and one Croat member elected by FBiH voters. The Council of Ministers, led by a Chairperson, is roughly equivalent to a cabinet government and prime minister in other parliamentary systems. The Parliamentary Assembly is a state-level legislature with two chambers: a directly elected House of Representatives (42 members) and an indirectly elected House of Peoples (5 Serbs, 5 Croats, and 5 Bosniaks). The state-level government is considered to be weak, despite some expansion of its functions in the 2000s. Its major responsibilities include foreign relations; trade, customs, and monetary policy; migration and asylum policy; defense; and intelligence. Bosnia is further subdivided into two ethnoterritorial entities: Republika Srpska (RS), where Serbs are the largest ethnic group (82%), and the Federation entity (FBiH), where Bosniaks (70%) and Croats (22%) are the largest groups. The two entities have broader policy jurisdiction than the state-level government. Governing functions that are not assigned to the state-level government fall to the entities. These include civilian policing, economic policy, fiscal policy, energy policy, and health and social policy, as well as other issues. Each entity has its own constitution, as well as a president, vice presidents, legislature, and cabinet government with a prime minister. Each entity may establish ""special parallel relationships"" with neighboring states (i.e., Croatia and Serbia). Numerous entity bodies also incorporate ethnic quotas. Brčko district, a border region in northeastern Bosnia, was initially administered by the international community to allay concerns about RS secession. Brčko's location interrupts RS's contiguity, and both entities initially claimed it. Brčko was later awarded to both entities, but remains a self-governing district whose population is a mix of all three constituent peoples. Some analysts believe it has been relatively more successful than the entities in passing reforms and reintegrating its divided population (e.g., ethnically mixed schools with a common curriculum). FBiH entity is further divided into ten cantons, many of which were drawn to form ethnic Bosniak or Croat majorities. The cantons have jurisdiction in many policy areas, including policing, housing, culture, and education. They also have their own constitutions—based on the FBiH constitution—as well as legislatures and cabinet-style governments. FBiH and RS are further divided into 79 and 64 municipalities, respectively. The Dayton Agreement established a strong oversight role for the international community. The Office of the High Representative (OHR) was created to monitor the implementation of civilian aspects of Dayton. The High Representative is supported by the Peace Implementation Council (PIC), a group of 55 countries and agencies. A 1997 PIC conference empowered the High Representative to impose binding decisions and sanction politicians who obstruct Dayton. Until the mid-2000s, the High Representative used these powers to remove officials deemed to be obstructive to peace and to promote what are considered among the most constructive reforms since Dayton, including merging the entities' armed forces and intelligence services and putting them under new state-level ministries. However, the High Representative's proactive role has since decreased. This is partly due to criticism that the OHR lacks democratic legitimacy and accountability. Bosnian Serb politicians have claimed that the OHR's interventions support Bosniak leaders' preference for a more centralized state. At the same time, some U.S. and EU policymakers believed that the attraction of EU membership could incentivize reforms in place of the OHR's more top-down approach. The international community also plays an ongoing security role. NATO led the Implementation Force (IFOR) and the smaller Stabilization Force (SFOR) that monitored security aspects of the Dayton Peace Agreement. The initial deployment of NATO ground forces to Bosnia numbered nearly 60,000, of which the largest share (approximately one-third) was from the United States. The number of troops subsequently decreased. In 2004, NATO's peacekeeping role was transferred to the EU with the understanding that NATO would assist if necessary. The size of the EU operation (EUFOR Althea) decreased from 7,000 troops in 2004 to roughly 600 troops today. Many analysts contend that the Dayton Agreement helped hold Bosnia together after the war; they point to the absence of widespread violence since 1995 as an indicator of its success. However, observers also question whether Bosnia can function much longer under the Dayton system. They identify several key challenges: Critics claim that Bosnia's political system reinforces the country's ethnic divisions and makes ethnicity a core basis of political identity. The ethnic parties that have dominated politics since the war generally appeal to voters from their respective ethnic communities rather than all Bosnians. Critics accuse ethnic party leaders of inflaming nationalist tensions and manipulating historical memory to distract from corruption and win elections, thus aggravating rather than bridging the deep wounds that remain from the war. In some parts of Bosnia, divisions are further reproduced at the societal level through institutions like segregated schools, which separate schoolchildren from different ethnic groups and teach them different curriculum. Some analysts also contend that the system is too gridlock-prone to pass major political and economic reforms to be passed, even with the incentive of potential EU membership. Bosnia's fractured, overlapping institutions sometimes muddle policymaking jurisdiction and impede coordinated response. Furthermore, power-sharing arrangements create numerous veto points in the legislative process. Government coalitions are typically ideologically broad and unwieldy, creating a further source of potential dysfunction. One of the consequences of these barriers is that it is difficult to pass legislation. The previous state-level Parliament, for example, adopted twelve new laws over the course of its 2014-2018 term. Corruption in Bosnia has roots in the country's wartime economy. A 2000 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report stated that ""organized crime and corruption pervade Bosnia's national political parties, civil service, law enforcement and judicial systems. [Ethnic] parties control all aspects of the government, the judiciary, and the economy, and in so doing maintain the personal and financial power of their members."" Many observers claim that the situation has improved little since then. In 2018, the High Representative warned that the rule of law has deteriorated, while the U.S. State Department describes the rule of law as ""an existential issue."" Bosnia's major parties allegedly siphon from the state apparatus and public enterprises in their strongholds to amass wealth and power. Furthermore, parties in power reportedly politicize hiring in Bosnia's public sector, which employs an estimated third or more of the working population. For many Bosnians, satisfactory employment depends on having the right political connections, which creates a dependence that reportedly is exploited during elections. In 2018, the outgoing U.S. ambassador to Bosnia decried the ""[Bosnian] politicians who seek to destabilize the country in order to remain in power at all costs for personal profit and protection."" Many analysts believe that Bosnia's entrenched ethnic parties benefit tremendously from the status quo and have little incentive to reform the system. Bosnia's MPs are among the best-paid in Europe relative to local incomes, commanding six to eight times the average Bosnian salary. Parties and politicians who gain office in the government or administration often find ""a remarkably efficient path to personal enrichment."" Politicians are skilled at using veto points to block legislation that threatens their position in Bosnia's patronage system. According to one analyst, Bosnia's patronage system is ""the raison d'etre of the political elites and is the main cause of the state's dysfunctionality and resistance to reform."" Bosnia's entrenched political class may also fear penalty if serious reforms are enacted and shine the spotlight on malfeasance. Criminal indictments against leaders in neighborhood countries like Romania, Croatia, and North Macedonia highlight this risk. Analysts believe these disincentives make entrenched politicians resistant to external pressure for reform. Several major rounds of U.S.- and EU-brokered constitutional reform efforts, including in 2006, 2008, and 2009, ultimately failed. Germany and the United Kingdom launched a major initiative in 2014 to shift the focus from difficult constitutional reforms to seemingly more feasible socioeconomic reforms that they hoped would improve Bosnia's economy and dismantle patronage networks. The 2015 ""Reform Agenda"" identified economic, administrative, and legal measures to be adopted by entity- and state-level governments. The process, which required the major parties to commit in writing to the reform framework, was supported by the EU, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank Group, and the United States. As an incentive for politicians to agree to the Agenda, the EU offered the entry into force of Bosnia's long-stalled Stabilization and Association Agreement, which marked the first step toward EU membership. However, most observers view the Reform Agenda as largely unsuccessful; many of its provisions failed when entrenched parties objected to measures that would undercut their dominance. While many officials recognize that Bosnia's political system needs reform, there is little consensus on how to change it or to generate the political will to find common ground so long as the dominant parties remain entrenched. Bosnian Serb leaders have expressed a desire to return to the ""original"" Dayton system, when the entities had greater competencies in security and justice. Milorad Dodik, who has dominated politics in Republika Srpska since the 2000s, has gone further by repeatedly threatening RS secession. Bosnian Croat leaders from the largest Croat party, the Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia (HDZ-BiH), call for more autonomy for Croats, and have raised the prospect of splitting FBiH to create a third Croat-majority entity. By contrast, Bosniak leaders generally prefer more centralization and the removal of some of the institutional arrangements that they believe contribute to dysfunction and gridlock. Some Bosniak officials also have proposed dismantling the entities or eliminating FBiH's cantons. Survey research documents Bosnian citizens' anger toward the political class and their distrust of political institutions. In a 2018 International Republican Institute survey, 86% of respondents expressed belief that Bosnia is heading in the wrong direction. An estimated 170,000 individuals—disproportionately young and skilled—have emigrated since 2013. Dissatisfaction with education and healthcare, insecurity, and nepotism are cited as key motives to emigrate. Nevertheless, some analysts believe that periods of social discontent in 2014 and 2018, which challenged the system but appeared to transcend ethnic divides, suggest that strengthening Bosnian civil society could increase pressure for reform, and perhaps cultivate a new generation of party leaders. Other observers have put their hopes for reform in Bosnia's so-called ""civic parties,"" which do not have nationalist platforms and typically mobilize voters on the basis of socioeconomic interests rather than ethnicity. While these parties have not matched the results of the ethnic parties, their electoral performance has improved in recent years. Bosnia's challenges came to the forefront during its most recent general election on October 7, 2018 (see Table 1 ). The Central Election Commission (CEC) registered 60 parties and over 3,500 candidates for state-level, entity, and cantonal offices. Observers noted that the campaign climate was more divisive and nationalist in tone than usual. Despite broad voter dissatisfaction, entrenched ethnic parties won the largest vote shares. Almost six months after the election, the parties are still negotiating over government formation at the state level and in FBiH; however, it appears that entrenched ethnic parties will continue to dominate. In March 2019, the leaders of the largest Bosniak, Croat, and Serb parties stated that they had agreed to a set of principles to guide forming the state-level government (the Council of Ministers). Some observers viewed the improved result of civic parties (one-third of the vote in FBiH) as a positive development. Some of the most controversial outcomes concern the elections to the state-level presidency, composed of three members (one Bosniak, one Croat, and one Serb). In a closely fought race, Šefik Džaferović, candidate of the ethnic Bosniak SDA party, narrowly defeated the candidate of the civic SDP party (36.6% and 33.5%, respectively), retaining the lock that the SDA has had on the Bosniak seat in most elections since 1996, but perhaps auguring a future victory by a civic party candidate. Prior to the election, some analysts expressed concern at the prospect of two of the three seats on the presidency being held by the nationalist Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik and his ally, the nationalist Bosnian Croat politician Dragan Čović. Both politicians have explicitly or implicitly challenged the legitimacy of Bosnian statehood and called for greater ethnoterritorial autonomy. However, to the surprise of some observers, Željko Komšić of the civic Democratic Front defeated incumbent Čović for the Croat seat with 53% of the vote. Komšić was previously elected as the Croat member of the presidency in 2006 and 2010, and is considered to be a moderate political figure who generally supports centralizing reforms. In contrast to HDZ-BiH leader Čović, he does not have strong ties to the Croatian government. Komšić's election as the Croat member of the presidency in 2006 and 2010 was mired in controversy amid complaints that he only won with the support of Bosniaks who voted in the election for the Croat member on the presidency rather than the Bosniak member. Komšić identifies as Croat but has been leader of several civic parties. He comes from central Bosnia, and not from the Croat-majority western regions that are the stronghold of the HDZ. Although it is not illegal for Bosniaks to vote for the Croat seat on the presidency rather than the Bosniak seat, some Croat leaders (especially HDZ-BiH and HDZ-1990) claim that it violates the spirit of Dayton and results in illegitimate representation of Croats. Similar accusations of ethnic cross-voting surfaced after Komšić's victory in 2018. Some analysts expect Komšić's victory to harden the HDZ-BiH position on electoral reform (see ""Legal Challenges,"" above) and possibly embolden politicians who seek a separate entity. As most pre-election polls anticipated, RS strongman Milorad Dodik defeated the more moderate incumbent Serb member of the presidency with 54% of the vote. Dodik has dominated entity politics in RS since the mid-2000s as entity prime minister and president. Analysts note that RS's political environment grew more closed as Dodik consolidated power. Dodik has run afoul of the United States and the EU by frequently threatening to hold a referendum on RS secession, questioning the legitimacy of Bosnian statehood, and cultivating close ties to Russia (see below). The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned him in 2017 for actively obstructing Dayton. Many analysts have expressed concern that Dodik will use his new position to obstruct the workings of the central government while continuing to dictate politics in RS through loyal allies. Shortly after the election he vowed to ""work above all and only for the interests of Serbs."" One of his first acts as head of state was to call for Bosnia to recognize Ukraine's Crimea region as Russian territory. In December 2018, the National Assembly of RS approved the creation of several new ministries, an act that some view as an attempt to wrest competencies from the state-level government. In early 2019, the RS parliament courted controversy when it passed legislation to create a new commission to reinvestigate the events of Srebrenica, which many view as an attempt to deny or downplay the massacres. Since the election, the formation of governments has proceeded piecemeal, and legal challenges to election law in FBiH (see above, ""Legal Challenges"") initially cast doubt over the formation of that entity's government. The RS National Assembly approved the new entity government in December 2018. Party leaders continue to negotiate over forming governments in FBiH and the state-level Council of Ministers. Because the FBiH government did not fix electoral legislation before the election, the Electoral Commission adopted a decision to assign delegates to the House of Peoples based on the 2013 census. (The Electoral Commission's actions reportedly came amid strong pressure from U.S. and EU officials). Several Bosniak parties challenged the decision before the Constitutional Court; however, the Court declined to take on the case. Bosnia is one of Europe's poorest countries. The 1992-1995 war caused an estimated $110 billion in damage, and Bosnia's economy contracted to one-eighth of its prewar level. Despite significant reconstruction and recovery since 1995, GDP per capita was $5,148 in 2017, well below the EU average ($33,715) and that of Bulgaria ($8,031), its lowest-ranking member. Nearly one in five Bosnians lives below the poverty level. Bosnia's unemployment rate was 18% in 2018, down from 28% in 2015. Youth unemployment also declined in recent years from 60% to 46%. Nevertheless, these rates are still high by European standards. Since 2015, annual GDP growth has averaged around 3%, but it is largely driven by consumption (much of which in turn is fueled by migrant remittances). The IMF has urged Bosnia to privatize or restructure the nearly 550 state-owned enterprises that comprise roughly 20% of its economy; many of them are unprofitable but allegedly are used by politicians as ""cash cows and workplaces for loyal cadres."" Bosnia participates in several free trade schemes. In 2006, it joined the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) alongside other non-EU countries in the region, including other ex-Yugoslav neighbors. Bosnia's Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the European Union, which entered into force in 2015, provides for almost fully free trade. A free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) also entered into force in 2015. The EU is Bosnia's primary trade partner. Germany, Italy, Croatia, Slovenia, and Austria are Bosnia's key EU export markets, accounting for more than half of its exports in 2017. Serbia, another CEFTA signatory, is also an important export market. Bosnia's major exports include vehicle seats, raw materials, leather products, textiles, energy, and wood products. The EU is also Bosnia's primary source of foreign direct investment (FDI). In 2016, 63% of Bosnia's FDI came from EU countries, with Austria, Croatia, and Slovenia the top sources. Serbia is also a significant source of FDI (16.3%). However, Bosnia's fragmented legal and administrative structure create a challenging investment climate. Many relevant laws differ between the two entities. Corruption, entrenched economic interests, and political instability also deter investment. As a result, FDI amounts to just 2% of Bosnia's GDP, well below the Western Balkan average of 5%. Bosnia was the region's lowest-rated country in the World Bank's 2019 Ease of Doing Business Index. U.S. and EU policymakers view the NATO and EU accession processes as a positive force for democratization and reform in the Western Balkans, including Bosnia. According to analysts, this assessment informed the United States' partial retreat from the region in the 2000s and 2010s. EU membership is one of the few policy issues for which there is relatively broad consensus among Bosnia's politicians and population. The EU's ""fundamentals first"" approach to enlargement in the Western Balkans frontloads the accession process with meeting the core requirements of having a democratic political system and functioning market economy; in Bosnia, the EU is currently focused on issues relating to the rule of law, public administration reform, and economic development. In 2016, Bosnia submitted its application to join the EU. Its current status is potential candidate , which entitles it to receive financial assistance from the EU's Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance II (IPA II). Between 2014 and 2020, Bosnia is expected to receive €552 million in IPA II allocations, making the EU Bosnia's largest source of foreign assistance. Many EU member states provide additional aid to Bosnia through domestic foreign assistance programs. Bosnia's EU membership prospects are uncertain. In a 2018 progress report, the European Commission (the EU's executive) flagged Bosnia's slow implementation of reforms, including the 2015 Reform Agenda (a flagship EU initiative in Bosnia) and numerous domestic and international court rulings (see ""Legal Challenges,"" above). Some analysts question whether Bosnia, under its current political system, would be capable of meeting the membership requirement of harmonizing domestic legislation with the many thousands of provisions in the acquis communautaire, the cumulative body of EU legislation, case law, and regulations. In comparison to EU membership, Bosnian leaders are more divided over the issue of joining NATO. These divisions largely fall along Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat/Bosniak lines. Bosnian Serb opposition is rooted in resentment over NATO's role in the Bosnian war, and may also reflect a desire to remain in lockstep with neighboring Serbia, which also does not seek NATO membership. Bosnia joined NATO's Partnership for Peace in 2006 and secured an Individual Partnership Action Plan in 2008. In 2010, NATO indicated that it would launch a Membership Action Plan (MAP)—a program to help aspiring members meet membership requirements—once Bosnia meets several conditions, the most challenging of which is the reregistration of permanent defense installations from entity to state-level government. RS officials have resisted ceding control over defense installations on entity territory. Although Bosnia does not yet meet these requirements, in December 2018 NATO foreign ministers invited Bosnia to activate its MAP by submitting its first Annual National Program. Some analysts interpreted this invitation as a gesture to generate reform momentum in Bosnia's fragile post-election period. The Bosniak and Croat members of the presidency responded positively, but Bosnian Serb leaders (and most Bosnian Serbs) do not want Bosnia to join NATO. In October 2017, the RS National Assembly passed a resolution supporting military neutrality. RS President Željka Cvijanović reiterated this stance after NATO's invitation, and Dodik—now a member of the state-level presidency—also has vowed to pursue military neutrality. Bosnia's relations with Croatia and Serbia are seen as an important component of regional stability. However, bilateral relations have often been fraught as a legacy of the Bosnian war, as well as sensitivities over Croatia and Serbia's relations with Bosnian Croats and Serbs. While democratic gains in Croatia and Serbia after 2000 contributed to improved relations with Bosnia, they remain reluctant to examine or acknowledge their role in the Bosnian war. At times, Bosnian leaders have objected to what they describe as Croatian and Serbian meddling in Bosnia's affairs. Ex-Bosnian Croat member of the presidency Dragan Čović and current Bosnian Serb member of the presidency Milorad Dodik draw support from leaders in Croatia and Serbia and reportedly hold Croatian and Serbian citizenship, respectively, alongside their Bosnian citizenship. The Croatian government financially and politically backed Čović in Bosnia's 2018 elections, and Croatian politicians have raised the issue of Bosnian Croats' constitutional challenges (see above, ""Legal Challenges"") in forums like the European Parliament, NATO, and the United Nations. These moves prompted three former High Representatives to Bosnia to issue a joint letter expressing alarm over Croatia's ""meddling"" in Bosnia's internal affairs. The Croatian government also challenged the legitimacy of Željko Komšić as the Croat member of the Bosnian presidency (see above, ""2018 General Election""). Some parties in Croatia hold Croatian election campaign events on Bosnian territory to mobilize Bosnian Croat voters with dual citizenship to vote in Croatia's elections. The Serbian government likewise supports Dodik, who is a frequent visitor to Belgrade. Some Serbian politicians have made statements supporting convicted Bosnian Serb war criminals, inflaming an issue that remains highly sensitive in Bosnia. Bosnia and Serbia have an unresolved demarcation dispute over approximately 40 square kilometers of border area, including a railway segment and hydroelectric power stations. Bosnia has dual citizenship treaties with Croatia and Serbia, resulting in hundreds of thousands of Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Serbs acquiring dual citizenship. This has raised jurisdictional issues in cases in which indicted war criminals hold dual citizenship. Despite occasional tensions in their relations, Croatia and Serbia are important economic partners for Bosnia. Both countries are among Bosnia's top export markets and top sources of FDI. As part of its enlargement strategy in the Western Balkans, the EU has embraced a connectivity agenda to improve regional transportation, energy, and infrastructural linkages, reserving up to €1 billion in grants for projects for the period 2015-2020. Officials believe that improved connectivity could benefit bilateral relations and contribute to regional stability. Given its strategic location and relatively small, weak states, the Balkan region has long drawn in more powerful states. Many analysts maintain that as the United States and the European Union have both scaled back their presence in the Balkans to address other issues since the late 2000s, Russia, Turkey, and China partly filled the vacuum. U.S. and EU officials have expressed concern over Russian influence in the Western Balkans, particularly after Russia occupied Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014. Many analysts maintain that Russia does not have a grand strategy in the Western Balkans, but rather aims to prevent Euro-Atlantic integration and shore up its claims to great power status by asserting itself in the EU's ""inner courtyard."" Analysts have identified several Russian tools in the region, including playing a ""spoiler"" role, projecting soft power, and leveraging energy dominance. Observers contend that Russia plays a ""spoiler"" role in Bosnia by exacerbating ethnic divisions, backing illiberal or anti-Western political factions, and helping to militarize RS. They claim that these actions help sustain the dysfunction and gridlock that undermine Bosnia's Euro-Atlantic reform efforts. Russia has supported Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat nationalist leaders Milorad Dodik and Dragan Čović. Dodik's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin just before Bosnia's October 7, 2018 general election was one of nearly ten meetings between the two over the past three years, signaling high-level Russian support. Many experts assert that Russia has been a key ally to Dodik in resisting Western pressure to cooperate on reforms. Moscow has also supported divisive RS policies. When Dodik violated a Bosnian Constitutional Court ruling in 2016 by holding a referendum to establish a controversial ""Statehood Day,"" Russia stood apart from the High Representative and Western diplomats by supporting the initiative. More recently, Russia stated its support for RS's controversial Srebrenica commission (see above). Analysts have also expressed concern at Russia's apparent support for Čović, who has advocated greater autonomy for Croats and the creation of a third Croat entity. Some analysts have expressed concern at Russia's role in RS's security sector. Russian forces have trained RS police special forces on counterterrorism and intelligence. Some observers believe that these exercises contribute to militarization in RS, potentially pushing the police force beyond its civilian law enforcement mandate. Analysts caution that militarization could increase the scale of violence in any confrontation between RS and the Bosnian government. Some Bosnian Serb ultranationalist and veterans groups have fought alongside pro-Russia combatants in Ukraine, and analysts believe they could be mobilized to support RS leaders as well. Russian soft power draws upon religious and cultural kinship with Bosnian Serbs, as well as Russia's history of support during the wars of Yugoslav disintegration. Kremlin-linked media, like Sputnik and RT , amplify existing anti-Western narratives and positively shape public opinion toward Russia. Some local media further propagate Sputnik and RT articles. A 2018 National Democratic Institute media study found that RS media stories about Russia were overwhelmingly positive, while the tone of most stories about the United States and NATO was negative. Pro-Russian media glorifies the Russian military, highlights cultural and religious links between Serbs and Russians, and documents high-level meetings between RS and Russian officials. Economic relations between Russia and RS have deepened in recent years. Russia is the largest source of FDI in RS, and it is largely concentrated in the energy sector. In 2007, Russian state-owned oil company Zarubezhneft bought RS's Bosanski Brod oil refinery, motor oil processing facilities in nearby Modrica, and retailer Banjaluka Petrol. Some analysts believe that these assets—which were purchased without an open tender—give Zarubezhneft influence in RS. In addition to being an important employer, Zarubezhneft is RS's biggest taxpayer; its value-added tax and excise duty contributions reportedly account for 25% of RS budget revenue. Bosnia depends upon Russian natural gas imports via Ukraine. Energy policy is vested in the entities, and Russian natural gas provider Gazprom reportedly has used its market dominance to pit the two entities against one another and undermine projects that would diversify supplies. Many analysts believe that Turkey's influence in Bosnia has increased over the last two decades due to Ankara's close relationship with Bosniak leaders. Some Turkish officials reportedly view Bosnia as a natural sphere of influence given geographic and historical connections. Observers note that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has at times invoked Ottoman-era ties to Bosnia and religious kinship with Bosniaks as soft power tools. Turkish influence in Bosnia has expanded since Yugoslavia's collapse. During the 1992-1995 war, Turkey gained prestige among Bosniaks by condemning the international arms embargo against Bosnia, arguing that it prevented Bosniaks from defending themselves. Turkey, as well as other predominantly Muslim countries like Iran and Saudi Arabia, reportedly supplied Bosniak forces with arms. Turkish influence has continued since the war's end. Bosnia is one of the top recipients of Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency assistance; much of this support is earmarked for projects to restore Ottoman-era buildings and monuments. A Turkish Cultural Center was established in Bosnia in 2003, and in 2009 the Yunus Emre Foundation, an NGO founded by the Turkish government, opened an office in Sarajevo to promote Turkish language and culture. Turkey has popular support among Bosniaks. In a 2018 International Republican Institute survey, 76% of Bosniak respondents had positive views of Turkey—the strongest support among Bosniaks for any foreign state. Many Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Serbs look to Croatia and Serbia as external protectors, and some analysts believe that Turkey has attempted to establish a similar role for itself vis-à-vis Bosniaks. Observers contend that Erdogan's ruling party has particularly strong ties to the largest Bosniak ethnic party, the SDA. Erdogan and Turkish state-owned media openly supported SDA candidate Bakir Izetbegović in his bid for the Bosniak seat on the presidency in 2014. Some observers believe that Izetbegović's clout within the SDA rests in part on his support from Erdogan. Economic relations between Bosnia and Turkey have deepened in recent years. Turkish FDI in Bosnia accounted for 5.6% of FDI flows in 2016. One notable project is a highway to connect Sarajevo to Belgrade, Serbia. After years of disagreement, Bosnian officials approved the route in February 2019. Turkey is expected to provide funding for some of the expected €3 billion in costs, although the terms of the contract are not yet resolved. Some officials, including French President Emmanuel Macron, have expressed concern over Turkey's alleged ambitions as part of broader EU concern over external influence in the Balkans. However, analysts caution that Turkey's ambitions and capabilities in the Balkans may be overstated. They note that the scope of Turkish investment is sometimes exaggerated in the media, and that proposed projects do not always come to fruition. While Russian and Turkish influence in Bosnia relies in part on soft power, China's presence in Bosnia is primarily economic. Between 2011 and 2019, Chinese investments in Bosnia amounted to an estimated $3.6 billion, primarily in the form of direct lending for energy and transportation projects. Chinese firms have contracts to construct or expand energy plants, including a €350 million loan to construct a coal-fired plant in Stanari, RS. A €1.4 billion deal was signed to construct a highway between Banja Luka and Mlinište. In March 2019, the EU Energy Community criticized the FBiH entity government's decision to guarantee a €600 million loan from China's Exim Bank to build a coal-fired power plant in Tuzla. However, some analysts caution that China's economic influence in Bosnia may be overstated at present. While China's pledged investments in high-visibility projects garner media attention, the actual amount of Chinese FDI is far less than that of the EU. Moreover, many pledged projects do not come to fruition. Nevertheless, EU and U.S. officials have voiced concern over the scope of China's investments in the Balkans, as well as Chinese lending practices. Chinese loans often require recipient state governments to assume the loan burden, potentially leading to high external debt. The EU has also raised concerns that Chinese lending practices violate EU rules in public procurement because they frequently require use of Chinese contractors, laborers, or supplies. In contrast to EU funds, which are partly designed to spur reform, Chinese loans have few conditions and rules linked to transparency or reform. Finally, EU officials have expressed concern that China's economic might could be a source of leverage over recipient states that are candidates or potential candidates for EU membership and thus impede the EU's ability to speak with one voice on relations with China if they do become members. Bosnia was not a core transit country in the ""Balkan Route"" that hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees followed in an attempt to reach the EU during heightened flows in 2015 and early 2016. However, recent route shifts have brought more migrant and refugee traffic through Bosnia. Since early 2018, an estimated 23,000 migrants and refugees have entered Bosnia; approximately 25% of them remain in the country. Most of them hope to enter EU territory via Bosnia's neighbor, Croatia, and from there move on and enter the EU's visa- and passport-free Schengen Area. However, the Croatian government has expanded border policing, and apprehended individuals are sent back to Bosnia. The EU provided €2 million in 2018 to help Bosnia respond to the crisis and provide shelter to migrants and refugees who are effectively stranded in Bosnia. The migration crisis has triggered a backlash from some Bosnians, particularly in Una-Sana Canton, which borders Croatia and has the highest concentration of migrants and refugees. Some residents of Bihać, Una-Sana's administrative center, protested against camps situated in their municipality in October 2018, while local authorities in Velika Kladuša, another city in the canton, reportedly obstructed the Ministry of Security's plans to house migrants in a local building. The incident illustrates local backlash as well as the state-level government's difficulty enforcing its decisions, even when it has jurisdiction. Islam was introduced to part of Bosnia's population during Ottoman rule. In socialist Yugoslavia, the semi-official Islamic Religious Community played a key role in religious affairs, including legal rulings and religious education. It was renamed the Islamic Community of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992, and remains an important religious institution. Islamic tradition in the Balkans, including Bosnia, is generally moderate and secular. The majority of Bosnia's practicing Muslims follow the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam. However, some analysts have expressed concern over the emergence of groups influenced or funded by state and non-state entities in the Arab Gulf states, where more conservative Hanbali Sunni practices are common. Aid workers, missionaries, and ""mujahedeen"" fighters from the Gulf States promoted transnational Islamist militancy and Salafist Hanbali religious doctrine during Bosnia's 1992-1995 war; Iran's government also supported Bosniak leaders and forces. After the war, Saudi Arabia provided an estimated $600 million in aid to repair and build hundreds of mosques and establish schools and cultural centers that promote socially conservative Sunni views. Iran has also maintained active cultural outreach and other ties to some Bosnian Muslims. Many analysts contend that Salafi groups have limited support in Bosnia because of the traditionally high level of secularism among Bosnian Muslims. They also note that few Bosnian Muslims who subscribe to Salafist ideas and practices have violent intentions, and many of them live in remote rural communities. While most of these groups were not originally affiliated with official religious organizations in Bosnia, the Grand Mufti of Bosnia's Islamic Community exerted pressure on them to acknowledge his authority and his right to monitor religious content. As a result, an estimated 90% of Salafi groups were brought under official structures. Nevertheless, some experts caution that radicalized groups and individuals may pose a terrorist threat despite their small numbers. Radicalized Muslims were implicated in the bombing of a police station in Bugojno in 2010 and a lone-gunman attack on the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo in 2011. The Islamic State (IS) and Nusra Front's gains in Syria and Iraq in the 2010s altered the dynamic of the terrorism threat in Bosnia and broadened the use of social media in recruitment. Between 2012 and 2017, an estimated 350 Bosnian citizens traveled from Bosnia or Bosnian diaspora communities to fight with armed groups in Iraq and Syria. More recently, returned foreign fighters are seen as a potential threat as the position of the IS and other armed groups has weakened. Bosnia's stock of illegal weapons, mines, and explosives may exacerbate the risk posed by returnees. As of December 2017, officials believed that just over 100 Bosnians remained in Syria (including women and children), roughly 50 had returned to Bosnia, and 70 had been killed in the conflict. In 2014, the Bosnian government introduced new criminal offenses to prosecute foreign terrorist fighters and recruiters. Several dozen returned fighters and domestic recruiters have been convicted of these offenses. While the U.S. State Department describes Bosnia as a ""cooperative counterterrorism partner,"" it warns that Bosnia's political fragmentation and dysfunction could undermine counterterrorism efforts. For example, in 2017 several ministries proposed new measures to tighten counterterrorism efforts; however, they were not enacted due to political gridlock in state-level and FBiH governments. Initially viewed as a ""European problem,"" the Bosnian conflict eventually helped shape the post-Cold War role of the United States and NATO in European security. When the United States assumed greater responsibilities in resolving the conflict, its role was considerable: leading NATO airstrikes, garnering diplomatic support from Russia and European allies, persuading warring parties to agree to a ceasefire, brokering the Dayton Peace Agreement, and deploying 20,000 troops to Bosnia. According to Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. official who brokered the talks, the Bosnian war was a pivotal period in U.S. foreign policy in Europe: ""The three main pillars of [policy]—U.S.-Russian relations, NATO enlargement into Central Europe, and Bosnia—had often worked against each other. Now they reinforced each other: NATO sent its forces out of area for the first time in its history, and Russian troops, under an American commander, were deployed alongside them."" Some analysts and policymakers believe that the United States' strong hand in resolving the conflict and in shaping Bosnia's political system have made it a stakeholder in Bosnia's future. U.S. officials, often in cooperation with the EU, have intervened to defuse crises and broker reform talks. The United States also has imposed sanctions against Bosnian officials: in addition to Dodik (see above), the U.S. State Department publicly designated Bosnian Serb politician Nikola Špirić (Dodik's associate) for ""significant corruption or gross violation of human rights."" U.S. policymakers attach strategic importance to Bosnia's stability; many analysts believe turbulence in Bosnia could reverberate in the Balkans and potentially draw in Croatia and Serbia, while instability in other parts of the region could spill over into Bosnia. When the Trump Administration indicated in 2018 that it would consider supporting a potential Serbia-Kosovo agreement to ""adjust borders"" between the two—a major break with the long-standing EU and U.S. policy to oppose redrawing borders in the Balkans along ethnic lines—some analysts expressed concern that the Administration could reshape long-standing U.S. policy toward Bosnia. However, the new U.S. Ambassador to Bosnia stated in February 2019 that the U.S. will continue to be ""guarantor of Bosnia and Herzegovina's sovereignty and territorial integrity."" On the other hand, many observers also note that U.S. engagement in Bosnia (and the Western Balkans) decreased under the administrations of President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama. During this time U.S. policymakers turned their focus to geopolitical crises and challenges in other parts of the globe while ceding the regional lead to the EU. Indeed, some analysts have urged the United States to assume a greater role in Bosnia, arguing that Bosnia's current crises warrant it, and that the EU and the United States are more effective in the region when they work together. Congressional interest in Bosnia dates back to the 1992-1995 war. Many Members featured prominently in foreign policy debates over U.S. intervention in the conflict. In 2015, the House passed a resolution describing the Srebrenica massacres as a genocide and urging the United States to continue to support Bosnia's territorial integrity ( H.Res. 310 , 114 th Congress). In the 114 th and 115 th Congresses, a bill was introduced in the Senate to establish an enterprise fund to promote economic development and the private sector in Bosnia ( S. 2307 and S. 864 ). In April 2018, the House Foreign Affairs Committee's Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia, and Emerging Threats held a hearing on Bosnia's prospects ahead of its October 2018 elections. Congress's engagement with Bosnia also continues within the broader context of policy concern over the external influence of China, Turkey, and Russia in the Western Balkans and energy security. As a potential candidate for EU membership and NATO partner, Bosnia is eligible for assistance through the Countering Russian Influence Funds under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) enacted in 2017 ( P.L. 115-44 ). Through congressionally approved (and sometimes expanded) foreign assistance appropriations, Bosnia has received more than $2 billion in aid since 1995. Between 1996 and 1999, the United States pledged $1 billion of the $4 billion international commitment to implementing Dayton's civilian provisions and helping to rebuild Bosnia. The cost of U.S. military operations in Bosnia since 1992 is estimated at more than $10 billion ( Appendix I ). Bosnia continues to receive U.S. foreign assistance, although the amount has decreased in recent years. Assistance to Bosnia in FY2015 and FY2016 was approximately $33 million each year. In FY2017, it was $53.5 million, and $41.5 million in FY2018. The Administration requested $21 million for FY2019 and $16.9 million for FY2020. Nearly 25 years after the Dayton Peace Agreement, Bosnia faces many challenges. In considering U.S. relations with Bosnia, Members of Congress may consider the following questions: How can the United States encourage Bosnia's government to incorporate the legal rulings of the Bosnian Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human Rights into election legislation and the constitution? How can U.S. foreign assistance be used to counter Russian influence in Republika Srpska, in particular Russia's close ties to Bosnian Serb politicians and its use of local media and Sputnik to amplify anti-U.S. narratives and project pro-Russia soft power? What are the implications of potential militarization in Republika Srpska? How can the United States effectively address this alleged trend? How can the United States support a successful reform initiative that secures transparency and accountability, and facilitates a political community in which politicians and voters are committed to the Bosnian state and socioeconomic challenges that transcend all three ethnic groups? Can the Germany-U.K. initiative from 2015 be revived, or is it better to start from scratch? Are the approximately 600 troops in the European Union Force mission in Bosnia sufficient to stabilize Bosnia if violence breaks out? If Serbia and Kosovo agree to normalize relations by redrawing their borders, how can U.S. policymakers prevent this development from destabilizing Bosnia, particularly given Milorad Dodik's threats to seek RS secession if Kosovo is ""partitioned""? How can the United States encourage Croatia and Serbia to engage in Bosnia in a manner that helps bridge ethnic divisions and contributes to Bosnia's territorial integrity and sovereignty? Given the pervasiveness of corruption in Bosnia, how can U.S. assistance most effectively be used to counter it? Does foreign assistance contribute to civic groups and independent media that could serve as a check against corruption? \n\n","['Bosnia and Herzegovina (hereafter, ""Bosnia"") drew heavily on U.S. support after gaining independence from Yugoslavia in 1992. The United States helped end the Bosnian war (1992-1995), one of the most lethal conflicts in Europe since the Second World War, by leading NATO airstrikes against Bosnian Serb forces, brokering the Dayton Peace Agreement in 1995, and deploying 20,000 U.S. troops. Some Members of Congress became involved in policy debates over these measures, and Congress monitored and at times challenged the Bush and Clinton Administrations\' response through numerous hearings, resolutions, and legislative proposals. Since 1995, the United States has been a major source of aid to Bosnia and firmly supports its territorial integrity. The United States also supports Bosnia\'s aspirations for NATO and European Union (EU) membership. Today, Bosnia faces serious challenges. Nearly 25 years after the Dayton Agreement, Bosnia continues to use part of the Agreement as its constitution, which divides the country into two ethnoterritorial entities. Critics charge that Bosnia\'s political system is too decentralized to enact the reforms required for NATO and EU membership. They also contend that the ethnic power-sharing arrangements and veto points embedded in numerous government bodies are sources of gridlock. Domestic and international courts have ruled against several aspects of Bosnia\'s constitution, yet the Bosnian government thus far has failed to implement these rulings. Since Bosnia\'s independence, its politics has been dominated by ethnic parties representing the country\'s three main groups: Bosniaks (Slavic Muslims), Croats, and Serbs. These parties have prospered under a system that critics charge lacks transparency and accountability. Critics also maintain that ethnic party leaders use divisive nationalist rhetoric to distract from serious issues affecting the country as a whole, including poverty, unemployment, and stalled political reforms. The Bosnian population exhibits low trust in political parties and the government, and disaffection toward the country\'s elite. U.S. and EU officials brokered several ultimately unsuccessful rounds of constitutional reform negotiations, and continue to call on Bosnia\'s leaders to implement reforms to make governance more efficient and effective, dismantle patronage networks, and bring Bosnia closer to EU and NATO membership. However, there is little consensus among the country\'s leaders on how the country should be reformed. Bosnian Serb leaders from the Serb-majority entity (Republika Srpska) have called for greater autonomy and even secession from Bosnia. Some Bosnian Croat leaders have called for partitioning Bosnia\'s other entity, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to create a separate Croat-majority entity. Bosniak leaders, by contrast, generally prefer a more centralized state. Many analysts caution that any move to partition the country could lead to renewed violence, while greater decentralization could make Bosnia\'s government less functional. U.S. policy has long been oriented toward preserving Bosnia\'s statehood. Bosnia\'s 2018 general elections largely returned to power the same entrenched ethnic parties. Of particular concern is the election of Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik to Bosnia\'s collective presidency. Dodik, a sharp critic of the United States and NATO, has periodically called for a referendum on Republika Srpska\'s secession. He is under U.S. sanctions for obstructing the Dayton Agreement. In addition to these internal challenges, U.S. and EU officials have expressed concern over external influence in the region. Russia reportedly relies on soft power, energy leverage, and ""spoiler"" tactics to influence Bosnia, particularly in the Serb-majority entity. Turkish soft power draws on Bosnia\'s Ottoman-era heritage and Turkey\'s shared religious tradition with Bosniaks. China is a more recent presence in the region, but its heavy investments and lending have prompted concern on both sides of the Atlantic. Policymakers have also expressed concern at the challenges posed by the return of Bosnians who fought with the Islamic State and Nusra Front in Syria and Iraq. Many observers contend that the United States remains a stakeholder in Bosnia\'s future because of its central role in resolving the conflict and shaping the postwar Bosnian state. Given the history of U.S. involvement in Bosnia, Bosnia\'s importance to regional stability in the Balkans, and concerns over Russian and Chinese influence in Bosnia, Members of Congress may be interested in monitoring how the country navigates its internal and external challenges. Congress may also consider future U.S. aid levels to Bosnia and the degree to which such assistance supports the long-standing U.S. policy objectives for Bosnia of territorial integrity, NATO and EU integration, energy security, and resilience against malign influence.']","8598","gov_report","en","None","f8113f184e34b1df24257645d9db41dbec8c2c4e6e4e7e1b","Summary:","gov_report","532","\nThe report provides a comprehensive overview of the complex political and socio-economic situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), a country that emerging from the 1992-1995 war.

Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nDOJ and its components, as well as the judiciary, play important roles in requesting and collecting restitution. DOJ and select components: Prosecutors in DOJ’s Criminal Division and the Criminal Divisions of the 94 USAOs are responsible for overseeing criminal matters, including identifying and notifying victims, determining their losses as part of a case investigation, prosecuting cases and negotiating the terms of plea agreements, of which restitution may be a part. Within DOJ’s Criminal Division, the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section manages DOJ’s Asset Forfeiture Program. As previously stated, FLUs within each USAO undertake activities to collect restitution from offenders in their district. Additionally, all USAOs have asset forfeiture staff responsible for forfeiting property seized by law enforcement agencies because the property was used in criminal activities or purchased with the proceeds of criminal activities. According to EOUSA guidance, coordination between the FLU and Asset Forfeiture units is highly encouraged to use forfeited assets as a means to collect on unpaid restitution debts. DOJ requires each USAO to have its own policies and procedures related to debt collection efforts but allows them discretion in developing these policies and procedures to ensure that they are appropriate for local conditions. DOJ also requires USAOs to have policies and procedures to make early, effective, and coordinated asset investigations and recovery a routine part of every case involving victims but allows USAOs to specify these policies and procedures. DOJ’s EOUSA provides USAOs with management assistance, guidance, training, and administrative support. Among other activities, EOUSA provides management assistance to USAOs by administering internal evaluations for each USAO, which are intended to provide on-site management support for that office. Further, EOUSA provides guidance to enhance offices’ efforts to request and collect restitution. Judiciary: Within the judiciary, the 94 federal district courts order restitution, receipt restitution payments, and disburse restitution to victims. Within the federal district where the offender was convicted, a probation officer prepares the presentence investigation report (PSR) for the court, which includes information on the victim’s losses and an offender’s financial information. Probation officers may obtain this information from DOJ, which has the statutory responsibility for the enforcement and collection of criminal debt. The court uses the PSR, among other things, to determine whether to order restitution. If an offender is released to the community by the court and placed on supervision, probation officers are responsible for ensuring the offender abides by the terms of release, including paying any restitution owed to victims. The Clerk of each District Court is responsible for the receipt of restitution from offenders and for disbursing payments to victims. The Judicial Conference is the national policy-making body for the federal courts. The Conference operates through a network of committees created to address and advise courts on a wide variety of subjects such as information technology, personnel, probation and pretrial services, space and facilities, security, judicial salaries and benefits, budget, defender services, court administration, and rules of practice and procedure. The Judicial Conference has taken policy positions on restitution-related issues and has supported legislative proposals to improve the restitution process. AOUSC is the agency within the judiciary that provides a broad range of legislative, legal, financial, technology, management, administrative, and program support services to federal courts. AOUSC is responsible for carrying out Judicial Conference policies and a primary responsibility of AOUSC is to provide staff support and counsel to the Judicial Conference and its committees. USSC is an independent agency within the judiciary which, among other activities, establishes and promulgates detailed sentencing guidelines that judges are to consider in sentencing offenders convicted of federal crimes, including guidelines on when and how to order restitution. Additionally, each district court is required to submit to USSC a report of each offender’s sentence that includes, among other information, details on the offenses for which the offender was convicted; the sentence imposed on the offender; and if the judge departed from the sentencing guidelines, information on reasons why. USSC maintains a database containing sentencing data on federal offenders convicted of felonies or serious misdemeanors, analyzes it and publishes these data on an annual basis. USSC is also statutorily required to annually report to Congress its analysis of sentencing-related documents, including an accounting of districts USSC believes have not submitted appropriate information to the commission, among other things. During the course of a federal criminal investigation, federal prosecutors identify and notify victims, as well as determine their losses in conjunction with the federal agents investigating the case. If a defendant pleads guilty or is found guilty at trial, the prosecutor has the burden of proving the victims’ losses in court. To facilitate this, a Victim-Witness coordinator within the USAO responsible for the case provides victims the opportunity to explain their losses in detail, usually through a Victim Impact Statement. This information is then to be provided to a federal probation officer who uses it to begin a PSR. To develop the PSR, probation officers use information provided by the USAO and may contact victims and verify the loss amounts. Additionally, probation officers will investigate an offender’s economic circumstances— such as if the offender has a job, any assets or any dependents. If a judge determines that restitution is to be ordered, the judge must order restitution for the full amount of a victim’s losses for offenses without consideration of the economic circumstances of the defendant. Judges may decline to order restitution in certain instances, for example, where restitution is discretionary, or in certain cases where the number of identifiable victims makes restitution impracticable or the complexity of calculating restitution would unduly prolong the sentencing process. If the court does not order restitution, or orders only partial restitution, the judge must provide the reason, and judges usually do so in a written Statement of Reasons document. Figure 1 provides an overview of the federal restitution process. Upon imposition of a restitution debt by the court, FLU staff use two mechanisms to determine the collectability of the debt and what collection actions to take. First, FLU staff classify the debt into one of four categories to determine the extent to which the FLU will pursue enforcement actions to collect upon the debt. FLUs classify debts from a Priority Code 1 debt (indicating that FLUs will make collection of this debt the highest priority) to a Priority Code 4 debt (indicating that FLUs will make collection of this debt the lowest priority). Second, FLUs may suspend collection action on criminal debts, regardless of their categorization, under certain circumstances if they determine the debts are uncollectible. FLU staff may also determine that debts are permanently uncollectible and categorize them as Priority Code 4 debts. If a debtor does not provide payment, FLU staff then use various enforcement actions to collect the restitution debt. These can include, among other actions, filing liens against an offender’s property, coordinating with asset forfeiture staff to use forfeited assets to pay the restitution debt, and garnishing wages an offender may earn. Victims can be compensated for losses with the proceeds of forfeited assets through DOJ’s Asset Forfeiture Program and in accordance with law and regulation. Federal regulations provide that the proceeds from forfeited assets are first used to cover program costs associated with forfeiture-related activities and next to pay valid owners, lien-holders, and federal financial regulatory agencies. Forfeited assets can then be distributed to other victims of crime as compensation for their losses if their loss is a direct result of the commission of the offense underlying forfeiture or a related offense. Any remaining funds from the forfeited asset may be placed into official use, distributed to foreign governments, state or local law enforcement agencies as part of the equitable sharing program to enhance cooperation with federal investigations. When victims are eligible for compensation using forfeited assets, DOJ employs two processes: restoration and remission. The restoration process involves the USAO staff requesting funds on behalf of a victim when there is both an order of forfeiture and an order of restitution. Under the restoration process, USAO staff request DOJ’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section to use the forfeited asset to pay a restitution debt. If DOJ approves the request for restoration, the funds from the forfeited property are then transferred to the Clerk of the Court who disburses this money to the victim. The remission process requires a victim of a crime to directly petition DOJ to receive funds from the forfeited property. According to officials in DOJ’s Criminal Division, the courts may not order restitution on behalf of victims who suffered a specific actual loss as a direct result of a crime for a variety of reasons, and therefore the remission process serves as a complement to the restoration process to ensure victims are made whole. For example, these officials stated that, among other reasons, the courts may not order restitution if a defendant dies prior to sentencing or if the case is one in which a court is not required to, and does not, order restitution, but the victim has suffered eligible losses. EOUSA and USAO officials in all six of the offices with whom we spoke told us that prosecutors document requests for restitution in their case files and that their offices employ other internal controls, such as the use of templates and forms, throughout the prosecution process to ensure that prosecutors request restitution as appropriate. EOUSA officials told us that although the agency does not track this information, they believed all USAOs generally document requests for restitution in their offices’ case files. Further, USAO officials in all six offices told us that prosecutors document requests for the court to order restitution in their case files by including this information in a written memorandum. To support prosecutors in documenting this information, all six offices we selected provide prosecutors with a prosecution memorandum template. Of the six templates we reviewed, four explicitly include a section for prosecutors to indicate whether victims have been identified and the extent of any victim losses. In addition to these templates, four of six USAOs we selected had forms that prosecutors could use to identify whether cases have victims and their need for restitution when drafting criminal charging documents. Moreover, officials from two of the six USAOs told us their offices use this form as an internal control to ensure prosecutors have identified all victims and considered their need for restitution, if applicable. All six offices we selected also provided prosecutors templates for drafting plea agreements, and templates we reviewed from all six USAOs included language requesting the offender pay restitution, if applicable. However, prosecutors are not required to use plea agreement templates, nor are they required to request restitution as part of a plea agreement. USAO officials from one office stated that including this language in the plea agreement template served to remind prosecutors of their requirement to consider requesting restitution as stated in the U.S. Attorney’s Manual. Select USAO officials also described various forms of management oversight to ensure prosecutors request restitution as appropriate. Specifically, four USAOs we selected require supervisory review of the form that prosecutors fill out when drafting criminal charging documents, which includes information on victims. Additionally, officials in all six USAOs told us that they require supervisory review of plea agreements for every case. For example, officials from two USAOs told us their office requires the Criminal Chief, the supervisor of all criminal cases, to approve documents in the plea agreement, which may include requests for restitution. Federal courts sent information on sentencing decisions to USSC and USSC had information on restitution decisions for 95 percent of all offenders from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. According to our analysis of USSC data, 214,578 federal offenders were sentenced from fiscal years 2014 through 2016 and restitution was ordered for 33,158 of those offenders, or 15 percent. Collectively, courts ordered these offenders to pay $33.9 billion in restitution during this period. Courts did not order restitution for the remaining 181,420 offenders, or 85 percent. Table 1 shows the number of federal offenders sentenced and ordered to pay restitution for fiscal years 2014 through 2016, as well as the total amount of restitution ordered by the courts. The majority of federal offenders were sentenced for immigration or drug- related offenses, and USAO officials in all six offices we selected told us that these types of offenses do not typically have victims with actual losses. For example, from fiscal years 2014 through 2016, USSC data showed that 131,088 offenders, 61 percent of offenders sentenced, were sentenced for immigration or drug-related offenses and courts ordered 999 (or less than 1 percent) of these offenders to pay restitution. USSC data show that courts ordered restitution more often for offenders sentenced for other offenses, such as fraud. For example, courts sentenced 21,551 offenders for fraud offenses from fiscal years 2014 through 2016, and courts ordered restitution for 15,902 of these offenders, or 74 percent. Table 2 shows the number of offenders sentenced and the number ordered to pay restitution by offenses for which restitution was most often and least often ordered by courts from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. The percentage of federal offenders ordered to pay restitution varied across federal court districts; from 2 percent of offenders in one district to 42 percent in another district. USAO officials we interviewed stated that some of this variation may be due to the types of offenses prosecuted within different districts. For example, officials from one USAO stated that their office, which had a high volume of immigration–related offenders, had few cases in which restitution was applicable. Our analysis of USSC data showed that from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2016 and across all districts, districts with a higher than average rate of immigration-related offenders had lower than average rates of restitution ordered. Conversely, districts with above-average rates of offenders convicted of financial offenses such as fraud, embezzlement, money laundering, tax offenses, counterfeiting or bribery had higher than average rates of restitution ordered, as shown in table 3. Judges indicated on documents sent to USSC that restitution was not applicable and thus did not order it for most offenders sentenced from fiscal years 2014 through 2016—167,230 offenders—or 78 percent of all offenders sentenced during this time period. Our analysis of sentencing information for the remaining offenders found that courts ordered restitution at a higher rate as compared to all offenders. Specifically, after excluding offenders for whom restitution was not applicable and were not ordered to pay it, we found that courts ordered restitution for 70 percent of the remaining 47,348 offenders. EOUSA and USAO officials told us that in cases where there are identifiable victims, restitution may not be ordered for other reasons. EOUSA officials told us that restitution may not be ordered for several reasons, such as when victims provide no proof of their losses or when victims recover compensation through other means, such as through civil proceedings. Further, officials from one USAO told us that victims must provide documentation of their losses for restitution and, if victims are not able to provide this documentation, courts may decline to order restitution. Also, in certain cases, courts are not required to order restitution—such as when there is no identifiable victim or, on the other hand, when the number of identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impractical, among other reasons. Additionally, the court might not order, or order only partial restitution for other reasons, such as when the value of property the defendant returned to the victim was deducted from the restitution award or because the victim received compensation from insurance. If a court does not order restitution, or orders partial restitution, it is required to provide the reason for its decision and to provide that reason to USSC, but our analysis showed USSC did not always have these data. Specifically, from fiscal years 2014 through 2016, we found that restitution was not ordered—and no reason was documented in USSC data for that decision—for 9,848 offenders (5 percent of the 214,578 offenders sentenced during this time period). Information on offenders’ sentences, including restitution, assists USSC in its continuous reexamination of its guidelines and policy statements and ensures that various sentencing practices are achieving their stated purposes. Further, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that management should evaluate issues identified through monitoring activities or reported by personnel to determine whether any of the issues rise to the level of an internal control deficiency. In response to our questions about the missing information on reasons why restitution was not ordered, AOUSC and USSC officials stated that they were unaware of the missing information or why it was missing. Judiciary officials stated that because various entities within the judiciary participate in the process of collecting and recording information on reasons restitution was not ordered, they did not know which entities could take action to improve USSC data. However, as previously discussed, if the court does not order restitution, or orders only partial restitution, the judge must provide the reason, and judges usually do so in a written Statement of Reasons form. The Judicial Conference, along with USSC, has developed guidance to help judges fill out the Statement of Reasons form and AOUSC supports the Judicial Conference in carrying out its policies. Further, courts must provide USSC the written Statement of Reasons form for sentences imposed. USSC is also responsible for collecting, analyzing, and distributing information on federal sentences provided by each district court, including information related to orders for restitution. However, judicial officials, including from the entities listed above, agreed that further studying the missing data may inform the judiciary of the cause of the missing data, as well as any efforts needed to improve USSC information. Courts are required to provide reasons for not ordering restitution and to provide this information to USSC so that the agency can analyze and report on sentencing data. Determining why USSC data are incomplete could help inform the judiciary whether the issue rises to the level of an internal control deficiency and whether additional action can be taken to improve the transparency of sentencing decisions. Doing so could help the judiciary ensure reasons for not ordering restitution are provided consistently in all cases and potentially improve data provided to USSC, in turn supporting its mission to promote transparency in sentencing decisions. Our analysis of DOJ data showed that DOJ collected $2.95 billion in restitution debt from fiscal years 2014 through 2016, half of which was collected on debts imposed during this period. The extent of collections across the 94 USAOs ranged from a high of $848 million in one USAO to a low of $1.2 million in another USAO. The median amount collected for USAOs was $10.7 million. DOJ was more successful at collecting restitution on newer debts—debts imposed from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. Of the $2.95 billion in restitution debt collected, about half was collected from new debts imposed by courts during this time period. Specifically, DOJ collected $1.5 billion (4 percent), of the $34 billion ordered from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. The remaining half of the debt collected during this time frame was collected from debts imposed between fiscal year 1988 and fiscal year 2014. New debts—imposed in fiscal years 2014 through 2016—were also more likely to be fully paid during this time period compared to all debts. Specifically, from fiscal years 2014 through 2016, DOJ collected the full amount of restitution on 4,003 of the 24,950 debts imposed during this time, 16 percent. However, across all debts, including debts imposed prior to fiscal year 2014, DOJ collected the full amount of restitution ordered on only 5 percent of debts. Across all restitution debts, DOJ collected at least some of the debt for one-third of debts and did not collect any restitution on the remaining two-thirds. More than 60 percent of the restitution DOJ collected in fiscal years 2014 through 2016 was owed to non-federal victims ($1.8 billion), including individuals, corporations and state and local governments. An additional 37 percent of restitution was collected on behalf of federal agencies that were victims of crimes. One percent of restitution collected was community restitution, which is restitution collected for drug offenses that otherwise have no victims and which is disbursed to state victim assistance agencies and state agencies dedicated to the reduction of substance abuse, as shown in table 4. AOUSC officials noted that some collected restitution is not disbursed to non-federal victims due to a lack of accurate contact information for these victims. Specifically, according to AOUSC, as of June 2017, courts had more than $132 million in restitution due to 113,260 victims that could not be disbursed because of a lack of accurate contact information for these victims. DOJ is required to provide courts with victim contact information, and victims are to notify DOJ if their contact information changes. However, AOUSC and USAO officials told us that this notification by victims may not always occur. For example, officials in one USAO told us that due to the length of court proceedings, victims may move without notifying the court prior to the disbursement of restitution and, as a result, the court is unable to disburse restitution to those victims. According to our analysis of DOJ data, at the end of fiscal year 2016, $110 billion in restitution was outstanding and USAOs had identified $100 billion of that debt as uncollectible, as shown in figure 2. USAOs may identify debts as uncollectible and suspend collection actions on a debt for a variety of reasons, including that the offender has no, or only a nominal, ability to pay the debt. Probation officials, EOUSA officials, and officials from five of six USAOs we interviewed stated that most outstanding restitution debt is identified as uncollectible and collection action is suspended because many offenders have little ability to pay the debt—a conclusion supported by USSC data. For example, according to USSC data, 95 percent of offenders ordered to pay restitution from fiscal years 2014 through 2016 received a waiver from paying a court-ordered fine, indicating their inability to pay. While courts are allowed to take an offender’s economic circumstances into consideration when issuing fines, they generally may not do so when ordering restitution. As a result, EOUSA and federal probation officials with whom we spoke stated that offenders ordered to pay restitution often do not have an ability to do so and therefore a large amount of restitution orders is uncollectible. Through various guidance documents, DOJ has identified and recommended numerous practices for DOJ prosecutors and FLU staff to use throughout the restitution process to help ensure full and timely restitution for victims. USAO officials in all six offices with whom we spoke stated that, based on their experience, these practices were generally effective. Specifically, DOJ and EOUSA officials identified practices for prosecutors and FLU staff to use when requesting restitution, facilitating court orders for restitution, and collecting restitution and documented these practices in several guidance manuals. Officials we interviewed from all six USAOs stated they were generally satisfied with the guidance from EOUSA and that they thought most of DOJ’s recommended practices were effective when requesting restitution, facilitating court orders for restitution, and collecting restitution. Requesting restitution. Officials we interviewed from three USAOs identified coordination between prosecutors and case investigators prior to sentencing to identify victims and their losses as an important practice for requesting restitution. USAO officials from three of the six offices stated that gathering detailed information on an offender’s financial resources, which include assets that could be forfeited and used to pay a restitution debt, was a very effective practice related to requesting restitution. Facilitating court orders of restitution. Although the courts, and not prosecutors, are responsible for ordering restitution, DOJ guidance identifies several practices that prosecutors can use to facilitate orders of restitution that may increase the likelihood of full and timely restitution for victims. Officials from three of six USAOs stated that the most effective practice related to ordering restitution was ensuring courts ordered restitution as due and payable immediately. Specifically, when offenders cannot pay restitution in an immediate lump-sum payment, the courts must specify a payment schedule through which the offender will pay restitution based on the offender’s ability to pay. In these cases, USAO officials stated that it is effective for prosecutors to ensure the restitution order specifies that restitution is due and payable immediately. According to an EOUSA official, this permits the agency to immediately pursue all collection remedies allowed by law whenever the debtor has or subsequently obtains the ability to pay. Collecting restitution. Officials from all six USAOs stated that using the Treasury Offset Program (TOP), a program that allows for the reduction or withholding of a debtor’s federal benefits, such as a tax refund, was one of the most effective practices for collecting restitution. Specifically, officials in one USAO told us that TOP requires minimal effort for FLU staff and can result in a high amount of collections. As an example, officials from two USAOs told us their respective offices each recovered more than $500,000 dollars in restitution debt in fiscal year 2016 through TOP. Officials from three of the six offices also identified using wage garnishment as an effective practice for collecting restitution. Across all parts of the restitution process, USAO officials we spoke with also consistently identified DOJ recommended practices related to internal and external communication and collaboration as effective for improving the restitution process. Specifically, the officials identified collaboration between various units in the USAO as an effective practice to ensuring restitution for victims. For example, USAO officials in two of the six offices highlighted coordination between Victim-Witness coordinators and prosecutors to help identify victims and quantify their losses as effective to assisting in the request for restitution. Additionally, USAO officials in all six offices stated that strong coordination between FLU personnel and criminal prosecutors to identify an offender’s financial resources and available assets was an effective practice to help ensure FLU staff could collect restitution using those resources or assets. USAO officials from five of six offices identified external communication between FLU and the federal probation office as an effective practice. Specifically, officials from these USAOs stated that FLUs coordinating with probation officers during the offender’s supervision period to enforce restitution terms was an effective practice for collecting restitution. Additionally, according to EOUSA guidance, FLU staff can use outreach and training with other partners such as the probation office to facilitate information sharing on restitution collection issues and officials from five of six USAOs told us that FLUs conducting training and outreach is a very effective practice. In addition, probation officials we interviewed in each of the six federal judicial districts we selected stated that ongoing communication between USAO staff and probation officers is effective to ensuring victims are identified and receive full and timely restitution. Probation officials from one court district emphasized the importance of a good working relationship with the USAO, stating that the probation office and USAO are better able to ensure victims and their losses are accurately identified and defendants’ ability to pay is adequately addressed when working collaboratively. A probation official from another office said that probation officers regularly coordinated with the USAO’s FLU, and this coordination was particularly important on cases involving complex financial crimes, where the offender has a complicated financial portfolio. Further, probation officials from five of six probation offices also stated that attending training conducted by the FLU is a very effective practice. EOUSA and selected USAO officials told us that while these practices may be useful in some circumstances, they may not be effective or applicable in all cases or in all districts. Specifically, practices DOJ recommends may be effective when offenders have the ability to pay restitution but are simply unwilling to do so; however, USAO officials in five of six offices stated that these practices cannot mitigate the fact that many offenders lack the ability to pay restitution because they lack assets and income. Additionally, while EOUSA guidance recommends that FLU staff contact co-defendants or victims for information on the whereabouts or assets of offenders who owe restitution, officials from three USAOs told us this was not effective. According to one official, although co- defendants are sometimes eager to share information, the information is usually unreliable. USAO officials also identified some recommended practices as not applicable to their district. For example, EOUSA recommends that FLU units request Asset Investigation assistance from EOUSA for complex cases involving large amounts of valuable assets. However, USAO officials in a small, rural district with whom we spoke stated that the types of cases their office prosecutes tend not to be the type of financial cases that warranted use of this resource. DOJ has identified improving debt collection—including court-ordered restitution—as a major management initiative in its 2014-2018 Strategic Plan. However, it does not have any measures or goals in place to assess its performance in meeting this initiative or meet requirements that it evaluate its performance in seeking and recovering restitution as required by statute. In 2001, we recommended that DOJ adequately measure its criminal debt collection performance against established goals to help improve collections and stem the growth in uncollected criminal debt. DOJ concurred with this recommendation, and as of fiscal year 2003, annually assessed each district based on established collection goals for that district. However, as of September 2017, DOJ no longer evaluates each district based on established goals. EOUSA officials stated that DOJ no longer uses these performance goals and that the agency did not maintain records for when or why it stopped. EOUSA officials stated that while the agency does not have any measures or goals to assess USAOs’ performance in improving debt collection, including the collection of federal restitution, they are working with DOJ’s Justice Management Division to develop a suite of analytical tools to monitor the collection of debt across all offices. According to DOJ, some of these analytical tools have been implemented and additional tools will be implemented by March 2018. EOUSA officials stated that these tools will help the agency determine which cases are most likely to result in significant collections and the types and timing of enforcement actions that generate maximum debt recovery results. EOUSA officials further stated the analytical tools will allow the agency to compare districts’ efforts based on a variety of factors (e.g., caseload, staff size, and enforcement actions). These analytical tools may provide EOUSA with valuable insight into the present condition of the collection of restitution across USAOs, but they will not provide DOJ with a baseline performance standard that could be used to indicate if USAOs’ efforts to collect restitution debts are having a measurable impact in meeting DOJ’s objective of improving debt collection. Additionally, EOUSA conducts evaluations of each USAO every 4 years, which include a review of FLU operations, but EOUSA officials stated that these reviews do not include oversight of the collection of restitution. Among other aspects of USAO operations, these internal evaluations review the extent to which each FLU is complying with statutory and DOJ requirements related to debt collection, has sufficient program resources, and adequately manages its caseload. However, DOJ and EOUSA officials told us that it did not plan to use these internal evaluations to meet the Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016 requirement to evaluate each USAO on its performance in seeking and recovering restitution for victims. Specifically, the officials stated that these internal evaluations are not an appropriate mechanism to meet the law’s requirements because the internal evaluations do not specifically review the seeking and recovery of restitution for victims. According to DOJ officials responsible for the internal evaluation program, these evaluations are largely intended to provide onsite management assistance and analysis of how the USAO allocates its administrative and legal personnel resources rather than the office’s efficacy in collecting restitution. Consistent with requirements outlined in the Government Performance and Results Act Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA), performance measurement is the ongoing monitoring and reporting of program accomplishments—particularly towards pre-established, objective and quantifiable goals—and agencies are to establish performance measures to assess progress towards those goals. While GPRAMA is applicable to the department or agency level, performance measures and goals are important management tools at all levels of an agency, including the program, project, or activity level. Agencies can use performance measurement to make various types of management decisions to improve programs and results, such as developing strategies and allocating resources, including identifying problems and taking corrective action when appropriate. Further, the Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016 requires DOJ to evaluate each USAO in its performance in recovering restitution for victims. DOJ and EOUSA officials told us that DOJ does not require USAOs to establish performance measures or goals to assess their progress in improving the collection of restitution. DOJ and EOUSA officials also told us that each USAO could develop performance goals but that they were unaware of the extent to which USAOs did so, and further, they do not track the extent to which USAOs met performance goals. Additionally, these officials stated that because each USAO faces different constraints in its ability to collect restitution, establishing a uniform and consistent performance measure and goal would be challenging. EOUSA officials noted that some USAOs may have more resources, such as more FLU staff or specialized asset investigators, available to pursue collections as compared to other offices and therefore offices with fewer resources could have difficulty meeting a performance goal. Further, EOUSA and USAO officials stated that the extent to which DOJ can collect on a debt is heavily influenced by factors outside of the agency’s control, such as an offender’s ability to pay. USAOs could use information provided by performance measures and goals—such as an office’s ability to meet a performance goal—to make managerial decisions to help address these constraints, such as by increasing the allocation of staff resources. Further, to avoid comparing USAOs to a nationally set performance goal that does not account for specific constraints faced by each office, DOJ could—as it did in fiscal year 2003—require each USAO to establish its own objective, quantitative collection goals based on historical, district-specific collection statistics. Finally, as previously discussed, each USAO already accounts for external factors that affect the collectability of a debt, such as an offender’s ability to pay, by suspending collection action on debts it identifies as uncollectible. Therefore, any performance measures and goals developed could be based solely on debts that the USAO already has determined to be collectible. Stakeholders we interviewed—including officials from one USAO, probation officials in two districts, and officials with DOJ’s Office of Crime Victims—noted that receiving restitution is both emotionally and financially important to victims. Specifically, officials from one USAO and one probation office noted that while many victims may never receive the full amount of restitution ordered, receiving even a minimal amount of restitution is a symbolic victory and that it is important for victims to know the government is making efforts to collect restitution on their behalf. The legislative history of the MVRA echoes these sentiments, providing that even nominal restitution payments have benefits for the victim of crime, and that orders of restitution are largely worthless without enforcement. Yet, according to our analysis, $10 billion of restitution debt DOJ identified as collectible remained outstanding at the end of fiscal year 2016. Further, the extent to which USAOs collected restitution varied widely— from a high of one USAO district collecting nearly 350 percent of all collectible debt in fiscal years 2014 through 2016 to a low of one district collecting less than one percent of collectible debt in the same period. Without performance measures, including the establishment of goals, DOJ cannot assess if this variation is due to factors outside the control of USAOs or due to management deficiencies that require corrective action. Developing performance measures and goals for each USAO related to the collection of restitution would allow DOJ to assess its progress in achieving its major management initiative in improving debt collection— including debts owed to victims as court-ordered restitution. Doing so would also better position DOJ to meet the requirements of the Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016 to evaluate offices in their performance in recovering restitution on behalf of victims and to use performance information to improve the practices of offices as needed. Although asset forfeiture and restitution are separate parts of a criminal sentence, DOJ guidance states that using forfeited assets to benefit victims is a way that DOJ can help ensure eligible victims of crime are compensated for their losses. Further, DOJ regulations and policy require that eligible victims receive compensation from forfeited assets before certain other uses, such as official use or equitable sharing. However, while DOJ tracks the amount of compensation provided to victims through forfeited assets, it does not have assurances that forfeited assets are being used to compensate victims to the greatest extent possible. According to DOJ information, the agency made payments of about $595 million to eligible victims other than owners of the property from the Assets Forfeiture Fund from fiscal years 2014 through 2016, or 15 percent of $3.9 billion in paid expenditures during this period, as shown in table 5. As table 5 shows, DOJ can account for cases in which forfeited assets were used to compensate eligible victims who were not owners or lienholders. However, DOJ does not have information on the overall universe of victims who could have been eligible to receive compensation from forfeited assets. Further, it does not have insight into any reasons why funds from forfeited assets were not used for these victims. Specifically, DOJ officials stated that the department collects information on whether victims have been identified in cases associated with forfeited assets, and if restitution is anticipated in these cases, but it does not track the extent to which these victims were ultimately compensated using forfeited assets. Further, DOJ also does not collect information on reasons why victims were not compensated using funds from forfeited assets. While DOJ is required to use forfeited assets to compensate victims before using those assets for certain other purposes, the agency is unable to provide assurances that it is always doing so because it does not have information on the overall universe of victims or reasons why victims were not compensated using forfeited assets. As a result, DOJ does not have a basis to know whether the $595 million provided to victims from fiscal years 2014 through 2016 is the maximum amount of compensation the agency could have provided to victims using forfeited assets. Full use of forfeited assets for victim compensation has long been, and continues to be, a goal of DOJ. In 2005, an interagency task force—led by DOJ and including the Department of Treasury, Office of Management and Budget and AOUSC—developed a strategic plan to improve the collection of criminal debt. Among other goals included in its strategic plan, the task force stated a goal of examining how asset seizure and forfeiture procedures can be used to maximize recoveries for victims. More recently, DOJ reported in its 2014-2018 Strategic Plan that it would make every effort to recover full and fair restitution for victims using the federal forfeiture statutes to preserve and recover criminal proceeds. Specifically, DOJ stated that using federal forfeiture statutes to recover full and fair restitution for victims is one part of its strategy to protect the rights of the American people and enforce the rule of law. Finally, DOJ officials told us they considered providing compensation to victims as one goal of the Asset Forfeiture Program and EOUSA stated in guidance that asset forfeiture is the most widely available and effective tool to seize assets for restitution purposes. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government call on federal managers to design control activities to achieve the agency’s objectives. These controls can include using quality information to make informed decisions, evaluate the entity’s performance in achieving key objectives, and address risks. DOJ officials told us that they do not track the extent to which victims were not compensated using forfeited assets because USAO staff are not required to request that these assets be used for victim compensation. DOJ officials explained that staff are required to indicate in the agency’s forfeited asset database, the Consolidated Asset Tracking System, if victims exist in cases associated with forfeited assets and if restitution is anticipated in these cases. However, these officials stated that staff are not required to then compensate these victims using the forfeited assets or to indicate why these assets were not used for this purpose. DOJ officials told us that decisions to compensate victims using forfeited assets are best left to the judgment of the USAO staff familiar with the case, such as the prosecuting attorney or asset forfeiture staff. DOJ officials pointed to informal communication and coordination among prosecutors, the FLU, and the Asset Forfeiture unit in each USAO as a means to provide compensation to victims as appropriate. However, communication and coordination among these groups has been a challenge for USAOs, as the DOJ Inspector General found in a June 2015 review of DOJ’s debt collection program. Similarly, during our current review, EOUSA and USAO officials we spoke with identified communication and coordination as an area for improvement. EOUSA officials told us that while they thought that FLU staff and Asset Forfeiture unit staff were collaborating more frequently to use forfeited assets to collect restitution debts since the issuance of the DOJ Inspector General’s report, the extent of collaboration between these two units still varied across USAOs. Further, officials we talked to in two USAOs and one probation office noted that USAO staff could improve their use of forfeited assets for restitution payments. For example, officials in one probation office noted that it was their practice to identify forfeited assets that could be used for compensation in the PSR because they had observed that USAO staff were frequently not applying such assets to victim compensation. While DOJ may allow USAO staff to use discretion when requesting restoration or alerting victims to assets available for compensation, increasing the agency’s understanding of the extent to which assets could have been—but were not—used for victim compensation, and the reasons for those decisions, does not affect that discretion. There are legitimate reasons why victims might not be compensated using forfeited assets; for example, the assets may have other owners or lienholders that must be compensated prior to victims, or offenders may have other means by which to pay victims restitution. However, there are also instances where victims may have not received compensation through forfeited assets as a result of unintentional circumstances. For example, according to DOJ’s Asset Forfeiture Manual, forfeiture actions can proceed faster than the parallel criminal case. Consequently, assets might be equitably shared, placed into official use, or remitted to victims who file petitions long before restitution is ordered, and therefore would not be available for other victims who wait for restitution to be ordered after an offender is sentenced. To avoid this outcome, DOJ recommends that USAOs coordinate to ensure the retention of property for victim compensation. However, although DOJ officials responsible for leading DOJ’s asset forfeiture efforts highlighted the need for expedient coordination when USAO staff are considering using forfeited assets to compensate victims, they stated this may not always occur. As a result, otherwise eligible victims may not always be compensated through forfeited assets. By gathering information about the extent to which assets were used for victim compensation—including when they were not used and reasons why not—DOJ could have a better understanding of potential instances where victims could be, but are not, receiving compensation through forfeited funds and could take steps to address them accordingly. Options for gathering such information could include doing a one-time retrospective study of forfeited assets with victims or anticipated restitution to determine the extent that assets were used for victim compensation, or creating a tracking mechanism through its forfeited assets database, or another system. Gathering information on the extent to which forfeited assets were used for victim compensation, including when not used and reasons why not, could position DOJ to take action to increase the use of these assets for victim compensation if warranted. These actions could include providing funds for increased asset forfeiture staff in USAOs, providing additional training or changing policies or procedures for using forfeited assets to compensate victims. Fully and systematically understanding the extent to which issues, such as a lack of coordination within USAOs, result in victims not being compensated using forfeited assets would give DOJ a basis upon which to develop improvements to the Asset Forfeiture Program. Such information would also provide DOJ and staff at all USAOs with information to evaluate its performance in achieving one of the goals of the Asset Forfeiture Program and taking action to meet the agency goal of protecting the rights of the American people—including the right to full and fair restitution for victims. Restitution serves the criminal justice goal of holding offenders accountable and, to the extent possible, restoring victims of federal crimes to their prior position had the crime not occurred. Many victims are unlikely to receive any meaningful portion of court-ordered restitution owed to them because of offenders’ inability to pay these debts. However, the fact that restitution is difficult to collect does not negate the important responsibilities of the judiciary and DOJ to properly manage and oversee all aspects of the restitution process. By law, courts are to state why they did not order restitution and provide that information to USSC. While this information was collected and recorded in USSC data for most offenders, we found that this information was missing for thousands of offenders. It is important for the judiciary to ensure that this information is consistently collected and recorded to assist USSC in its continuous re-examination of its guidelines and policy statements and ensure that various sentencing practices are achieving their stated purposes. The judiciary could support USSC in this endeavor by determining why this information is missing. Results from this study could help inform the judiciary whether this issue rises to the level of an internal control deficiency and whether additional action can be taken to improve the transparency of sentencing decisions. While DOJ has delegated collection activities for restitution to USAOs, it could provide better oversight to ensure it is making reasonable efforts to collect restitution and meeting its responsibility to victims. USAOs have identified a significant portion of outstanding restitution debt as uncollectible, but they have also identified $10 billion of outstanding restitution debt that could be collected. Developing and implementing performance measures and goals for each USAO would allow DOJ to gauge USAOs’ success in collecting this restitution and, by extension, the department’s success in achieving its major management initiative to increase the collection of debt. Further, DOJ could use performance information to improve the practices of offices in seeking and recovering restitution, consistent with a requirement in the Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016. Finally, DOJ could gain greater visibility into the use of forfeited assets to compensate victims by gathering information on cases in which victims have been identified and restitution is anticipated but forfeited assets are not used, and any reasons why. Doing so would better position DOJ to take action to increase the use of forfeited assets to compensate eligible victims if warranted and to provide assurance that it is maximizing the use of asset forfeiture in satisfying restitution debts, one of the agency’s most effective mechanisms for satisfying restitution. We are making three recommendations, including one to the judiciary and two to DOJ. Specifically: Judiciary officials, including AOUSC, USSC, and the Judicial Conference, should determine why USSC data on the reasons restitution was not ordered are incomplete. Additionally, if warranted based on this information, judiciary officials should take action to ensure USSC data records include all required information for orders of restitution. (Recommendation 1) To improve oversight of the collection of restitution we recommend that the Attorney General: Develop and implement performance measures and goals for each USAO related to the collection of restitution, and measure progress towards meeting those goals. (Recommendation 2) In cases where forfeited assets were not used to compensate victims, gather information on reasons why forfeited assets were not used for victims. If warranted based on this information, take action to increase the use of forfeited assets to compensate eligible victims. (Recommendation 3) We provided a draft of this report for review and comment to DOJ, the Judicial Conference of the United States, AOUSC, USSC, and the Federal Judicial Center. DOJ concurred with our recommendations and provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. AOUSC provided written comments, which are reproduced in appendix III. In its written comments, AOUSC noted that it would work with the USSC to address our recommendation. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees and the Attorney General, the Judicial Conference of the United States, the Directors of AOUSC, the Staff Director of USSC, the Federal Judicial Center and other interested parties. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.

Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions are listed in appendix IV. According to our analysis of data from the U.S. Sentencing Commission (USSC), 214,578 federal offenders were sentenced from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. Table 6 shows the number of offenders sentenced and the number and percentage of offenders ordered to pay restitution for each primary offense of conviction in fiscal years 2014 through 2016. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has identified and recommended numerous practices for federal prosecutors and Financial Litigation Unit (FLU) staff to use throughout the restitution process through various guidance documents. We conducted semi-structured interviews with officials from six U.S. Attorneys’ Offices (USAO) to obtain their views on the restitution process and the extent to which they believed DOJ- recommended restitution practices related to the restitution process were effective. In particular, we spoke with USAO officials from the District of Connecticut; the Southern District of California; the District of New Jersey; the Southern District of Ohio; the District of South Dakota; and the District of Wyoming. Tables 7 through 9 show the results of our semi-structured interviews. In particular, table 7 shows practices related to requesting restitution and the extent to which USAO officials found these practices effective. Table 8 shows practices related to facilitating orders of restitution and the extent to which USAO officials found these practices effective. Table 9 shows practices related to collecting restitution and the extent to which USAO officials found these practices effective. Each table also indicates practices that officials we interviewed considered as most important or effective for helping ensure victims receive full and timely restitution. In addition to the contact named above, Chris Ferencik (Assistant Director); Kathleen Donovan (Analyst-in-Charge); Enyinnaya David Aja; David Alexander; Lacinda Ayers; Carla Brown; Emily Hutz; Janet Temko- Blinder; and Adam Vogt, made key contributions to this report.\n\n","[""One of the goals of federal criminal restitution is to restore victims of federal crimes to the position they occupied before the crime was committed by providing compensation. Various entities within the federal government are involved in the process of requesting, ordering, and collecting restitution for crime victims, including DOJ and the judiciary. The Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016 includes a provision for GAO to review the federal criminal restitution process for fiscal years 2014 through 2016. This report addresses, among other things: (1) the extent to which information is available on restitution requested by DOJ and ordered by courts; (2) the amount of restitution debt DOJ collected and the amount that remains outstanding; and, (3) the extent to which DOJ has conducted oversight on the collection of restitution. GAO analyzed laws, policies and procedures as well as USSC data on restitution orders and DOJ data on restitution collected from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. GAO also selected a non-generalizable sample of six federal judicial districts based on restitution collections and spoke with USAO officials and federal probation officers. Officials from selected U.S. Attorney's Offices (USAO) stated that they document requests for restitution in case files and employ other internal controls, such as the use of templates and forms, throughout the prosecution process to ensure that prosecutors request restitution as appropriate. GAO's analysis of U.S. Sentencing Commission (USSC) data—an agency within the judiciary—showed that information on restitution orders was available for 95 percent of all offenders sentenced from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. Specifically, 214,578 federal offenders were sentenced during this time period and restitution was ordered for 33,158, or 15 percent, of those offenders. Collectively, courts ordered these offenders to pay $33.9 billion in restitution. Most federal offenders sentenced during these years were sentenced for immigration or drug-related offenses. In interviews, USAO officials stated that these offenses do not typically have victims requiring restitution. GAO found that data on reasons why restitution was not ordered were incomplete for 5 percent of all offenders sentenced from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. Determining why data on restitution orders are incomplete may inform the judiciary of the cause of the incomplete data and any efforts needed to improve USSC data. GAO's analysis of Department of Justice (DOJ) data showed that USAOs collected $2.95 billion in restitution debt in fiscal years 2014 through 2016, see figure below. However, at the end of fiscal year 2016, $110 billion in previously ordered restitution remained outstanding, and USAOs identified $100 billion of that outstanding debt as uncollectible due to offenders' inability to pay. DOJ identified improving debt collection—including restitution—as a major management initiative in its 2014-2018 Strategic Plan. While DOJ is developing analytical tools to monitor the collection of restitution, it has not established performance measures or goals. Performance measures and goals would allow DOJ to gauge USAOs' success in collecting restitution and, by extension, the department's success in achieving a major management initiative. GAO is making three recommendations. GAO is making one to the judiciary to determine why data on restitution orders are incomplete. GAO is making two recommendations to DOJ, including one to implement performance measures and goals for the collection of restitution. The judiciary and DOJ concurred with the recommendations.""]","8541","gov_report","en","None","b80f0f072c417b7475ceaee6fa5c2f708d36a7d31a2570a4","Summary:","gov_report","532","\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the U.S. Sentencing Commission (EOUSA) play aims to enhance the collection of rest of restitution debts.

"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nBeginning the summer 2013 through 2016, there were numerous reports in the media on sexual assault incidents in the U.S. armed services. In many cases, such reports were followed by questions on what actions were taken by the Department of Defense (DOD), the Obama Administration, and Congress to address the issue. This report lists a comprehensive chronology of official activities in response to incidents of military sexual assault, as well as legislative action on the issue. The report is divided into three sections: the DOD and the Obama Administration's actions, congressional action, and legislation in the 113 th (2013-2014) and 114 th (2015-2016) Congresses. Also included is a resources section with related articles, hearings, and reports. Information in this report was compiled from the official government websites of DOD, the Obama White House and Congress.gov for historical background and will not be updated. June 13, 2012 – DOD announced Army Major General Gary S. Patton as the new director of the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO). September 25, 2012 – As part of the DOD's efforts to confront the crime of sexual assault in the military, then Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta announced improvements to prospective commander and senior enlisted training and a review of the initial military training environment in every service. December 21, 2012 – DOD released key findings from the Academic Program Year (APY) 2011-2012 Report on Sexual Harassment and Violence at the United States Military Service Academies. According to this report, the overall prevalence rate of unwanted sexual contact increased in all three military academies. From 2011 to 2012, the Air Force Academy in Colorado showed the largest increase in reported sexual assaults from 33 to 52 incidents. Sexual assaults at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD, increased from 11 to 15, and were up at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, NY, from 10 to 13. January 18, 2013 – DOD announced the release of the 2012 Workplace and Gender Relations Survey of Reserve Component Members . This report included rates of unwanted sexual contact, unwanted gender-related behaviors (i.e., sexual harassment and sexist behavior), and gender discriminatory behaviors and sex discrimination reported by survey respondents during the past 12 months. March 7, 2013 – Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, in a letter responding to Members of Congress, wrote that an internal review was being conducted of a decision by a senior Air Force commander, Lt. Gen. Craig Franklin, to overturn the sexual assault conviction of an Air Force fighter pilot, Lt. Col. James Wilkerson. Colonel Wilkerson was found guilty in November 2012 of aggravated sexual assault and was sentenced to one year in military prison. Lt. General Franklin's decision to overturn the findings of the court-martial freed Colonel Wilkerson, and allowed him to be reinstated in the Air Force. In his letter, Hagel said that while General Franklin's decision could not be overturned, he had asked Pentagon lawyers and the Secretary of the Air Force to review the way in which General Franklin decided the case. He also said he wanted a review of whether the military should change the way it handles sexual assault cases. April 2, 2013 – Secretary Chuck Hagel stated in a message to all DOD personnel on Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month that, ""Together, we must work every day to instill a climate that does not tolerate or ignore sexist behavior, sexual harassment, or sexual assault. These have no place in the United States military and violate everything we stand for and the values we defend."" April 8, 2013 – Secretary Hagel announced that DOD's Office of General Counsel will review Article 60 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) after an Air Force officer's court-martial conviction for sexual assault was dismissed using the authority provided by Article 60. May 6, 2013 – The Office of the Secretary of Defense released a 24-page memorandum from Secretary Hagel to all heads of the military services regarding DOD's 2013 Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Strategy, and the release of the Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military 2012 (2 volumes). According to this report, in FY2012 (October 1, 2011, through September 30, 2012), the number of sexual assaults reported by members of the military rose 6% to 3,374. An anonymous survey of military personnel showed the number of service members who had experienced unwanted sexual contact could be as many as 26,000 but most never reported the incidents. That number is an increase over the 19,000 estimated assaults in 2011. These reports involved offenses ranging from abusive sexual contact to rape. May 7, 2013 – In a DOD press briefing, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Major General Gary Patton, director of SAPRO, announced new series of actions to further DOD's sexual assault and prevention efforts. Hagel directed service chiefs to develop methods to hold all military commanders accountable for establishing command climates of dignity and respect in incorporating sexual assault prevention and victim care principles in their commands. May 7, 2013 – DOD announced the establishment of the Response Systems to Adult Sexual Assault Crimes Panel consisting of nine selected appointees. Secretary of Defense Hagel appointed five members to serve on the response systems panel, who joined four members appointed by the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and the chairman and ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee. May 14, 2013 – The Army announced that an Army Sergeant First Class assigned to III Corps, Fort Hood, TX, was under investigation for pandering, abusive sexual contact, assault, and maltreatment of subordinates. May 15, 2013 – Returning from NATO meetings in Brussels, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Army Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, told reporters that sexual assault in the Armed Forces constitutes a crisis in the military. He further stated that ""We're losing the confidence of the women who serve that we can solve this problem, and that's a crisis."" May 16, 2013 – At the White House, President Obama met with senior military leaders on the issue of sexual assault in the U.S. Armed Forces. The President stated that not only is it ""shameful and disgraceful"" but also ""dangerous to our national security."" May 17, 2013 – During a press briefing, Defense Secretary Hagel and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Army Gen. Martin Dempsey discussed their meeting with President Obama, Vice President Biden, and senior enlisted and officer leadership in the U.S. military. Dempsey told the Armed Forces Press Service that he believes that the long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan may be factors in the growing incidents of sexual assault. He also stated that: ""If a perpetrator shows up at a court-martial with a rack of ribbons and has four deployments and a Purple Heart, there is certainly a risk that we might be a little too forgiving of that particular crime."" May 17, 2013 – In an interview, Air Force Chief of Staff, Gen. Mark Walsh, said that sexual assaults in his branch of the military typically involve alcohol use and can be traced to a lack of respect for women. ""We have a problem with respect for women that leads to many of the situations that result in sexual assault in our Air Force,"" he told reporters in his Pentagon office. Walsh further stated that combatting the crisis is his top priority and that he reviews every reported case of sexual assault. May 22, 2013 – The Pentagon announced that DOD's sexual assault prevention staff would be exempt from furloughs. According to Pentagon spokeswoman, Cynthia O. Smith, ""The full-time civilians working these programs and implementing policies will not be furloughed. This will ensure responsive victim care and ensure all the programs recently directed by Secretary Hagel are implemented swiftly and efficiently."" May 24, 2013 – President Obama addressed graduates of the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD, and noted in his commencement speech that the misconduct of some in the military can endanger U.S. forces and undermine U.S. efforts to achieve security and peace worldwide. He further stated that those who commit sexual assault are not only committing a crime, they also ""threaten the trust and discipline that make our military strong."" May 25, 2013 – In a commencement speech at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, NY, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told graduates that they must be the generation of leaders that will commit to building a culture of respect for every member of the military. He stated that sexual harassment and sexual assault in the military ""are a profound betrayal of sacred oaths and sacred trusts."" He also quoted President Obama's remarks at the Naval Academy when he said, ""these crimes have no place in the greatest military on earth."" May 30, 2013 – Pentagon officials reaffirmed DOD's commitment to fighting sexual assault by launching the Safe HelpRoom at http://SafeHelpline.org , a Sexual Assault Support Service for the DOD community. This new service allows victims to participate in moderated group chat sessions to connect with and support one another in a secure online environment. The Safe HelpRoom is in response to a need for peer support services identified by users of DOD's Safe Helpline for sexual assault victims. June 6, 2013 – In a speech at the 2013 Joint Women's Leadership Symposium, Navy Adm. James A. Winnefeld Jr., vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said plans to combat and eliminate sexual assault include a greater investment in specially trained sexual assault investigators and a push for more psychological, medical, and legal assistance for victims. The vice chairman also said officials will examine the scientific roots of behavioral factors associated with potential predators, which will assist sexual assault prevention efforts. June 7, 2013 – The Pentagon released a statement that Maj. Gen. Michael T. Harrison was suspended of his duties as the Commanding General of United States Army Japan and I Corps for failing in his duties as a commander to report or investigate an allegation of sexual assault. June 7, 2013 – Air Force officials announced Maj. Gen. Margaret H. Woodward has been assigned to direct the Air Force Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office to replace Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski, the former chief of the Air Force Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program. He was arrested and charged by Arlington County, VA, police for allegedly being drunk and groping a woman in a parking lot one mile from the Pentagon. In the previous year, Maj. Gen. Woodward led the investigation of Air Force training in the wake of a sexual assault scandal centered at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. June 27, 2013 – Defense Secretary Hagel met in person with the Sexual Assault Response Systems Review Panel for the first time. According to the Pentagon, ""the panel will conduct an independent review and assessment of the systems used to investigate, prosecute, and adjudicate crimes involving sexual assault and related offenses under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and will develop recommendations to improve the effectiveness of those systems."" DOD established the panel in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2013 ( P.L. 112-239 , Section 576 (a)). Previously, Hagel held a teleconference with panel members. July 3, 2013 – The Chief of the National Guard Bureau, Army Gen. Frank J. Grass, launched a comprehensive campaign designed to assist National Guard units in combating sexual assault as part of a military-wide effort to protect victims and eradicate the crime from the ranks. July 9, 2013 – DOD Inspector General (IG) released its report, Joint Warfighting and Readiness Evaluation of the Military Criminal Investigative Organizations Sexual Assault Investigations . The report evaluated the Military Criminal Investigative Organizations' (MCIOs') sexual assault investigations in 2010 to determine whether they were adequately investigated. The report found most MCIO investigations (89%) met or exceeded the investigative standards and returned only cases with significant deficiencies (11%) to the MCIOs for corrective action. July 18, 2013 – The Air Force adopted two new measures to eliminate sexual assault from within the ranks, including requiring mandatory discharge for airmen, officer or enlisted, who commit sexual assault, and requiring the Air Force's most senior commanders to review actions taken on these cases. In addition, the Air Force Academy is reviewing the results of a survey on sexual assault taken on June 24, 2013. Suggestions from survey respondents ranged from involving faculty with character coaching to a complete revamping of how the Air Force Academy trains its freshmen. July 18, 2013 – Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus announced additional resources for investigators and a new initiative designed to enhance accountability and transparency across the Navy. Mabus approved nearly $10 million to hire more than 50 additional Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) Family and Sexual Violence Program personnel to shorten investigation times, and directed the Navy and Marine Corps to regularly publish online the results of each service's courts- martial. July 18, 2013 – The Air Force announced that airmen who commit sexual assaults will be discharged, and senior commanders must review actions taken on sexual assault cases under new Air Force initiatives as of July 2, 2013. August 15, 2013 – Defense Secretary Hagel announced seven new anti-sexual assault initiatives in a memo detailing ""... absolute and sustained commitment to providing a safe environment in which every service member and DOD civilian is free from the threat of sexual harassment and assault,"" he wrote in a statement. ""Our success depends on a dynamic and responsive approach. We, therefore, must continually assess and strive to improve our prevention and response programs."" October 3, 2013 – Air Force Col. Alan R. Metzler, the deputy director for SAPRO, emphasized that the first step to stopping sexual assault in the military is through prevention but when prevention fails, new measures to improve victims' confidence and combat underreporting were needed. Metzler outlined the DOD Sexual Assault Advocate Certification Program (D-SAACP) and the Defense Sexual Assault Incident Database (DSAID), two initiatives set to improve the advocacy services provided to victims of sexual assault. November 9, 2013 – Army Maj. Gen. Gary S. Patton, director of DOD's SAPRO, reported on DOD's recent prevention and awareness successes before the Response Systems to Adult Sexual Assault Crimes Panel. He testified that new DOD initiatives to combat sexual assault helped create a 46% jump in victims reporting compared to the previous year. December 20, 2013 – President Obama instructed Defense Secretary Hagel and Chairman Dempsey to continue their efforts to make substantial improvements with respect to sexual assault prevention and response, including to the military justice system. He also directed that they report back with a full-scale review of their progress, by December 1, 2014. January 10, 2014 – Army Maj. Gen. Jeffrey J. Snow, the new SAPRO chief announced the release of the Annual Report to Congress on Sexual Harassment and Violence at the Military Service Academies . The report covered the 2012-13 academic year, and found in 2013, reports of sexual assault decreased at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York and the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The number of reported incidents went up at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. January 30, 2014 – The independent Response Systems to Adult Sexual Assault Crimes Panel accepted a subcommittee recommendation that senior military commanders retain authority for referring these crimes to courts-martial. May 1, 2014 – DOD released the 2013 Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military . The report covered the period from Oct. 1, 2012, through Sept. 30, 2013, and revealed 5,061 reports of sexual assault in the Defense Department, a 50 percent jump from the previous year. More than 70 percent of all cases that the military had jurisdiction resulted in criminal charges. July 17, 2014 – DOD collaborated with the Justice Department's Office for Victims of Crime to develop a curriculum that expands on the skills learned in initial sexual assault response coordinator and sexual assault prevention and response victim advocate training. December 4, 2014 – Secretary Hagel released DOD's Report to the President of the United States on Sexual Assault Prevention and Response on its progress in addressing sexual assault in the military, and announced four directives to further strengthen the department's prevention and response program. According to this report, based on survey data, servicemembers experienced fewer sexual assaults in FY2014 than in FY2012, an estimated 19,000, down from 26,000. January 16, 2015 – Secretary Hagel at the Air Force Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Summit remarked that the fight to end sexual assault in the military must be ""personal."" He cited ""encouraging progress"" over the last year, but acknowledged more can be done, notably in areas such as social retaliation, which he said stems from the overall environment. February 11, 2015 – The annual report on sexual harassment and violence at the military service academies estimated that overall rates of unwanted sexual contact at the military service academies declined in Academic Program Year (APY) 2013-2014, decreased for both men and women, indicating that fewer sexual assaults occurred at the academies in APY 13-14 than in APY 11-12. February 19, 2015 – Health and criminal investigation experts spoke at the Army's Sexual Harassment/Assault Response Program Summit on the underreporting of male victims of sexual assault in the military due to factors such as shame and fear of being ostracized. March 26, 2015 – SAPRO head Army Maj. Gen. Jeffrey Snow monitored 50 initiatives put in place by past Defense secretaries Leon Panetta and Chuck Hagel.

"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nSection 420 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act ( P.L. 93-288 , hereinafter the Stafford Act) authorizes the President to ""declare"" a Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG). The current FMAG system was established by regulation in October of 2001. These grants provide federal assistance for fire suppression activities. This authority has been delegated to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) Regional Administrators. Once issued, the FMAG declaration authorizes various forms of federal assistance such as the provision of equipment, personnel, and grants to state, local, and tribal governments for the control, management, and mitigation of any fire on certain public or private forest land or grassland that might become a major disaster. This federal assistance requires a cost-sharing component such that state, local, and tribal governments are responsible for 25% of the expenses. This report discusses the most frequently asked questions received by the Congressional Research Service on FMAGs. It addresses questions regarding how FMAGs are requested, how requests are evaluated using thresholds, and the types of assistance provided under an FMAG declaration. FMAGs can be requested by a state when the governor determines that a fire is burning out of control and threatens to become a major disaster. At that point, a request for assistance can be submitted to FEMA. Typically, requests are submitted to the FEMA Regional Administrator. Requests can be submitted any time—day or night—and can be submitted by telephone to expedite the process. Telephone requests must be followed by written confirmation within 14 days of the phone request. Under the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 (SRIA, Division B of P.L. 113-2 ), tribes are equivalent to states in their ability to request a major disaster declaration, an emergency declaration, or a request for an FMAG declaration. Note that some tribal land holdings are administered by the federal government and, therefore, receive fire suppression support through the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC). The NIFC supports interagency ""wildland"" firefighting efforts on federal lands by the U.S. Forest Service, National Weather Service, National Park Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and FEMA's U.S. Fire Administration. Unlike FMAGs, such support generally does not require tribes to reimburse firefighting costs (FMAGs require the state to pay a 25% cost-share). In addition, tribes with their own fire suppression resources may receive reimbursement from BIA for their costs related to fire suppression on tribal lands. The FMAG request should include cost estimates to support the request as well as information about the fire including the size of the fire(s) in acres or square miles, the population of the community (or communities) threatened, the number of persons evacuated (if applicable), weather conditions, and the degree to which state and local resources are committed to this fire and other fires in federal, state, and/or local jurisdictions. The verbal request must be followed up with a completed ""Request for Fire Management Assistance Declaration"" (FEMA form 078-0-1) and the ""Principal Advisor's Report"" (FEMA form 078-0-2). The following criteria are used to evaluate wildfires and make a determination whether to issue an FMAG: the threat to lives and property including critical facilities, infrastructures, and watershed areas; the availability of state and local fire resources; high fire danger conditions based on nationally accepted indices such as the National Fire Danger Ratings System; and the potential economic impacts of the fire. In addition, FEMA has developed fire cost thresholds that are typically updated on an annual basis. There are two types of fire cost thresholds used to help determine if a state or tribal nation is eligible for fire assistance: (1) individual thresholds for a single fire, and (2) cumulative thresholds for multiple fires. Cumulative thresholds are applied to multiple fires burning simultaneously, or the accumulation of multiple fires in a single fire season. Threshold amounts vary by state (see Table 1 ). Taking Pennsylvania as an example, generally, a single fire would need to meet or exceed $927,274 in damages for Pennsylvania to be eligible for an FMAG declaration. In contrast, the formula for the cumulative fire threshold for a given state is one of two amounts—$500,000 or the amount of that state's individual fire threshold multiplied by three, whichever is greater. Returning to the Pennsylvania example, the sum of three individual fire thresholds equals $2,781,822. Since that amount is larger than $500,000, cumulative fire damages in Pennsylvania must meet or exceed $2,781,822 to be eligible for assistance. In contrast, the individual fire threshold for Alaska is $100,000, but the cumulative threshold is $500,000, not the sum of three individual fire thresholds ($300,000). If FEMA denies the request for assistance, the state has one opportunity to appeal the denial. The appeal must be submitted in writing to the Regional Administrator no later than 30 days from the date of the denial letter. The appeal should contain any additional information that strengthens the original request for assistance. The Regional Administrator will review the appeal, prepare a recommendation, and forward the appeal package to the FEMA Headquarters Office. The FEMA Headquarters Office will notify the state of its determination in writing within 90 days of receipt of the appeal (or receipt of additional requested information). The state may request a time extension to submit the appeal. The request for an extension must be submitted in writing to the Regional Administrator no later than 30 days from the date of the denial letter. The request for an extension must include a justification for the need for an extension. The FEMA Headquarters Office will notify the state in writing whether the extension request is granted or denied. No, an emergency or major disaster can be declared after an FMAG declaration has been issued. However, the emergency or major disaster declaration must be initiated by a separate request for assistance by the state or tribal government. FMAGs are funded through FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), the main account FEMA uses to provide disaster assistance. The DRF is a no-year account—unused funds from the previous fiscal year are carried over to the next fiscal year. Funds in the DRF fall into two categories. The first category is for disaster relief costs associated with major disasters under the Stafford Act. This category reflects the impact of the Budget Control Act ( P.L. 112-25 , BCA), which allows appropriations to cover the costs incurred as a result of major disasters to be paid through an ""allowable adjustment"" to the discretionary spending limits. The second category is colloquially known as ""base funding."" Base funding includes activities not tied to major disasters under the Stafford Act. Base funding is scored as discretionary spending that counts against the discretionary spending limits, whereas FMAGs are funded through the DRF's base funding category. The decision to issue a FMAG declaration is not contingent on the DRF balance. Similarly, FMAGs do not reduce the amount of funding available for major disasters. When the DRF balance was low in the past, FEMA used its ""immediate needs funding"" (INF) policy until supplemental appropriations were passed to replenish the DRF. Under INF, long-term projects (such as mitigation work) are put on hold and only activities deemed urgent are funded. FMAGs would most likely fall into the category of events with an ""urgent"" need. Under the INF policy, FEMA also delays interagency reimbursements, and recovers funds from previous years in order to stretch its available funds. As with many other Stafford Act disaster assistance grant programs (Public Assistance, Hazard Mitigation Grant assistance, Other Needs Assistance) the cost-share for FMAGs is based on a federal share of 75% of eligible expenses. The grantee (the state) and subgrantees (local communities) assume the remaining 25% of eligible costs. Under the FMAG process, FEMA reimburses grantees for eligible activities they have undertaken. The state application for specific grant funds must be submitted within 90 days after the FMAG is granted. That time frame permits the state to gather all information and supporting data on potentially eligible spending to include in their grant application package. The package must also stipulate that the fire cost threshold was met. Following submission of the grant application FEMA has 45 days to approve or deny the application. FMAG assistance is similar in some basic respects to other FEMA assistance. For example, FMAGs will not replicate or displace the work of other federal agencies, nor will FEMA pay straight-time salaries for public safety forces, though it will reimburse overtime expenses for the event. Other eligible expenses can include costs for equipment and supplies (less insurance proceeds); mobilization and demobilization; emergency work (evacuations and sheltering, police barricading and traffic control, arson investigation); prepositioning federal, out-of-state, and international resources for up to 21 days when approved by the FEMA Regional Administrator; personal comfort and safety items for firefighter health and safety; field camps and meals in lieu of per diem; and/or the mitigation, management, and control of declared fires burning on comingled federal land, when such costs are not reimbursable by another federal agency. Until recently, only major disaster declarations made statewide hazard mitigation grants available. Division D of P.L. 115-254 (Disaster Recovery Reform Act, hereinafter DRRA) amended the Stafford Act to make hazard mitigation available for FMAG declarations as well. Under Section 404 of the Stafford Act as amended by DRRA, mitigation grants from the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) are provided to states and tribes on a sliding scale based on the percentage of funds spent for FMAG assistance. For states and federally recognized tribes with a FEMA-approved Standard State or Tribal Mitigation Plan, the formula provides for up to 15% of the first $2 billion of estimated aggregate amounts of disaster assistance, up to 10% for amounts between $2 billion and $10 billion, and 7.5% for amounts between $10 billion and $35.333 billion. FEMA assistance through FMAGs is a direct relationship with the states to assist the state in fighting the fire on state lands. FMAGs are employed so a disaster declaration may not be necessary. The Forest Service and other federal agencies do provide other types of assistance related to wildfire management, such as postfire recovery assistance, or assistance planning and mitigating the potential risk from future wildfires. Most of these programs provide financial and technical assistance to state partners. In addition, other USDA agencies administer various other programs to provide disaster recovery assistance to nonfederal forest landowners, including the Emergency Forest Restoration Program and the Emergency Watershed Program. This depends on the type of assistance being provided by the Forest Service. FMAG assistance is not generally available in conjunction with emergency suppression assistance from the Forest Service, or any other federal agency engaged in suppression operations. FMAGs provide assistance for suppression operations on nonfederal lands, whereas suppression operations on federal lands are the responsibility of the federal agency with jurisdiction. Limited exceptions may occur for declared fires on lands in which the ownership is comingled federal and nonfederal, and the costs incurred by the eligible entity are not entitled to any other type of federal reimbursement. However, FMAGs may be provided in conjunction with other Forest Service assistance programs, such as any technical and financial assistance provided through the agency's state and volunteer fire assistance programs or state and private forestry office. FMAG and other federal assistance may potentially occur in conjunction when there is a cooperative agreement between federal, state, and other governmental or tribal partners to coordinate emergency wildfire protection and response activities. The cooperative agreement often delineates different geographic areas where the state government is responsible for initial suppression operations, regardless of land ownership, and vice versa, where the federal government may be responsible for providing suppression operations in lands under nonfederal ownership. The cooperative agreements (sometimes referred to as ""fire compacts"") specify how costs are to be apportioned among the partners, including provisions allowing for reimbursement, in accordance with applicable federal and state statutes. In the circumstance where a state (or other eligible entity) conducted suppression operations on federal land and the costs were not reimbursable, an FMAG may potentially be applied for and used to cover eligible costs. No, most fires that begin on federal land are the responsibility of the federal agency that owns or manages the land, and are not eligible to receive FMAG assistance. There are some exceptions, however. For example, FMAGs may be available to assist with declared fires that occur in areas with a mix of federal and nonfederal land, if the state has a responsibility for suppression activities under a cooperative agreement with the applicable federal agency, and those costs are not reimbursable under another federal statute.\n\n","['Section 420 of the Robert T.

Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nIHS was established within the Public Health Service in 1955 to provide health services to members of AI/AN tribes, primarily in rural areas on or near reservations. IHS provides these services directly through a network of hospitals, clinics and health stations, while also providing funds to tribally operated facilities. These federally and tribally operated facilities are located primarily in service areas that are rural, isolated, and underserved. In fiscal year 2017, IHS allocated about $1.9 billion for health services provided by federally and tribally operated facilities. Federally operated IHS facilities, which received over 5.2 million outpatient visits and over 15,000 inpatient admissions in 2016, provide mostly primary and emergency care, as well as some ancillary and specialty services in 26 hospitals, 55 health centers, and 21 health stations. According to IHS, federally operated IHS hospitals range in size from 4 to 133 beds and generally are open 24 hours a day for emergency care needs; health centers offer a range of care, including primary care services and some ancillary services, such as pharmacy, laboratory, and X-ray services, and are open for at least 40 hours a week; and health stations offer only primary care services on a regularly scheduled basis and are open fewer than 40 hours a week. The 12 IHS area offices are responsible for distributing funds to the facilities in their areas, monitoring their operation, and providing guidance and technical assistance (see fig. 1). In addition, five human resources regional offices assist the area offices in the recruitment and hiring of providers. IHS federally operated facilities employ both federal civil service personnel and Commissioned Corps officers. IHS may pay higher salaries for certain federal civil service providers through the development and implementation of special pay tables, which specify the ranges of salaries that these certain providers can receive. According to IHS officials, the Commissioned Corps officers follow the same process for applying for positions at IHS as federal civil service employees. However, the Commissioned Corps officers are uniformed health professionals whose pay and allowances are different. IHS also supplements its workforce capacity with both temporary and long-term contracts with individual physicians or a medical staffing company. IHS downloads information on all funded and active positions from the Capital Human Resource Management System, an HHS data system used for personnel and payment transactions that IHS began using in 2016 to track all employee vacancies. According to IHS officials, the accuracy of the data is verified quarterly by regional human resources officers. As the IHS health care workforce also includes Commissioned Corps officers—who have a separate personnel system—the information on Commissioned Corps officers assigned to IHS are entered into the Capital Human Resource Management System manually, according to IHS officials. According to the National Rural Health Association, the challenges of rural health care delivery are different than those in urban areas. These challenges include those related to more complex patient health status and poorer socioeconomic conditions, as well as physician workforce shortages. According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, compared with their urban counterparts, residents of rural counties are older, poorer, more likely to be overweight or obese, and sicker. Those living in rural areas also have greater transportation difficulties reaching health care providers, often traveling great distances to reach a doctor or hospital. Exacerbating these challenges is a relative scarcity of medical providers in rural areas compared to urban areas. For example, the National Center for Health Statistics reported the primary care physician- to-patient ratio in rural areas in 2012 was 39.8 physicians per 100,000 people, compared to 53.3 physicians per 100,000 in urban areas. IHS data demonstrate large percentages of vacancies for providers in the 8 areas in which IHS has substantial direct care responsibilities. As of November 2017, the overall percentage of vacancies for physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, CRNAs, certified nurse midwives, physician assistants, dentists, and pharmacists in these areas was 25 percent, ranging from 13 to 31 percent across the areas. (See fig. 2) However, variation in vacancy rates existed among provider types across IHS areas. For example, while the overall percentage of vacancies for physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, dentists, and physician assistants each exceeded 25 percent, the vacancy rate for pharmacists was less than 25 percent. In addition, for certain provider types in some areas, more than one-third of the positions were vacant. For example, although 29 percent of the total positions for physicians across these 8 areas were vacant, the vacancy rate ranged from 21 percent in the Oklahoma City area to 46 percent in the Bemidji and Billings areas. (See fig. 3.) As another example, although 27 percent of the total positions for nurses across these 8 areas were vacant, the vacancy rate ranged from 10 percent in the Oklahoma City area to 36 percent in the Albuquerque and Bemidji areas. (See fig. 4.) Similarly, across these 8 areas 32 percent of the total positions for nurse practitioners were vacant, ranging from 12 percent in the Oklahoma City area to 47 percent in the Albuquerque area; 27 percent of the total positions for dentists were vacant, ranging from 14 percent in the Phoenix area to 39 percent in the Bemidji area; and 30 percent of the total positions for physician assistants were vacant, and although 4 of the areas had few such positions (the Albuquerque, Bemidji, Oklahoma City, and Portland areas each had 7 or fewer positions), the percentage of vacancies in the 4 areas with 15 or more such positions ranged from 21 percent in the Phoenix area to 40 percent in the Billings area. In contrast, 13 percent of the total positions for pharmacists were vacant, ranging from 3 percent in the Bemidji area to 17 percent in the Albuquerque area. For more information about the vacancies for specific clinical positions, see appendix I. While sizeable vacancies existed across provider types and areas, the majority of positions in all eight areas were occupied by civilians, and about 13 percent were filled by Commissioned Corps officers who are fulfilling assignments with a minimum 2-year term. The percentages of positions by IHS area that were vacant, filled by civilians, and filled by Commissioned Corps officers as of November 2017 are shown in figure 5. IHS officials told us they have experienced considerable challenges in filling vacancies for providers—as well as negative effects on patient care and provider satisfaction when positions are vacant. According to IHS officials, the rural locations and geographic isolation of some IHS facilities create recruitment and retention difficulties. IHS data indicate that 36 of the 102 IHS facilities, including four hospitals, are identified as isolated hardship (ISOHAR) posts. Agency documentation describes ISOHAR posts as ‘‘unusually difficult, which may present moderate to severe physical hardships for individuals assigned to that geographic location,’’ and states that physical hardships may include crime or violence, pollution, isolation, a harsh climate, scarcity of goods on the local market, and other problems. In addition, IHS has reported that insufficient housing, substandard schools, lack of entertainment opportunities, and shopping centers located more than three hours away are all typical not only of ISOHAR posts, but also of many other IHS facility locations. Officials stated that, especially for job candidates and employees with families, these can be critical factors in choosing whether or not to accept or stay in a position. For example, officials from the Portland Area office told us the Colville Service Unit has experienced challenges recruiting physicians because the service unit is 110 miles away from Spokane, and many of the smaller towns nearby have limited amenities—including limited employment opportunities for spouses and school systems that may not meet the expectations of some prospective employees. In addition to hardships generally associated with rural locations, IHS facilities can experience additional challenges specific to recruiting and retaining providers for facilities on tribal lands. For example, Navajo area officials told us that providers who are non-native or are not married to a tribal member generally must go off the reservation to find housing if it is not provided by IHS. According to IHS, the Navajo Nation is one of the largest Indian reservations in the United States, consisting of more than 25,000 contiguous square miles and three satellite communities, and extending into portions of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. Living off the reservation can result in long commutes, contributing to a difficult work- life balance. Furthermore, IHS officials noted, public transportation such as buses or trains do not exist in proximity to most IHS facilities. IHS facility staff told us long-standing vacancies have a direct negative effect on patient access to quality health care, as well as employee morale. Officials from multiple facilities we visited told us they have had to cut certain patient services due to ongoing provider vacancies. For example, officials from the Phoenix Area office told us the Nevada Skies Youth Wellness Center, an adolescent substance abuse treatment center, decreased the number of beds available due to staffing vacancies. Similarly, officials from the Rosebud Hospital stated the facility has diverted obstetrics patients to other facilities since July 2016 due to a shortage of physicians, nurses, and nurse anesthetists. During the diversion, those patients were referred to other hospitals in Valentine, Nebraska, and Winner, South Dakota—about 45 miles away. An official from the Sioux San Hospital said that because of vacancies in the diagnostic testing laboratory, the hospital stopped conducting Chlamydia tests in-house and instead sends specimens out to another laboratory for testing. As a result, the official stated it takes about a week longer to get the test results, which can delay treatment. In addition facility staff we interviewed told us the increased stress and fatigue of providers working to make up for staffing shortages results in decreased employee morale. These staff stated that, in some cases, this stress and fatigue has caused providers to leave IHS. One doctor we spoke with described this dynamic of vacancies begetting additional vacancies as a “never-ending cycle” for the facility. In an effort to recruit and retain permanent employees, IHS has used strategies that are similar to strategies used by VHA and tribal facilities in our review. Specifically, IHS has provided financial incentives, professional development opportunities, and some access to housing. The agency has also taken steps to recruit students and connect with potential applicants through webinars, career fairs, and conferences. IHS offers increased special salary rates for certain health care positions, as well as other financial incentives, such as recruitment and retention bonuses. IHS also offers student loan repayments, in return for health professionals’ commitment to work at IHS for a specified period of time. Special salary rates. IHS offers special higher salary rates for physicians, dentists, nurses, CRNAs, certified nurse midwives, nurse practitioners, optometrists, pharmacists, and physician assistants. IHS officials stated that special salary rates are an important recruitment and retention tool for providers, and that without them, federally operated IHS facilities would be at a competitive disadvantage with the private sector, VHA, and tribally operated facilities. In 2015 IHS reported that recruiting and retaining CRNAs was “an ongoing problem for IHS—mostly due to pay,” and the agency rarely had “a sufficient applicant pool.” IHS reported “CRNA services were integral to IHS operations” and without the ability to recruit and retain these providers, IHS was “at risk of having to curtail services to clients.” As a result, according to IHS officials, the agency developed special salary rates for CRNAs, which became effective on December 31, 2015. As of November 2017, IHS had no CRNA vacancies. However, according to IHS officials, the agency has only developed seven national special pay tables and two local special pay tables for Alaska, as of January 2018, due to a lack of human resources personnel trained in this process. Officials told us only one human resources staff person at IHS is experienced with developing special pay tables, which takes a substantial amount of work. However, they stated that this task is only one of her job responsibilities, and she can complete about one special pay table each year. In comparison, according to an official, VHA has developed and regularly revises over 3,000 special salary rates based on local market conditions. For example, IHS officials stated that Phoenix Indian Medical Center cannot offer salaries that are competitive with VHA because salaries for providers in the Phoenix area are relatively high compared to national salaries, and IHS has not developed local salary rates in the Phoenix market. For example, using pay rates effective January 7, 2018, a nurse just starting a career in the Phoenix area could make $63,871 at VHA (local pay table), versus $44,835 at IHS (national pay table). Although offering increased salaries is an important strategy that IHS uses for recruitment, IHS still experiences challenges in offering competitive salaries. Officials from two area offices told us the maximum amount for a physician salary or certain nursing salaries were not enough for some potential hires, who sought employment elsewhere. While IHS may seek approval from HHS to exceed the maximum salary of certain pay tables, IHS officials said the approval process can be lengthy, which has resulted in the loss of promising candidates—including emergency medicine, general surgery, radiology, and anesthesiologist providers. Similarly, officials from one area office stated that federally operated IHS facilities have experienced challenges competing with other health care systems in recruiting local health care providers, including tribally operated facilities. For example, officials from the Oklahoma City area office told us their area has four of the largest American Indian tribes in the country running their own health systems. According to these officials, in addition to IHS funds, these tribes use money from other sources to pay health care salaries. IHS officials explained that, as a result, tribes can pay higher salaries and may be able to offer other incentives that IHS is unable to provide. Recruitment, relocation, and retention incentives. IHS may offer recruitment, relocation, and retention incentives. Specifically, for positions that are difficult to fill or for individuals who are unlikely to accept the position without an incentive, IHS may offer potential employees a recruitment incentive up to 25 percent of their annual salary. IHS may also pay a relocation incentive for a current employee who must relocate for a position that would otherwise be difficult to fill. In addition, IHS may pay a retention incentive of up to 25 percent of an employee’s current salary if he or she (1) has unusually high or unique qualifications or if there is a special need of the agency, which makes retention essential, or (2) is likely to leave IHS without the retention incentive. Officials from the Phoenix area office told us IHS facilities use the retention bonuses extensively for nursing staff, in particular, to help match the market pay. IHS also analyzed the recruitment and retention of nurses and, as a result of this analysis, requested an exception to the 25 percent limit on recruitment, relocation, and retention incentives, from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). In December, 2017, OPM approved IHS’s request to offer incentives up to 50 percent, and IHS officials told us that they are currently reviewing implementation options. Loan repayment. IHS’s Loan Repayment Program pays provider education loans in exchange for an initial two-year service commitment to practice in health facilities serving AI/AN communities. Recipients agree to serve two years in exchange for up to $20,000 per year in loan repayment funding and up to an additional $5,000 per year to offset tax liability, which IHS pays directly to the Internal Revenue Service. Loan repayment recipients can extend their initial two-year contract on an annual basis until their original approved educational loan debt is paid. In fiscal year 2017, a total of 1,267 providers—about 8 percent of the federal IHS workforce—were receiving IHS loan repayments. This included 434 new two-year contracts, 396 one-year extension contracts, and 437 providers starting the second year of their fiscal year 2016 two-year contract. However, IHS’s Loan Repayment Program is not able to pay for the loans of all providers who request it due to limited funding. According to officials in one area office, this has caused providers to either decline a job offer or leave IHS. According to IHS’s fiscal year 2019 budget justification, in fiscal year 2017, 412 providers employed by IHS who applied for loan repayment, did not receive one. An additional 376 applicants either declined a job offer because they did not receive loan repayment funding or were unable to find a suitable assignment meeting their personal or professional needs. Officials in the Billings Area Office told us several physicians stated during exit interviews that they were leaving because they did not receive the loan repayment funding they hoped to receive. According to area office officials, the Billings area lost 5 physicians in 2 weeks because they were not awarded loan repayments. In addition to its own loan repayment program, IHS has worked with HHS’s Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to increase opportunities for providers to apply for loan repayment through the National Health Service Corps. Specifically, IHS worked with HRSA to increase the number of facilities deemed medically underserved and therefore designated Health Professional Shortage Areas. According to IHS, this resulted in 684 health care delivery sites for placement of National Health Service Corps providers, and the number of placements increased to 443 providers as of August 2016. As of January 2018, according to IHS officials, there were 499 providers serving at 797 eligible sites. Applicants cannot receive loan repayment from more than one program concurrently. Officials from several facilities told us they provide access to professional development opportunities for IHS employees as a retention tool. For example, Northern Navajo Medical Facility (Shiprock) officials said they are sending nurse managers and two to three potential future leaders to the American Organization of Nurse Executive trainings. Officials told us this training allows the nurses to network with private executives and look at fellowships. In addition, Chinle Comprehensive Health Care Facility officials told us they paid for a 2-year residency at University of Texas Health Science Center so one of their dentists could obtain additional training in pediatric dentistry. Officials told us that, in return, the dentist agreed to stay at the Chinle Comprehensive Health Care Facility for 6 years. In addition, Shiprock service unit officials told us they have offered their providers, through a partnership with the University of New Mexico, an online Masters of Science in Public Health program in health management. When housing is limited near IHS facilities, IHS has made some housing available to assist with recruitment and retention of providers. Area officials told us federally operated IHS facilities in the Albuquerque, Great Plains, Phoenix, Billings, and Navajo areas provide some government- subsidized housing for providers and their families. At four of the seven facilities we visited—the Kayenta Health Center, Chinle Comprehensive Health Care Facility, Rosebud Hospital, and Pine Ridge Hospital—we observed some staff housing. Kayenta Health Center. Officials from Kayenta Health Center told us that they provide 158 housing units, from 1 bedroom to 4 bedrooms. In addition, the facility has a 19-unit building, similar to a hotel (fully furnished), for temporary contract providers. Officials said they are considering opening units in this building to permanent employees. Chinle Comprehensive Health Care Facility. Officials from Chinle Comprehensive Health Care Facility told us there are 264, 1 to 4 bedroom housing units available for providers both on its campus and nearby. IHS officials also told us they provide access to 19 parking spaces for camping vehicles. Rosebud Hospital. Officials from Rosebud Hospital stated they provide 150 housing units and are also constructing a 19-unit hotel- style building. They said that most, if not all, candidates from outside of the area ask about housing unit availability when deciding whether to accept a position. Pine Ridge Hospital. Officials from Pine Ridge Hospital told us that IHS also provides 105 housing units for its employees. IHS officials explained the housing is a necessity for on-call providers because staff without on-site housing are required to commute extreme distances in very harsh environments to locate housing outside of reservation boundaries. See figure 6 for examples of government-subsidized provider housing near the Kayenta Health Center, Chinle Comprehensive Health Care Facility, Rosebud Hospital, and Pine Ridge Hospital. See appendix II for information about housing provided by one selected tribe. However, there is a greater demand for housing than IHS can provide. During our site visit, Chinle Health Care Facility officials stated that government-subsidized housing availability to meet employee demand is severely limited at all of their three facilities, and the availability of private housing in the community is “non-existent.” As a result, IHS officials from Chinle told us that some providers commute 60 to 90 minutes to work one-way each day. IHS officials told us that, after conducting a needs assessment in 2016, they determined the unmet need for housing at IHS facilities was 1,100 units. According to these officials, the needs assessment also helped them identify some of the greatest needs for housing. The President’s fiscal year 2017 budget proposal for IHS requested $12 million to build new staff housing units “in isolated and remote locations for healthcare professionals to enhance recruitment and retention.” According to agency officials, based on its needs assessment, HHS provided $24 million to build new staff housing units at the Rosebud and Pine Ridge hospitals in the Great Plains area, at the Crownpoint and Chinle health care facilities in the Navajo areas, and at the Supai clinic in the Phoenix area. IHS has also taken steps to recruit future providers by providing scholarships, externships, internships, and residency rotations to health professional students. Scholarships. IHS’s scholarship program provides financial support to qualified AI/AN candidates in exchange for a minimum 2-year service commitment within an Indian health program. Nearly 7,000 AI/AN students have received scholarship awards since the program started in 1978. The awards include (1) scholarships for candidates enrolled in preparatory or undergraduate prerequisite courses in preparation for entry to a health professions school, (2) pre-graduate scholarships for candidates enrolled in courses leading to a bachelor’s degree, including pre-medicine, pre-dentistry, and pre-podiatry, and (3) health professions scholarships for candidates who are enrolled in an eligible health profession degree program. According to IHS, in fiscal year 2017, there were 805 new scholarship applications submitted. After evaluating the applications, 331 applications were deemed eligible for funding, and the program was able to fund 108 new awards. The IHS Scholarship program also reviewed applications from previously awarded scholars who were continuing their education. In fiscal year 2017, 154 continuation awards were funded. In addition to the scholarship program, according to IHS officials, the agency funds two medical students enrolled at the Uniformed Service University of the Health Sciences each year. Each graduate agrees to a 10-year obligation to IHS after medical school graduation and completion of training. In future years, IHS endeavors to fund two additional medical students at the Uniformed Service University of Health Sciences. Externships and internships. IHS provides scholarship recipients with opportunities to receive clinical experience in IHS facilities. In fiscal year 2017, the agency funded 94 students, who were employed for 30 to 120 workdays per calendar year. In addition, IHS provides externships to students temporarily called to active duty as Commissioned Corps officers through the Commissioned Officer Student Training and Extern Program (COSTEP). IHS officials said that the agency funded about 60-70 students in COSTEP in 2016. IHS also offers a Virtual Internship program through a partnership with the Department of State. Virtual interns spend 10 hours a week from September through May working remotely on their projects, which have included producing bilingual Navajo and English videos for rural health clinics, developing Navajo-specific health education materials on palliative care, improving behavioral health data collection methods, and creating social media strategies and campaigns for health promotion. For the 2017-2018 academic year, about 15 students are participating in virtual internships with IHS. Residency rotations. IHS service units offer rotation opportunities for medical, nursing, optometry, dental, and pharmacy residents as a recruitment tool because research shows students are likely to stay and practice medicine in the area where they studied. For example, the Oklahoma City area has a Memorandum of Agreement with the Oklahoma State College of Medicine, which permits area officials to annually recruit up to two residents from the current year’s residency class to become federal employees while completing their residency program. For every year that IHS sponsors the residents’ position at the university, the resident has a one-year service obligation. In addition, IHS officials from Chinle stated that the service unit participates in educational agreements with numerous universities and residency programs to host medical students, nursing students, and medical residents for rotations. According to officials, recent graduates from residency programs applying for permanent positions with the Chinle Comprehensive Health Care Facility often cite prior rotations at the service unit, or word of mouth from students or residents who have rotated through the service unit, as a reason for applying. The IHS Pharmacy Resident Program is another recruitment program that offers residency training to pharmacists who are willing to serve in high-need locations. Pharmacy residents who are Commissioned Corps officers are required to complete 2 years of service at an IHS federal or tribal facility. Twenty-six Commissioned Corps and civilian pharmacists participate in the Pharmacy Residency Program. See app. II for information on residency programs at tribally operated facilities. IHS officials said they have conducted webinars and career fairs in an attempt to connect with health professional students. For example, in 2016, IHS conducted two informational webinars to recruit Commissioned Corps applicants to facilities in the Great Plains area with critical clinical vacancies. According to IHS officials, approximately 60 applicants attended the two webinars, resulting in 15 nurse hires. In addition, Nashville area officials stated that the area office conducted a marketing campaign at the National Congress of American Indians Conference. Officials explained that the area office provided information about desirable aspects of living in the Nashville area and collected e-mail addresses and areas of interest from potential job candidates. IHS’s Office of Human Resources also partners with HRSA’s Bureau of Health Workforce by participating in nationwide virtual career fairs to promote the National Health Service Corps scholarship and loan repayment opportunities. IHS has also worked with the Office of the Surgeon General to increase the recruitment and retention of Commissioned Corps officers. In May 2017, the Office of the Surgeon General gave IHS priority access to new Commissioned Corps leads—meaning IHS has at least 30 days to make contact with potential applicants to the Commissioned Corps before other agencies have the opportunity to contact them. According to IHS officials, since being given priority access to Commissioned Corps leads, the agency has made 20 direct clinical care selections, of which 15 have entered on duty. In addition to its recruitment and retention strategies, IHS uses strategies to mitigate the negative effects of vacancies by helping to maintain patient access to services, and helping to reduce provider burnout when positions are vacant. Specifically, IHS provides telehealth services; implements alternative staffing models, including hiring nurse practitioners and physician assistants in lieu of physicians; temporarily assigns Commissioned Corps officers to alternate duty stations as needed; and contracts with temporary providers. IHS’s telehealth services include two agency-wide programs that provide teleophthalmology and telebehavioral health services. Teleophthalmology. The IHS Joslin Vision Network (IHS-JVN) Teleophthalmology Program provides annual diabetic eye exams to AI/AN patients in almost all IHS areas with federally operated facilities. According to IHS, patients’ retinal images are scanned locally and sent to a reading center where doctors interpret the images and report back. Officials told us the IHS-JVN program examined 22,000 patients in 2016. Telebehavioral health. The Telebehavioral Health Center of Excellence provides direct care services through video conferencing to patients at remote facilities from providers at IHS facilities that are able to provide the services. These services are provided in all IHS areas with federally operated facilities, and more than 5,800 patient visits occurred in 2016. Additionally, officials told us there are regional telebehavioral health programs, such as in the Oklahoma City area that, combined with the Telebehavioral Health Center of Excellence, saw over 10,000 patients in 2016. IHS officials stated that patients appreciate the telebehavioral services in their communities, because they are the only behavioral health services available in many communities. The IHS psychiatrist who provides services is located in Oklahoma City because, according to IHS officials, it is easier to recruit providers to a more urban location. In addition to these agency-wide telehealth programs, IHS officials identified multiple other local telehealth arrangements that facility staff have developed to help maintain patient access to medical services. For example, there is a diabetes consultant for the Portland area who conducts telenutrition services. There is also a teledermatology program for the Phoenix Area federal facilities operated out of the Phoenix Indian Medical Center. Additionally, several service units—including Pine Ridge Hospital, Rosebud Hospital, and the Sioux San Medical Center—have contracts for emergency department telehealth services. Figure 7 shows telehealth equipment in the Rosebud Hospital emergency department. Staff from multiple facilities told us they have implemented alternative staffing models to focus on hiring for non-physician practitioner positions because these positions are slightly easier to fill. For example, Northern Navajo Medical Center officials told us the facility, facing an emergency department physician shortage, hired physician assistants and nurse practitioners instead. These officials said they converted two physician positions into four physician assistant and nurse practitioner positions. In addition, Chinle officials stated that they added two physician assistants to the urgent care department due to complaints about patient wait times, and patient wait times have decreased as a result. Officials also mentioned dental therapists as an additional type of clinical professional who may be added to the Chinle Health Care Facility staffing model because the service unit has been unable to recruit and retain enough dentists to meet patient need. IHS officials stated that they have worked with the Office the Surgeon General to deploy Commissioned Corps officers, mainly to the Great Plains area, and have also coordinated voluntary temporary duty assignments of Commissioned Corps officers (within IHS and from other agencies) to temporarily fill staffing shortages or meet other mission- critical needs. IHS officials stated that Commissioned Corps officers may also be temporarily assigned to an IHS site to provide services, such as behavioral health support during a suicide cluster. IHS officials from 9 of the 10 geographic areas with federally operated facilities and all seven facilities in our review told us they regularly use temporary contract providers—such as through locum tenens contracts and contracts with university fellowship programs—to maintain patient access to care when positions are vacant. Locum tenens. Officials from the Kayenta Health Center said they contract with temporary providers to compensate for vacancies, and the facility contracts with about 9 providers who rotate to fill 3 vacant emergency department positions. Officials from the Portland area stated that they use temporary providers when there is a staffing shortage with providers. They explained that the Portland area has provider vacancies that have been open for years, and temporary providers fill these vacancies for an extended period of time, usually with a rotating series of providers. Chinle Health Care Facility officials said temporary providers, when of sufficiently high quality, have been recruited to join the permanent corps of civilian service staff. However, they told us locum tenens can cost between $50,000-$200,000 more annually than permanent physicians’ salaries, exclusive of benefits, depending on the specialties and hourly rates associated with the contracts. They said they are finding that increasingly higher hourly rates are needed to ensure a sufficient supply of high-quality temporary providers. IHS officials at all levels of the agency told us they prefer to hire permanent providers, rather than use locum tenens contracts. Facility officials explained that persistent turnover in temporary staff may jeopardize continuity of care. For example, Sioux San Medical Center officials expressed concern about the quality of the care provided by temporary contractors, as well as the consistency of the care provided because the contractors rotate frequently. IHS officials told us that many providers prefer to be on contract due to the higher compensation rates as a contractor, even when taking federal benefits into account. University physicians. IHS officials explained that area offices may also contract with university fellowship programs to provide visiting providers. For example, according to IHS, the Chinle Health Care Facility has entered into long-term contractual agreements with two academic fellowship programs—University of California-San Francisco Health Program and the University of Utah Global Health Fellowship. Officials told us these programs provide U.S. residency- trained, board certified physicians interested in global health to work 6-month assignments alternating with another fellow at an international site. In addition, IHS officials stated that the Navajo area office is collaborating with the University of California-San Francisco and its global health fellowship to assign global health fellows to a Navajo Area site for 6 months out of each year. The officials explained that 24 fellows were placed in Navajo-area facilities in 2017 at costs substantially lower than that of locum tenens contracts. According to IHS, the Great Plains area office has collaborated with the University of Washington’s global health fellowship program to assign global health fellows in Internal Medicine to Pine Ridge Hospital for 11- month placements. Agency-wide information on the extent to which facilities use these temporary providers, and the amount spent on them, is not readily available to IHS leadership. While IHS has agency-wide information on vacancies through the Capital Human Resource Management System, IHS delegates the acquisitions process for temporary provider contracts to the head of each area-level Contracting Office. Therefore, agency-wide information on the number of full-time equivalent employees that are temporary providers working at IHS facilities, as well as the cost of these providers, is not readily available. As discussed, officials we spoke with at IHS facilities told us that temporary providers can cost more depending on the specialties and hourly rates. Without agency-wide information on the extent to which such providers are used, IHS is not fully informed about facilities’ reliance and expenditures on temporary providers or their potential effect on patient care, which is inconsistent with federal internal control standards regarding the availability of relevant information to facilitate management decision making and performance monitoring. Specifically, federal internal controls standards state that agency management should obtain, process, and use quality information to make informed decisions and evaluate the agency’s performance in achieving key objectives and addressing risks. IHS’s lack of agency-wide information on the costs and number of temporary providers used at its facilities impedes its ability to make decisions about how best to target its resources to address gaps in provider staffing and ensure that health services are available and accessible across IHS facilities. Maintaining a stable clinical workforce capable of providing quality and timely care is critical for IHS to ensure that comprehensive health services are available and accessible to American Indian/Alaska Native people. However, despite efforts to recruit and retain providers, IHS continues to face considerable challenges to overcome its long-standing struggle to fill sizeable provider vacancies, including geographic isolation and limited amenities. Although IHS is authorized to offer recruitment and retention incentives, such as loan repayments and subsidized housing, the demand for these incentives has been greater than the agency can meet due to resource constraints. However, more complete information on contract providers could help IHS officials make decisions on where to better target its limited resources to address gaps in provider staffing and ensure that health services are available and accessible to American Indian/Alaska Native people across IHS facilities. We are making the following recommendation to IHS: The Director of IHS should obtain, on an agency-wide basis, information on temporary provider contractors, including their associated cost and number of full-time equivalents, and use this information to inform decisions about resource allocation and provider staffing. (Recommendation 1) We provided a draft of this report to HHS and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for review and comment. We received written comments from HHS that are reprinted in appendix III. HHS concurred with our recommendation. In its comments, HHS stated that IHS plans to update its policies by December 2018 to include a centralized reporting mechanism requirement for all temporary contracts issued for providers. HHS also stated that, upon finalization of the policy, IHS will broadly incorporate and implement the reporting mechanism agency-wide and maintain it on an annual basis. HHS also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. VA provided comments on a draft of this report in an email, stating that VA officials continue to work to improve recruitment and retention of providers at VHA to ensure that they have the correct number of providers with the appropriate skills. We are sending copies of this report to HHS, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and appropriate congressional committees. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on GAO’s website at http://www.gao.gov/. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-7114 or farbj@gao.gov. Contact points for our Office of Congressional Relations and Office of Public Affairs can be found on the last page of this report. Other major contributors to this report are listed in appendix IV. Appendix I: Provider Vacancies with the Indian Health Service (IHS) IHS data collected in November 2017, included the number of positions and vacancies for several types of providers, including physicians, nurses, dentists, pharmacists, nurse practitioners, certified registered nurse anesthetists, certified nurse midwives, and physician assistants. Most of these positions are in the 8 of 12 IHS areas in which IHS has substantial direct care responsibilities. Vacancies for nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, dentists, pharmacists, and physician assistants are provided in this appendix. Nurse practitioners. Nationwide, 97 of 303 positions were vacant in November 2017, and vacancy rates in the 8 areas in which IHS has substantial direct care responsibilities ranged from 12 percent in the Oklahoma City area to 47 percent in the Albuquerque area. (See fig. 8) Certified nurse midwives. Nationwide, 8 of 55 positions were vacant in November 2017. See table 1. Dentists. Nationwide, 81 of 306 positions were vacant in November 2017 and vacancy rates in the 8 areas in which IHS has substantial direct care responsibilities ranged from 14 percent in the Phoenix area to 39 percent in the Bemidji area. (See fig. 9.) Pharmacists. Nationwide, 80 of 637 positions were vacant in November 2017 and vacancy rates in the 8 areas in which IHS has substantial direct care responsibilities ranged from 3 percent in the Bemidji area to 17 percent in the Albuquerque area. (See fig. 10.) Physician assistants. Nationwide, 37 of 125 positions were vacant in November 2017. See table 2. Tribal officials from the Chickasaw Nation and Choctaw Nation described their use of strategies to address vacancies, which were very similar to strategies used by the Indian Health Service (IHS). Like the IHS, one tribe uses the availability of housing units near its medical facility as a recruitment tool for health care providers. Both tribes that described their strategies to recruit and retain providers told us they use their physician residency program in Family Medicine as a recruitment tool. Availability of housing units near the medical facility. Tribal officials from the Choctaw Nation told us the tribe uses housing units—58 housing units that range from studio apartments to multi- room houses—as a recruitment strategy for providers. The provider housing units are occupied by physicians, as well as by physician residents who need housing during their residency or for medical students doing clinical rotations through the facility. According to tribal officials, a factor they considered in making housing units available for providers was the location of its hospital in a rural area of Oklahoma, in a town with a population of about 1,000, which lacks sufficient housing. In September 2017, tribal officials told us all the available housing units were occupied, and the tribe was in the process of constructing at least two 4-bedroom houses. See fig. 11 for photos of a completed multi-room house and one under construction. Offering the housing units to provider staff is also part of the tribe’s overall strategy of offering quality-of-life benefits to attract and retain providers. Implementing Accredited Physician Residency Programs. Tribal officials we interviewed noted that they developed physician training programs—specifically graduate medical education, commonly known as residency training—which they use as an important recruitment tool for physicians. One tribe has implemented its Family Medicine residency program, while the other tribe intends for its Family Medicine residency program to be operational in July 2018. Both residency programs are accredited by the American Osteopathic Association, in addition to the American College of Osteopathic Family Practice for one tribe and the American Council for Graduate Medical Education for the other tribe. One program is accredited for 3 resident physicians per year for a total of 9 physician residents at a time, while the other program is accredited for 4 resident physicians per year. We previously found that physicians may practice in geographic areas similar to those where they complete their residency training. Tribal officials with the implemented Family Medicine residency program told us it is successful in that they hired 7 of the 9 residents who completed the residency program. There is also a retention benefit—current providers have the opportunity to stay up-to-date on the latest medical treatment methods by serving as either mentors or as faculty for the residents. In addition to the contact named above, Kathleen M. King (Director), Ann Tynan (Assistant Director), Kelly DeMots (Assistant Director/Analyst-in- Charge), Sam Amrhein, Kristen Anderson, Muriel Brown, Kaitlin Farquharson, Peter Mann-King, Maria Ralenkotter, Lisa Rogers, and Jennifer Whitworth made key contributions to this report.\n\n","[""IHS is charged with providing health care to AI/AN people who are members or descendants of 573 tribes. According to IHS, AI/AN people born today have a life expectancy that is 5.5 years less than all races in the United States, and they die at higher rates than other Americans from preventable causes. The ability to recruit and retain a stable clinical workforce capable of providing quality and timely care is critical for IHS. GAO was asked to review provider vacancies at IHS. This report examines (1) IHS provider vacancies and challenges filling them; (2) strategies IHS has used to recruit and retain providers; and (3) strategies IHS has used to mitigate the negative effects of provider vacancies. GAO reviewed IHS human resources data for the provider positions that the agency tracks. GAO also reviewed policies, federal internal control standards, and legal authorities related to providers in federally operated IHS facilities. GAO interviewed IHS officials at the headquarters and area level and at selected facilities. GAO selected facilities based on variation in their number of direct care outpatient visits and inpatient hospital beds in 2014. Indian Health Service (IHS) data show sizeable vacancy rates for clinical care providers in the eight IHS geographic areas where the agency provides substantial direct care to American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) people. The overall vacancy rate for providers—physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, certified registered nurse anesthetists, certified nurse midwives, physician assistants, dentists, and pharmacists—was 25 percent, ranging from 13 to 31 percent across the areas. IHS officials told GAO that challenges to filling these vacancies include the rural location of many IHS facilities and insufficient housing for providers. Officials said long-standing vacancies have a negative effect on patient access, quality of care, and employee morale. IHS uses multiple strategies to recruit and retain providers, including offering increased salaries for certain positions, but it still faces challenges matching local market salaries. IHS also offers other financial incentives, and has made some housing available when possible. In addition, IHS uses strategies, such as contracting with temporary providers, to maintain patient access to services and reduce provider burnout. Officials said these temporary providers are more costly than salaried employees and can interrupt patients' continuity of care. However, IHS lacks agency-wide information on the costs and number of temporary providers used at its facilities, which impedes IHS officials' ability to target its resources to address gaps in provider staffing and ensure access to health services across IHS facilities. GAO recommends that IHS obtain, on an agency-wide basis, information on temporary provider contractors, including their associated cost and number of full-time equivalents, and use this information to inform decisions about resource allocation and provider staffing. IHS concurred with GAO's recommendation.""]","6957","gov_report","en","None","0f6c000c1653bd9ad797ec6f7ab49051531cf0181ac1c572","Summary:","gov_report","532","\nThe Indian Health Service (IHS) faces significant challenges in providing health services to members of American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) tribes, primarily in rural areas on or near reservations.

"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nThe Navy currently has 51 attack submarines—comprising 33 Los Angeles class, 3 Seawolf class, and 15 Virginia class submarines (see fig. 1). Attack submarines are homeported at bases in the United States: in New London, Connecticut; Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; Norfolk, Virginia; San Diego, California; and Bangor, Washington; 4 are homeported overseas, in the U.S. territory of Guam. Submarine Safety Controls and Culture On April 10, 1963, the USS Thresher (SSN 593) sank during deep submergence tests off the coast of New England. One hundred and twelve officers and enlisted sailors and 17 civilians perished in the tragedy. The accident investigation concluded that the Navy did not have adequate procedures in place to prevent and respond to a catastrophic flooding incident. time, and that maintenance delays reduce the amount of time during which ships and submarines are available for training and operations. Submarine fleet and squadron officials emphasized the strict safety culture that permeates the submarine community. This emphasis on meeting safety certification criteria means that the Navy operates a supply-based submarine force that does not compromise on adherence to training and maintenance standards to meet combatant commander demands, according to these officials (see sidebar). Officials added that the Navy will delay deployment dates if necessary to ensure that these standards are met. As a result, deployed readiness is high and attack submarines are in excellent materiel condition as compared with the rest of the Navy fleet. The loss of the USS Thresher and its crew spurred the Navy to establish stringent safety requirements for submarines to prevent another loss at sea. Following the accident, the Navy established submarine safety certification criteria to provide maximum reasonable assurance that critical systems would protect the crew from flooding and allow the submarine to conduct an emergency surfacing should flooding occur. This program, known as SUBSAFE, is still in use today, to ensure that these critical systems receive a high quality of work and that all work is properly documented. According to the Navy, the SUBSAFE certification status of a submarine is fundamental to its mission capability, as it provides a thorough and systematic approach to quality, and to a culture that permeates the entire submarine community. According to Navy officials, since the SUBSAFE program was established in 1963, no SUBSAFE-certified submarine has ever been lost. The Navy has been unable to begin or complete the vast majority of its attack submarine maintenance periods on time resulting in significant maintenance delays and operating and support cost expenditures. Our analysis of Navy maintenance data shows that between fiscal year 2008 and the end of fiscal year 2018, attack submarines will have incurred 10,363 days of idle time and maintenance delays as a result of delays in getting into and out of the shipyards. Our analysis found that the primary driver affecting attack submarines are delays in completing depot maintenance. For example, of the 10,363 total days of lost time since fiscal year 2008, 8,472 (82 percent) were due to depot maintenance delays. As we previously reported, completing ship and submarine maintenance on time is essential to Navy readiness, as maintenance periods lasting longer than planned could reduce the number of days during which ships and crews are available for training or operations. Attack submarines also face delays in beginning maintenance when the public shipyards have no available capacity, in some cases forcing submarines to idle pierside because they are no longer certified to conduct normal operations. According to Navy officials, the SUBSAFE program—its program to ensure and certify submarine safety—requires submarines to adhere to strict maintenance schedules and pass materiel condition assessments before they are allowed to submerge. Attack submarines that go too long without receiving required maintenance are at risk of having their materiel certification expire. Should this certification expire, these submarines are restricted to sitting idle, pierside, while they wait until a shipyard has the capacity to begin their maintenance period (see fig. 2). We found that since fiscal year 2008, 14 attack submarines have spent a combined 61 months (1,891 days) idling while waiting to enter shipyards for maintenance. Idle time incurred while waiting to begin a maintenance period is often coupled with maintenance delays while at the shipyards, thus compounding total delays. We also found that the Navy incurs significant costs in operating and supporting submarines that are experiencing maintenance delays and idle time. We analyzed the operating and support costs the Navy incurs on average to estimate the costs of crewing, maintaining, and supporting attack submarines that are delayed in getting into and out of the shipyards. Using historical daily cost data the Navy adjusted for inflation, we estimated that since fiscal year 2008 the Navy has spent more than $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2018 constant dollars on attack submarines sitting idle while waiting to enter the shipyards, and on those delayed in completing their maintenance at the shipyards (see table 1). While the Navy would incur these costs regardless of whether the submarine was delayed, idled, or deployed, our estimate of $1.5 billion represents costs incurred from fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2018 for attack submarines without receiving any operational capability in return. While acknowledging the magnitude of these costs, Navy officials stated that there may be some benefits that could be realized from these operating and support costs since crews on idle attack submarines can conduct some limited training. Operating and support costs include payment of crew salaries, purchasing of spare parts, and conducting of maintenance, among other things, but they do not represent the full operational impact incurred by the Navy from the idle time and maintenance delays. For example, attack submarine depot-level maintenance requires the use of a drydock, and officials from the three public shipyards we visited told us that their drydock capacity was limited. A delayed attack submarine maintenance period can restrict the use of a drydock for much longer than originally anticipated, thereby preventing the shipyard from using that drydock to maintain other vessels, including other types of ships, or to conduct necessary repairs on the facilities. The Navy has started to address workforce shortages and facilities needs at the public shipyards. These efforts to address the Navy’s maintenance challenges are important steps, but they will require several years of sustained management attention to reach fruition. As we reported in September 2017, maintenance on ships and submarines may be delayed for numerous reasons, including workforce gaps and inexperience, the poor condition of facilities and equipment, parts shortages, changes in planned maintenance work, and weather. According to Navy officials, all of these issues continue to affect the Navy’s ability to complete attack submarine maintenance on time. According to officials, the Navy has begun to address some of these challenges. For example: The public shipyards have been hiring to address workforce shortages. The number of civilian full-time employees at the shipyards increased from 25,087 in 2007 to 34,160 in 2017, with a goal to reach 36,100 by 2020. Navy officials cautioned that this newly hired workforce is largely inexperienced and will require time to attain full proficiency. The Navy has released a plan to guide public shipyard capital investments. In September 2017 we reported that the Navy projected an inability to support 50 planned submarine maintenance periods over the ensuing 23 years, due to capacity and capability shortfalls at the public shipyards. We recommended that the Navy develop a comprehensive plan for shipyard capital investment. In February 2018 the Navy published its shipyard optimization plan, outlining an estimated $21 billion investment needed to address shipyard facility and equipment needs over 20 years to meet the operational needs of the current Navy fleet, but not the larger fleet size planned for the future. While the public shipyards have operated above capacity for the past several years, attack submarine maintenance delays are getting longer and idle time is increasing. The Navy expects the maintenance backlogs at the public shipyards to continue. We estimate that, as a result of these backlogs, the Navy will incur approximately $266 million in operating and support costs in fiscal year 2018 constant dollars for idle submarines from fiscal year 2018 through fiscal year 2023, as well as additional depot maintenance delays. The Navy may have options to mitigate idle time and maintenance delays. For example, officials at the private shipyards—General Dynamics Electric Boat and Huntington Ingalls Industries-Newport News Shipbuilding—told us that they will have available capacity for repair work for at least the next 5 years. Although the Navy has shifted about 8 million man-hours in attack submarine maintenance to private shipyards over the past 5 years, it has done so sporadically, having decided to do so in some cases only after experiencing lengthy periods of idle time. According to private shipyard officials, the sporadic shifts in workload have resulted in repair workload gaps that have disrupted private shipyard workforce, performance, and capital investment—creating costs that are ultimately borne in part by the Navy. We believe that the Navy has not fully mitigated this challenge because it has not completed a comprehensive business case analysis to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards, and to proactively minimize attack submarine idle time and maintenance delays. Such an analysis would help the Navy better assess private shipyard capacity to perform attack submarine maintenance and would help it incorporate a complete accounting of all costs, benefits, and risks, including: the large operating and support costs of having attack submarines sitting idle; the qualitative benefits associated with providing additional availability to the combatant commanders; and the potential for additional work at private shipyards to reduce schedule risk to submarine construction programs by allowing the yards to build and maintain a stable shipyard workforce. The April 2011 DOD Product Support Business Case Analysis Guidebook provides standards for DOD’s process for conducting analyses of costs, benefits, and risks. It states that data sources used to conduct a business case analysis should be comprehensive and should include both quantitative and qualitative values. It notes that benefits, such as the availability of a weapon system, may be qualitative in nature, and that DOD should evaluate all possible support options, to include government- and contractor-provided maintenance. Navy leadership has acknowledged that they need to be more proactive in leveraging private shipyard repair capacity, but officials cautioned that maintenance could cost more at a private shipyard than at a public shipyard. However, without a complete accounting of all costs, benefits, and risks, the Navy will remain unable to determine whether the cost of performing a maintenance period at a private shipyard would outweigh the mission benefits of having reduced idle time, additional operational availability, and the potential for reduced risk to submarine construction programs. The nation’s investment in attack submarines provides the United States an asymmetric advantage to gather intelligence undetected, attack enemy targets, and insert special forces, among other capabilities. However, the Navy’s attack submarine fleet has suffered from persistent and costly maintenance delays. Although the Navy has several activities underway to reduce maintenance delays for the attack submarine fleet, it has not yet taken additional steps to maximize attack submarine readiness that fully address challenges such as the allocation of maintenance periods between public and private shipyards. Without addressing this challenge, the Navy will not achieve the full benefit of the nation’s investment in its attack submarines, and it risks continued expenditure of operating and support funding to crew, maintain, and support attack submarines that provide no operational capability because they are delayed in getting into and out of maintenance. The Secretary of the Navy should ensure that the Chief of Naval Operations conducts a business case analysis to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards; this analysis should include an assessment of private shipyard capacity to perform attack submarine maintenance, and should incorporate a complete accounting of both (a) the costs and risks associated with attack submarines sitting idle, and (b) the qualitative benefits associated with having the potential to both mitigate risk in new submarine construction and provide additional availability to the combatant commanders. We provided a draft of the classified version of the report to DOD for review and comment. That draft contained the same recommendation as this unclassified version as well as three additional recommendations DOD deemed sensitive. In written comments provided by DOD (reprinted in appendix II), DOD concurred with our recommendation stating that it has taken the first steps to take a more holistic view of submarine maintenance requirements and impacts across both the public and private shipyards. The Navy also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to congressional committees; the Secretary of Defense; the Secretary of the Navy, and other interested parties.

If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-3489 or pendletonj@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix IV. To assess the extent to which the Navy has experienced maintenance delays in its attack submarine fleet, we analyzed attack submarine maintenance delay and idle time data from Naval Sea Systems Command, and we reviewed prior GAO work on shipyard maintenance delays. The Navy determines depot maintenance delays by counting each day in which a submarine maintenance period extends beyond the planned completion date. Two Navy offices within Naval Sea Systems Command—that is, the Logistics, Maintenance, and Industrial Operations office and Program Executive Office Submarines—track days incurred from depot-level maintenance delays and idle time. To determine the total number of days of maintenance delays for each fiscal year within our scope, we subtracted the planned completion date from the actual completion date to produce the number of days of maintenance delays for each maintenance period for each submarine. We added together the days of maintenance delays across all attack submarines for each fiscal year, and then added the fiscal year totals to produce the overall total. Although the data included some maintenance periods that began before fiscal year 2008, we counted days of maintenance delays only from periods that were incurred in fiscal years 2008 through 2018. We also tracked the total number of days that the Navy completed maintenance periods ahead of schedule—that is, 153—but we noted these separately instead of subtracting them from the total number of days of maintenance delays. To estimate costs associated with these delays, we analyzed annual data from fiscal years 2011 through 2017 (the most current data available at the time of our review) from the Navy’s Visibility and Management of Operating and Support Costs system. We also reviewed prior work on determining the operating and support costs of Navy ships. The Navy calculates total operating and support expenditures for each attack submarine on an annual basis, as well as the yearly average expenditure for each attack submarine class, including Los Angeles class, Seawolf class, and Virginia class blocks one and two. For each class, we converted the Navy’s annual class averages into daily average costs by adding the annual class averages together for each year that data were available, fiscal years 2011 through 2017, then dividing that number by the total number of days. We then multiplied the daily class average by the total number of days of maintenance delays and idle time incurred by submarines within that class, according to our calculations outlined above, between fiscal year 2008 and fiscal year 2018, and we added these totals together to produce the total estimated operating and support cost for days of maintenance delays and idle time incurred during this period. The data did not include annual class average costs for fiscal years 2008, 2009, 2010, or 2018. However, the annual class averages for fiscal years 2011 through 2017 did not show significant variation, so we applied these averages to 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2018. To assess the extent to which the Navy has addressed any challenges and developed mitigation plans for any maintenance delays, we reviewed the Navy’s plans to address attack submarine maintenance delays and interviewed Navy headquarters, fleet, and squadron officials, attack submarine crews, and public and private shipyard officials to understand any plans to address attack submarine maintenance delays and idle time. We analyzed data on factors contributing to attack submarine maintenance delays, such as cannibalization rates. We visited three of the four public shipyards, including Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, and Norfolk Naval Shipyard, to observe operations, training, and the condition of the facilities and equipment, and to interview officials about challenges affecting operational efficiency and performance. We also met with Navy maintainers at Naval Station Norfolk and Naval Submarine Base New London, and with the crew of the submarine tenders USS Frank Cable (AS-40) and USS Emory S. Land (AS-39) in Guam. We toured the two private shipyards that conduct attack submarine repair work—General Dynamics Electric Boat and Huntington Ingalls Industries-Newport News Shipbuilding—and interviewed executives at both locations. We also toured attack submarines and met with crew leadership, selected according to which submarines and crews were available for tours at each of the sites we visited. We visited the USS Boise (SSN 764) at Naval Station Norfolk and four attack submarines in depot-level maintenance: the USS Albany (SSN 753), the USS Jefferson City (SSN 759), the USS New Mexico (SSN 779), and the USS Springfield (SSN 761). We met with the crews of two attack submarines assigned to the operating forces at the time of our visit, the USS Missouri (SSN 780) and the USS North Dakota (SSN 784). We evaluated the Navy’s plans to address any challenges against criteria in federal standards for internal control, which state that agencies should evaluate performance in achieving key objectives and addressing risks; the Department of Defense’s business case analysis guidebook, which provides standards for the process used to conduct analyses of costs, benefits, and risks; the Project Management Book of Knowledge, which provides best practices for project management; and the Secretary of the Navy’s December 2017 Strategic Readiness Review, which calls for the early identification of systemic risks before problems occur. To assess the reliability of the data sources for conducting analyses to address all of the objectives in this report, we reviewed systems documentation and interviewed officials to understand system operating procedures, organizational roles and responsibilities, and error-checking mechanisms. We selected the time frames for each of the data series above after assessing their availability and reliability, to maximize the amount of data available for us to make meaningful comparisons. We assessed the reliability of each of the data sources. The Navy provided information based on our questions regarding data reliability, including information on an overview of the data, data-collection processes and procedures, data quality controls, and overall perceptions of data quality. The Navy provided documentation of how the systems are structured and what written procedures are in place to help ensure that the appropriate information is collected and properly categorized. Additionally, we interviewed Navy officials to obtain further clarification on data reliability, discuss how the data were collected and reported, and explain how we planned to use the data. We also conducted our own error checks to look for inaccurate or questionable data, and we discussed with officials any data irregularities we found. We conducted these assessments on the following data for attack submarines: Navy deployed and surge-ready submarines from fiscal years 2011 through 2018; maintenance timeliness from fiscal years 2000 through 2018; idle time from fiscal years 2008 through 2018; operating and support costs from fiscal years 2011 through 2017; and cannibalization rates from 2012 through 2017. Some of these data were used in prior reports, and their reliability had previously been assessed. After further assessing any data that we had not recently used, we determined that they were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of summarizing attack submarine readiness trends and related information. We interviewed officials, and where appropriate obtained documentation, at the following locations: Office of the Chief of Naval Operations Undersea Warfare Division (N97) Warfare Integration Division (N83) U.S. Fleet Forces Command Commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet Commander, Submarine Squadron 4 Commander, Regional Support Group Groton Commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander, Submarine Squadron 1 Commander, Submarine Squadron 7 Commander, Submarine Squadron 15 Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) Logistics, Maintenance, and Industrial Operations (NAVSEA 04) Program Executive Office, Submarines Attack Submarine Program Office (PMS 392) Submarine Maintenance Engineering, Planning, and Procurement (SUBMEPP) Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Conversion, and Repair (SUPSHIP) Newport News, Virginia Navy Education and Training Command Submarine Learning Facility Norfolk Navy Board of Inspection and Survey Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Norfolk, Virginia Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Kittery, Maine Newport News Shipbuilding, Virginia, operated by Huntington Ingalls Industries Electric Boat, Groton, Connecticut, operated by General Dynamics The performance audit upon which this report is based was conducted from August 2017 to October 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

These capabilities make attack submarines some of the most–requested assets by the global combatant commanders. GAO was asked to review the readiness of the Navy's attack submarine force. This report discusses the extent to which the Navy (1) has experienced maintenance delays in its attack submarine fleet and costs associated with any delays; and (2) has addressed any challenges and developed mitigation plans for any maintenance delays. GAO analyzed readiness information from fiscal years 2008-2018, operating and support costs, maintenance performance, and other data; visited attack submarines and squadrons; and interviewed public and private shipyard and fleet officials. This is a public version of a classified report issued in October 2018. Information the Department of Defense deemed classified or sensitive, such as attack submarine force structure requirements and detailed data on attack submarine maintenance delays, has been omitted. The Navy has been unable to begin or complete the vast majority of its attack submarine maintenance periods on time resulting in significant maintenance delays and operating and support cost expenditures. GAO's analysis of Navy maintenance data shows that between fiscal year 2008 and 2018, attack submarines have incurred 10,363 days of idle time and maintenance delays as a result of delays in getting into and out of the shipyards. For example, the Navy originally scheduled the USS Boise to enter a shipyard for an extended maintenance period in 2013 but, due to heavy shipyard workload, the Navy delayed the start of the maintenance period. In June 2016, the USS Boise could no longer conduct normal operations and the boat has remained idle, pierside for over two years since then waiting to enter a shipyard (see figure). GAO estimated that since fiscal year 2008 the Navy has spent more than $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2018 constant dollars to support attack submarines that provide no operational capability—those sitting idle while waiting to enter the shipyards, and those delayed in completing their maintenance at the shipyards. The Navy has started to address challenges related to workforce shortages and facilities needs at the public shipyards. However, it has not effectively allocated maintenance periods among public shipyards and private shipyards that may also be available to help minimize attack submarine idle time. GAO's analysis found that while the public shipyards have operated above capacity for the past several years, attack submarine maintenance delays are getting longer and idle time is increasing. The Navy may have options to mitigate this idle time and maintenance delays by leveraging private shipyard capacity for repair work. But the Navy has not completed a comprehensive business case analysis as recommended by Department of Defense guidelines to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards. Navy leadership has acknowledged that they need to be more proactive in leveraging potential private shipyard repair capacity. Without addressing this challenge, the Navy risks continued expenditure of operating and support funding to crew, maintain, and support attack submarines that provide no operational capability because they are delayed in getting into and out of maintenance. GAO recommends that the Navy conduct a business case analysis to inform maintenance workload allocation across public and private shipyards. The Department of Defense concurred with GAO's recommendation.""]","3817","gov_report","en","None","63bfe4332c2b9854797561b506336d4a5f5b878b005b6b0b","Summary:","gov_report","532","\nThe U.S. Navy currently has 51 attack submarines, comprising 33 Los Angeles class, 3 Seawolf class, and 15 Virginia class submarines.

"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nThis report provides background information and issues for Congress on the Aegis ballistic missile defense (BMD) program, which is carried out by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and the Navy, and gives Navy Aegis cruisers and destroyers a capability for conducting BMD operations. The issue for Congress is whether to approve, reject, or modify Department of Defense (DOD) acquisition strategies and proposed funding levels for the Aegis BMD program. Congress's decisions on the Aegis BMD program could significantly affect U.S. BMD capabilities and funding requirements, and the BMD-related industrial base. For an overview of the strategic and budgetary context in which the Aegis BMD program may be considered, see CRS Report RL32665, Navy Force Structure and Shipbuilding Plans: Background and Issues for Congress , by Ronald O'Rourke. Most of the Navy's cruisers and destroyers are called Aegis ships because they are equipped with the Aegis ship combat system—an integrated collection of sensors, computers, software, displays, weapon launchers, and weapons named for the mythological shield that defended Zeus. The Aegis system was originally developed in the 1970s for defending ships against aircraft, anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs), surface threats, and subsurface threats. The system was first deployed by the Navy in 1983, and it has been updated many times since. The Navy's Aegis ships include Ticonderoga (CG-47) class cruisers and Arleigh Burke (DDG-51) class destroyers. A total of 27 CG-47s (CGs 47 through 73) were procured for the Navy between FY1978 and FY1988; the ships entered service between 1983 and 1994. The first five ships in the class (CGs 47 through 51), which were built to an earlier technical standard in certain respects, were judged by the Navy to be too expensive to modernize and were removed from service in 2004-2005, leaving 22 ships in operation (CGs 52 through 73). A total of 62 DDG-51s were procured for the Navy between FY1985 and FY2005; the first entered service in 1991 and the 62 nd entered service in FY2012. The first 28 ships are known as Flight I/II DDG-51s. The next 34 ships, known as Flight IIA DDG-51s, incorporate some design changes, including the addition of a helicopter hangar. No DDG-51s were procured in FY2006-FY2009. The Navy during this period instead procured three Zumwalt (DDG-1000) class destroyers. The DDG-1000 design does not use the Aegis system and does not include a capability for conducting BMD operations. Navy plans do not call for modifying the three DDG-1000s to make them BMD-capable. Procurement of DDG-51s resumed in FY2010, following procurement of the three DDG-1000s. A total of 20 DDG-51s were procured in FY2010-FY2019. DDG-51s procured in FY2017 and subsequent years are being built to a new version of the DDG-51 design called the Flight III version. The Flight III version is to be equipped with a new radar, called the Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) or the SPY-6 radar, that is more capable than the SPY-1 radar installed on all previous Aegis cruisers and destroyers. Sales of the Aegis system to allied countries began in the late 1980s. Allied countries that now operate, are building, or are planning to build Aegis-equipped ships include Japan, South Korea, Australia, Spain, and Norway. Most of Japan's Aegis-equipped ships are currently BMD-capable, and Japan plans to make all of them BMD-capable in coming years. The Aegis-equipped ships operated by South Korea, Australia, Spain, and Norway are not BMD-capable. Aegis ships are given a capability for conducting BMD operations by incorporating changes to the Aegis system's computers and software, and by arming the ships with BMD interceptor missiles. In-service Aegis ships can be modified to become BMD-capable ships, and DDG-51s procured in FY2010 and subsequent years are being built from the start with a BMD capability. The Aegis BMD system exists in several variants. Listed in order of increasing capability, these include (but are not necessarily limited to) 3.6.X variant, the 4.0.3 variant, the 4.1 variant (also known as the Aegis Baseline [BL] 5.4 variant), the 5.0 CU (Capability Upgrade) variant (also known as the BL 9.1 variant), the 5.1 variant (also known as the BL 9.2 variant), and the 6.X variant (also known as the BL 10 variant). Figure 1 summarizes the capabilities of some of these variants (using their designations as of 2016) and correlates them with the phases of the European Phased Adaptive Approach (or EPAA; see discussion below) for European BMD operations. As shown in Figure 1 , the Aegis BMD system was originally designed primarily to intercept theater-range ballistic missiles, meaning short-, medium-, and intermediate-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs, MRBMs, and IRBMs, respectively). In addition to its capability for intercepting theater-range ballistic missiles, detection and tracking data collected by the Aegis BMD system's radar might be passed to other U.S. BMD systems that are designed to intercept intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), which might support intercepts of ICBMs that are conducted by those other U.S. BMD systems. With the advent of the Aegis BMD system's new SM-3 Block IIA interceptor (which is discussed further in the next section), DOD is now evaluating the potential for the Aegis BMD system to intercept certain ICBMs. Section 1680 of the FY2018 National Defense Authorization Act ( H.R. 2810 / P.L. 115-91 of December 12, 2017) directed DOD to ""conduct a test to evaluate and demonstrate, if technologically feasible, the capability to defeat a simple intercontinental ballistic missile threat using the standard missile 3 block IIA missile interceptor."" DOD's January 2019 missile defense review report states the following: The SM-3 Blk IIA interceptor is intended as part of the regional missile defense architecture, but also has the potential to provide an important ""underlay"" to existing GBIs [ground-based interceptors] for added protection against ICBM threats to the homeland. This interceptor has the potential to offer an additional defensive capability to ease the burden on the GBI system and provide continuing protection for the U.S. homeland against evolving rogue states' long-range missile capabilities. Congress has directed DoD to examine the feasibility of the SM-3 Blk IIA against an ICBM-class target. MDA will test this SM-3 Blk IIA capability in 2020. Due to the mobility of sea-based assets, this new underlay capability will be surged in a crisis or conflict to further thicken defensive capabilities for the U.S. homeland. Land-based sites in the United States with this SM-3 Blk IIA missile could also be pursued. A March 18, 2019, press report states: The Pentagon plans a ""first-of-its-kind"" test of an unprecedented weapons capability to intercept and destroy an enemy Intercontinental Ballistic Missile ""ICBM"" -- from a Navy ship at sea using a Standard Missile-3 Block IIA. The concept, as articulated by Pentagon officials and cited briefly in this years' DoD ""Missile Defense Review,"" would be to use an advanced SM-3 IIA to ""underlay"" and assist existing Ground-Based Interceptors (GBI), adding new dimensions to the current US missile defense posture.… The testing, Pentagon officials tell Warrior, is slated for as soon as next year. The effectiveness and promise of the Raytheon-built SM-3 IIA shown in recent testing have inspired Pentagon weapons developers to envision an even broader role for the weapon. The missile is now ""proven out,"" US weapons developers say…. ""The SM-3 IIA was not designed to take out ICBMs, but is showing great promise. This would be in the upper range of its capability -- so we are going to try,"" the Pentagon official told Warrior…. The SM-3 IIA's size, range, speed and sensor technology, the thinking suggests, will enable it to collide with and destroy enemy ICBMs toward the beginning or end of their flight through space, where they are closer to the boundary of the earth's atmosphere. ""The SM-3 IIA would not be able to hit an ICBM at a high altitude, but it can go outside the earth's atmosphere,"" the Pentagon official said. ""You want to hit it as far away as possible because a nuke could go off."" A March 26, 2018, press report states the following: [MDA] Director Lt. Gen. Sam Greaves said MDA ""is evaluating the technical feasibility of the capability of the SM-3 Block IIA missile, currently under development, against an ICBM-class target."" ""If proven to be effective against an ICBM, this missile could add a layer of protection, augmenting the currently deployed GMD [ground-based missile defense] system,"" Greaves said in written testimony submitted March 22 to the Senate Armed Services strategic forces subcommittee. [Greaves] said MDA will conduct a demonstration of the SM-3 Block IIA against an ICBM-like target by the end of 2020."" The BMD interceptor missiles used by Aegis ships are the Standard Missile-3 (SM-3), the SM-2 Block IV, and the SM-6. The SM-3 is designed to intercept ballistic missiles above the atmosphere (i.e., exo-atmospheric intercept), in the midcourse phase of an enemy ballistic missile's flight. It is equipped with a ""hit-to-kill"" warhead, called a kinetic vehicle, that is designed to destroy a ballistic missile's warhead by colliding with it. MDA and Navy plans call for fielding increasingly capable versions of the SM-3 in coming years. The current versions, called the SM-3 Block IA and SM-3 Block IB, are to be supplemented in coming years by SM-3 Block IIA. Compared to the Block IA version, the Block IB version has an improved (two-color) target seeker, an advanced signal processor, and an improved divert/attitude control system for adjusting its course. Compared to the Block IA and 1B versions, which have a 21-inch-diameter booster stage at the bottom but are 13.5 inches in diameter along the remainder of their lengths, the Block IIA version has a 21-inch diameter along its entire length. The increase in diameter to a uniform 21 inches provides more room for rocket fuel, permitting the Block IIA version to have a burnout velocity (a maximum velocity, reached at the time the propulsion stack burns out) that is greater than that of the Block IA and IB versions, as well as a larger-diameter kinetic warhead. The United States and Japan have cooperated in developing certain technologies for the Block IIA version, with Japan funding a significant share of the effort. The SM-2 Block IV is designed to intercept ballistic missiles inside the atmosphere (i.e., endo-atmospheric intercept), during the terminal phase of an enemy ballistic missile's flight. It is equipped with a blast fragmentation warhead. The existing inventory of SM-2 Block IVs—72 as of February 2012—was created by modifying SM-2s that were originally built to intercept aircraft and ASCMs. A total of 75 SM-2 Block IVs were modified, and at least 3 were used in BMD flight tests. MDA and the Navy are now procuring a more capable terminal-phase (endo-atmospheric intercept) BMD interceptor based on the SM-6 air defense missile (the successor to the SM-2 air defense missile). The SM-6 is a dual-capability missile that can be used for either air defense (i.e., countering aircraft and anti-ship cruise missiles) or ballistic missile defense. A July 23, 2018, press report states the following: The Defense Department has launched a prototype project that aims to dramatically increase the speed and range of the Navy's Standard Missile-6 by adding a larger rocket motor to the ship-launched weapon, a move that aims to improve both the offensive and defensive reach of the Raytheon-built system. On Jan. 17, the Navy approved plans to develop a Dual Thrust Rocket Motor with a 21-inch diameter for the SM-6, which is currently fielded with a 13.5-inch propulsion package. The new rocket motor would sit atop the current 21-inch booster, producing a new variant of the missile: the SM-6 Block IB. On September 17, 2009, the Obama Administration announced a new approach for regional BMD operations called the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA). The first application of the approach is in Europe, and is called the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA). EPAA calls for using BMD-capable Aegis ships, a land-based radar in Europe, and two Aegis Ashore sites in Romania and Poland to defend Europe against ballistic missile threats from countries such as Iran. Phase I of EPAA involved deploying Aegis BMD ships and a land-based radar in Europe by the end of 2011. Phase II involved establishing the Aegis Ashore site in Romania with SM-3 IB interceptors in 2016. Phase 3 involves establishing the Aegis Ashore site in Poland with SM-3 IIA interceptors by perhaps FY2020. The completion of construction of the Poland site has been delayed by at least a year, MDA says, due to contractor performance issues. Each Aegis Ashore site in the EPAA is to include a structure housing an Aegis system similar to the deckhouse on an Aegis ship and 24 SM-3 missiles launched from a relocatable Vertical Launch System (VLS) based on the VLS that is installed in Navy Aegis ships. Although BMD-capable Aegis ships were deployed to European waters before 2011, the first BMD-capable Aegis ship officially deployed to European waters as part of the EPAA departed its home port of Norfolk, VA, on March 7, 2011, for a deployment to the Mediterranean that lasted several months. Under the FY2020 budget submission, the number of BMD-capable Navy Aegis ships is projected to increase from 38 at the end of FY2018 to 59 at the end of FY2024. During the period FY2018-FY2024, the portion of the force equipped with earlier Aegis variants is to decrease, and the number equipped with later variants is to increase. On October 5, 2011, the United States, Spain, and NATO jointly announced that, as part of the EPAA, four BMD-capable Aegis ships were to be forward-homeported (i.e., based) at the naval base at Rota, Spain. The four ships were transferred to Rota in FY2014 and FY2015. Navy officials have said that the four Rota-based ships can provide a level of level of presence in the Mediterranean for performing BMD patrols and other missions equivalent to what could be provided by about 10 BMD-capable Aegis ships that are homeported on the U.S. east coast. The Rota homeporting arrangement thus effectively releases about six U.S. Navy BMD-capable Aegis ships for performing BMD patrols or other missions elsewhere. The Aegis BMD development effort, including Aegis BMD flight tests, has been described as following a development philosophy long held within the Aegis program office of ""build a little, test a little, learn a lot,"" meaning that development is done in manageable steps, then tested and validated before moving on to the next step. For a summary of Aegis BMD flight tests since 2002, see Appendix A . Japan is modifying all six of its Aegis destroyers to include the Aegis BMD capability. As of August 2017, four of the six ships reportedly had been modified, and Japan planned to modify a fifth by March 2018, or perhaps sooner than that. In November 2013, Japan announced plans to procure two additional Aegis destroyers and equip them as well with the Aegis BMD capability, which will produce an eventual Japanese force of eight BMD-capable Aegis destroyers. The two additional ships are expected to enter service in 2020 and 2021. Japanese BMD-capable Aegis ships have participated in some of the flight tests of the Aegis BMD system using the SM-3 interceptor (see Table A-1 in Appendix A ). Japan cooperated with the United States on development the SM-3 Block IIA missile. Japan developed certain technologies for the missile, and paid for the development of those technologies, reducing the missile's development costs for the United States. Japan plans to procure and operate two Aegis Ashore systems that reportedly are to be located at Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) facilities in Akita Prefecture in eastern Japan and Yamaguchi Prefecture in western Japan, and would be operated mainly by the GSDF (i.e., Japan's army). The two systems reportedly will be equipped with a new Lockheed-made radar called the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) rather than the Raytheon-made SPY-6 AMDR that is being installed on U.S. Navy Flight III DDG-51s, and reportedly will go into operation by 2023. A July 6, 2018, press report states that ""The U.S. and Japan are looking to jointly develop next-generation radar technology that would use Japanese semiconductors to more than double the detection range of the Aegis missile defense system."" An October 12, 2018, press report states that ""the South Korean military has decided to buy ship-based SM-3 interceptors to thwart potential ballistic missile attacks from North Korea, a top commander of the Joint Chiefs of Staff revealed Oct. 12. Other countries that MDA views as potential naval BMD operators (using either the Aegis BMD system or some other system of their own design) include the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Spain, Germany, Denmark, and Australia. Spain, South Korea, and Australia either operate, are building, or are planning to build Aegis ships. The other countries operate destroyers and frigates with different combat systems that may have potential for contributing to BMD operations. The Aegis BMD program is funded mostly through MDA's budget. The Navy's budget provides additional funding for BMD-related efforts. Table 1 shows MDA procurement and research and development funding for the Aegis BMD program. Research and development funding for the land-based SM-3 is funding for Aegis Ashore sites. MDA's budget also includes additional funding not shown in the table for operations and maintenance (O&M) and military construction (MilCon) for the Aegis BMD program. One issue for Congress is whether to approve, reject, or modify MDA's FY2019 procurement and research and development funding requests for the program. In considering this issue, Congress may consider various factors, including whether the work that MDA is proposing to fund for FY2019 is properly scheduled for FY2019, and whether this work is accurately priced. Another potential issue for Congress concerns required numbers of BMD-capable Aegis ships versus available numbers of BMD-capable Aegis ships. Some observers are concerned about the potential operational implications of a shortfall in the available number of BMD-capable relative to the required number. Regarding the required number of BMD-capable Aegis ships, an August 15, 2018, Navy information paper states the following: The [Navy's] 2016 Force Structure Assessment [FSA] sets the requirement [for BMD-capable ships] at 54 BMD-capable ships, as part of the 104 large surface combatant requirement, to meet Navy unique requirements to support defense of the sea base and limited expeditionary land base sites…. The minimum requirement for 54 BMD ships is based on the Navy unique requirement as follows. It accepts risk in the sourcing of combatant commander (CCDR) requests for defense of land. - 30 to meet CVN escort demand for rotational deployment of the carrier strike groups - 11 INCONUS for independent BMD deployment demand - 9 in forward deployed naval forces (FDNF) Japan to meet operational timelines in USINDOPACOM - 4 in FDNF Europe for rotational deployment in EUCOM. A related potential issue for Congress is the burden that BMD operations may be placing on the Navy's fleet of Aegis ships, particularly since performing BMD patrols requires those ships to operate in geographic locations that may be unsuitable for performing other U.S. Navy missions, and whether there are alternative ways to perform BMD missions now performed by U.S. Navy Aegis ships, such as establishing more Aegis Ashore sites. A June 16, 2018, press report states the following: The U.S. Navy's top officer wants to end standing ballistic missile defense patrols and transfer the mission to shore-based assets. Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson said in no uncertain terms on June 12 that he wants the Navy off the tether of ballistic missile defense patrols, a mission that has put a growing strain on the Navy's hard-worn surface combatants, and the duty shifted towards more shore-based infrastructure. ""Right now, as we speak, I have six multi-mission, very sophisticated, dynamic cruisers and destroyers―six of them are on ballistic missile defense duty at sea,"" Richardson said during his address at the U.S. Naval War College's Current Strategy Forum. ""And if you know a little bit about this business you know that geometry is a tyrant. ""You have to be in a tiny little box to have a chance at intercepting that incoming missile. So, we have six ships that could go anywhere in the world, at flank speed, in a tiny little box, defending land."" Richardson continued, saying the Navy could be used in emergencies but that in the long term the problem demands a different solution. ""It's a pretty good capability and if there is an emergent need to provide ballistic missile defense, we're there,"" he said. ""But 10 years down the road, it's time to build something on land to defend the land. Whether that's AEGIS ashore or whatever, I want to get out of the long-term missile defense business and move to dynamic missile defense."" The unusually direct comments from the CNO come amid growing frustration among the surface warfare community that the mission, which requires ships to stay in a steaming box doing figure-eights for weeks on end, is eating up assets and operational availability that could be better used confronting growing high-end threats from China and Russia. The BMD mission was also a factor in degraded readiness in the surface fleet. Amid the nuclear threat from North Korea, the BMD mission began eating more and more of the readiness generated in the Japan-based U.S. 7th Fleet, which created a pressurized situation that caused leaders in the Pacific to cut corners and sacrifice training time for their crews, an environment described in the Navy's comprehensive review into the two collisions that claimed the lives of 17 sailors in the disastrous summer of 2017. Richardson said that as potential enemies double down on anti-access technologies designed to keep the U.S. Navy at bay, the Navy needed to focus on missile defense for its own assets. ""We're going to need missile defense at sea as we kind of fight our way now into the battle spaces we need to get into,"" he said. ""And so restoring dynamic maneuver has something to do with missile defense. A June 23, 2018, press report states the following: The threats from a resurgent Russia and rising China―which is cranking out ships like it's preparing for war―have put enormous pressure on the now-aging [U.S. Navy Aegis destroyer] fleet. Standing requirements for BMD patrols have put increasing strain on the U.S. Navy's surface ships. The Navy now stands at a crossroads. BMD, while a burden, has also been a cash cow that has pushed the capabilities of the fleet exponentially forward over the past decade. The game-changing SPY-6 air and missile defense radar destined for DDG Flight III, for example, is a direct response to the need for more advanced BMD shooters. But a smaller fleet, needed for everything from anti-submarine patrols to freedom-of-navigation missions in the South China Sea, routinely has a large chunk tethered to BMD missions. ""Right now, as we speak, I have six multimission, very sophisticated, dynamic cruisers and destroyers―six of them are on ballistic missile defense duty at sea,"" Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson said during an address at the recent U.S. Naval War College's Current Strategy Forum. ""You have to be in a tiny little box to have a chance at intercepting that incoming missile. So we have six ships that could go anywhere in the world, at flank speed, in a tiny little box, defending land."" And for every six ships the Navy has deployed in a standing mission, it means 18 ships are in various stages of the deployment cycle preparing to relieve them. The Pentagon, led by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, wants the Navy to be more flexible and less predictable―""dynamic"" is the buzzword of moment in Navy circles. What Richardson is proposing is moving standing requirements for BMD patrols away from ships underway and all the associated costs that incurs, and toward fixed, shore-based sites, and also surging the Navy's at-sea BMD capabilities when there is an active threat.... In a follow-up response to questions posed on the CNO's comments, Navy spokesman Cmdr. William Speaks said the Navy's position is that BMD is an integral part of the service's mission, but where long-term threats exist, the Navy should ""consider a more persistent, land-based solution as an option."" ""This idea is not about the nation's or the Navy's commitment to BMD for the U.S. and our allies and partners―the Navy's commitment to ballistic missile defense is rock-solid,"" Speaks said. ""In fact, the Navy will grow the number of BMD-capable ships from 38 to 60 by 2023, in response to the growing demand for this capability. ""The idea is about how to best meet that commitment. In alignment with our national strategic documents, we have shifted our focus in an era of great power competition―this calls us to think innovatively about how best to meet the demands of this mission and optimize the power of the joint force.""... While the idea of saving money by having fixed BMD sites and freeing up multimission ships is sensible, it may have unintended consequences, said Bryan McGrath, a retired destroyer skipper and owner of the defense consultancy The FerryBridge Group. ""The BMD mission is part of what creates the force structure requirement for large surface combatants,"" McGrath said on Twitter after Defense News reported the CNO's comments. ""Absent it, the number of CG's and DDG's would necessarily decline. This may in fact be desirable, depending on the emerging fleet architecture and the roles and missions debate underway. Perhaps we need more smaller, multi-mission ships than larger, more expensive ones. ""But it cannot be forgotten that while the mission is somewhat wasteful of a capable, multi-mission ship, the fact that we have built the ships that (among other things) do this mission is an incredibly good thing. If there is a penalty to be paid in peacetime sub-optimization in order to have wartime capacity--should this not be considered a positive thing?"" McGrath went on to say that the suite of combat systems that have been built into Aegis have been in response to the BMD threat. And indeed, the crown jewels of the surface fleet―Aegis Baseline 9 software, which allows a ship to do both air defense and BMD simultaneously; the Aegis common-source library; the forthcoming SPY-6; cooperative engagement―have come about either in part or entirely driven by the BMD mission.... A Navy official who spoke on condition of anonymity, to discuss the Navy's shifting language on BMD, acknowledged the tone had shifted since the 2000s when the Navy latched onto the mission. But the official added that the situation more than a decade later has dramatically shifted. ""The strategic environment has changed significantly since the early 2000s―particularly in the western Pacific. We have never before faced multiple peer rivals in a world as interconnected and interdependent as we do today,"" the official said. ""Nor have we ever seen technologies that could alter the character of war as dramatically as those we see emerging around us. China and Russia have observed our way of war and are on the move to reshape the environment to their favor."" In response to the threat and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis' desire to use the force more dynamically, the Navy is looking at its options, the official said. ""This includes taking a look at how we employ BMD ships through the lens of great power competition to compete, deter and win against those who threaten us."" A January 29, 2019, press report states the following: The Navy is looking to get out of the missile defense business, the service's top admiral said today, and the Pentagon's new missile defense review might give the service the off-ramp it has been looking for to stop sailing in circles waiting for ground-based missile launches. This wasn't the first time Adm. John Richardson bristled in public over his ships sailing in ""small boxes"" at sea tasked with protecting land, when they could be out performing other missions challenging Chinese and Russian adventurism in the South China Sea and the North Atlantic…. ""We've got exquisite capability, but we've had ships protecting some pretty static assets on land for a decade,"" Richardson said at the Brookings Institute. ""If that [stationary] asset is going to be a long-term protected asset, then let's build something on land and protect that and liberate these ships from this mission."" Japan is already moving down the path of building up a more robust ground-based sensor and shooter layer, while also getting its own ships out to sea armed with the Aegis radar and missile defense system, both of which would free up American hulls from what Richardson on Monday called ""the small [geographic] boxes where they have to stay for ballistic missile defense."" Another related potential issue for Congress concerns burden sharing—how allied contributions to regional BMD capabilities and operations compare to U.S. naval contributions to overseas regional BMD capabilities and operations, particularly in light of constraints on U.S. defense spending, worldwide operational demands for U.S. Navy Aegis ships, and calls by some U.S. observers for increased allied defense efforts. The issue can arise in connection with both U.S. allies in Europe and U.S. allies in Asia. Regarding U.S. allies in Asia, a December 12, 2018, press report states the following: In June, US Navy Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Admiral John Richardson said during a speech at the US Naval War College that the US Navy should terminate its current practice of dedicating several US Navy warships solely for Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD). Richardson wanted US warships to halt BMD patrols off Japan and Europe as they are limiting, restrictive missions that could be better accomplished by existing land-based BMD systems such as Patriot anti-missile batteries, the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system and the Aegis Ashore anti-missile system. In the months since dropping his bombshell, Richardson—and much of the debate—has gone quiet. ""My guess is the CNO got snapped back by the Pentagon for exceeding where the debate actually stood,"" one expert on US naval affairs told Asia Times. But others agree with him. Air Force Lt Gen Samuel A Greaves, the director of the US Missile Defense Agency (MDA), acknowledges Richardson's attempts to highlight how these BMD patrols were placing unwelcome ""strain on the (US Navy's) crews and equipment."" But there are complications. While it may free US Navy warships for sea-control, rather than land defense, there is a concern that next- generation hypersonic cruise missiles could defeat land-based BMD systems, such as Aegis Ashore, while the US Navy's Aegis-equipped warships offer the advantages of high-speed mobility and stealth, resulting in greater survivability overall. As Japan prepares to acquire its first Aegis Ashore BMD system – and perhaps other systems such as the THAAD system which has been deployed previously in Romania and South Korea – the possibility that the US Navy will end its important BMD role represents abrupt change…. Japan's decision to deploy Aegis Ashore can fill in any gap created by a possible US Navy cessation of BMD patrols. ""The land-based option is more reliable, less logistically draining, and despite being horrendously expensive, could be effective in the sense that it provides a degree of reassurance to the Japanese people and US government, and introduces an element of doubt of missile efficacy into [North Korean] calculations,"" said [Garren Mulloy, Associate Professor of International Relations at Daito Bunka University in Saitama, Japan], adding, however, that these systems could not cover Okinawa. ""Fixed sites in Japan could be vulnerable, and the Aegis vessels provide a flexible forward-defense, before anything enters Japanese airspace, but with obviously limited reactions times,"" Mulloy said. ""Aegis Ashore gives more reaction time – but over Japanese airspace.""… The silence about this sudden possible shift in the US defense posture in the western Pacific is understandable: it is a sensitive topic in Washington and Tokyo. However, the Trump administration has urged its allies to pay more for their own defense needs and to support US troops deployed overseas. Meanwhile, Tokyo needs to proceed cautiously given the likelihood that neighbors might view a move on BMD as evidence that Tokyo is adopting an increasingly aggressive defense posture in the region. But for them, it is a no-win situation. If the US does ditch the BMD patrol mission, China and North Korea might view the shift as equally menacing given that it greatly enhances the US Navy's maritime warfare capabilities. Another potential issue for Congress is whether to convert the Aegis test facility in Hawaii into an operational land-based Aegis BMD site. DOD's January 2019 missile defense review report states, in a section on improving or adapting existing BMD systems, that Another repurposing option is to operationalize, either temporarily or permanently, the Aegis Ashore Missile Defense Test Center in Kauai, Hawaii, to strengthen the defense of Hawaii against North Korean missile capabilities. DoD will study this possibility to further evaluate it as a viable near-term option to enhance the defense of Hawaii. The United States will augment the defense of Hawaii in order to stay ahead of any possible North Korean missile threat. MDA and the Navy will evaluate the viability of this option and develop an Emergency Activation Plan that would enable the Secretary of Defense to operationalize the Aegis Ashore test site in Kauai within 30 days of the Secretary's decision to do so, the steps that would need to be taken, associated costs, and personnel requirements. This plan will be delivered to USDA&S, USDR&E, and USDP within six months of the release of the MDR. A January 25, 2019, press report states the following: The Defense Department will examine the funding breakdown between the Navy and the Missile Defense Agency should the government make Hawaii's Aegis Ashore Missile Defense Test Center into an operational resource, according to the agency's director. ""Today, it involves both Navy resources for the operational crews -- that man that site -- as well as funds that come to MDA for research, development and test production and sustainment,"" Lt. Gen. Sam Greaves said of the test center when asked how the funding would shake out between the Navy and MDA should the Pentagon move forward with the recommendation. Another potential issue for Congress concerns the potential for ship-based lasers, electromagnetic railguns (EMRGs), and gun-launched guided projectiles (GLGPs, previously known as hypervelocity projectiles [HVPs]) to contribute in coming years to Navy terminal-phase BMD operations and the impact this might eventually have on required numbers of ship-based BMD interceptor missiles. Another CRS report discusses the potential value of ship-based lasers, EMRGs, and GLGPs for performing various missions, including, potentially, terminal-phase BMD operations. Another potential oversight issue for Congress is technical risk and test and evaluation issues in the Aegis BMD program. Regarding this issue, a December 2018 report from DOD's Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E)—DOT&E's annual report for FY2018—stated the following in its section on the Aegis BMD program: Assessment • Results from flight testing, high-fidelity M&S, HWIL, and distributed ground testing demonstrate that Aegis BMD can intercept non-separating, simple-separating, and complex-separating ballistic missiles in the midcourse phase. However, flight testing and M&S did not address all expected threat types, ground ranges, and raid sizes. • FTM-45 successfully and fully demonstrated the Aegis BL 9.2 organic engagement capability and corrective action for the previous FTM-29 missile failure. FTM-29 was only partially able to demonstrate EOR capability given the in-flight missile failure. In FTM-29, the Aegis Weapon System supported the SM-3 Block IIA missile and demonstrated bi-directional communication between the SM-3 Block IIA guidance section and the KW until loss of signal at horizon. However, the weapon system did not exercise all aspects of communication after KW eject. DOT&E considers the FTM-29 failure to be an example of a shortfall in conducting ground testing in an operationally representative way, and an example of a deficiency found in OT that DT should have discovered. • The MDA implemented process improvements to better identify, report, and fi x common failures and anomalies identified during SM-3 ground testing prior to flight testing. • SM CTV-03 demonstrated the capability of the Aegis BMD 4.1 upgrade to fi re an SM-6 Dual I missile. The BMD 4.1 build incorporates BL 9.C1 capabilities into the BMD 4.0 baseline. • FS-17 demonstrated the Aegis BMD 4.0.3 capability to interoperate with NATO partners over operational communication architectures during cruise missile and ballistic missile engagements, and to use remote data provided by NATO partners to prosecute remote engagements. JFTM-05 Event 2 demonstrated inter-ship communication between U.S. and Japanese destroyers using a realistic communications architecture while prosecuting ballistic missile engagements. Pacific Dragon demonstrated interoperability between U.S. Aegis BMD assets, Japanese destroyers, and Republic of Korea naval assets. • Aegis BMD has exercised rudimentary engagement coordination with Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense firing units, but not with Patriot. The MDA plans to include Patriot in FTO-03. MDA ground tests have routinely demonstrated that inter-element coordination and interoperability need improvement to increase situational awareness and improve engagement efficiency. • The MDA has been collaborating with DOT&E and the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) to establish an affordable ground testing approach to support assessments of reliability. DOT&E cannot assess SM-3 missile reliability with confidence until the MDA is able to provide additional ground test data that simulates the in-flight environment. DOT&E is working with the MDA to determine if existing ground test venues are able to provide the needed missile reliability data. Recommendations The MDA should: 1. Ensure that ground tests of all SM-3 missile components, sections, and all-up rounds use the same configuration as will be flown in flight tests (i.e., ""test as you fly""). 2. Determine how to properly score acceptance ground test data for production missiles to enable their use in estimating SM-3 reliability. 3. Fund and execute high-fidelity M&S RFRs for Aegis BL 9.2 SM-3 Block IIA and SM-6 Dual II scenarios that span the engagement battlespace. Regarding the SM-6 missile, the January 2018 DOT&E report also stated the following: Assessment • As reported in the DOT&E FY18 SM-6 BLK I FOT&E Report, the SM-6 remains effective and suitable with the exception of the classified deficiency identified in the FY13 IOT&E Report. The SM-6 Block 1 satisfactorily demonstrated compatibility with Aegis Weapon System Baseline 9 Integrated Fire Control capability. • In FY17-18, the Navy developed and tested specific software improvements to SM-6 BLK I to mitigate the classified performance problems discovered during IOT&E. As previously reported, testing conducted by the Navy demonstrated the software improvements perform as intended, but did not eliminate them. Recommendation 1. The Navy should continue to improve software based on IOT&E results and verify corrective actions with flight tests. Table 2 summarizes congressional action on the FY2020 request for MDA procurement and research and development funding for the Aegis BMD program. Appendix A. Aegis BMD Flight Tests Table A-1 presents a summary of Aegis BMD flight tests since January 2002. As shown in the table, since January 2002, the Aegis BMD system has achieved 33 successful exo-atmospheric intercepts in 42 attempts using the SM-3 missile (including 4 successful intercepts in 5 attempts by Japanese Aegis ships, and 2 successful intercepts in 3 attempts attempt using the Aegis Ashore system), and 7 successful endo-atmospheric intercepts in 7 attempts using the SM-2 Block IV and SM-6 missiles, making for a combined total of 40 successful intercepts in 49 attempts. In addition, on February 20, 2008, a BMD-capable Aegis cruiser operating northwest of Hawaii used a modified version of the Aegis BMD system with the SM-3 missile to shoot down an inoperable U.S. surveillance satellite that was in a deteriorating orbit. Including this intercept in the count increases the totals to 34 successful exo-atmospheric intercepts in 43 attempts using the SM-3 missile, and 41 successful exo- and endo-atmospheric intercepts in 50 attempts using SM-3, SM-2 Block IV, and SM-6 missiles.\n\n","[""The Aegis ballistic missile defense (BMD) program, which is carried out by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and the Navy, gives Navy Aegis cruisers and destroyers a capability for conducting BMD operations. Under the FY2020 budget submission, the number of BMD-capable Navy Aegis ships is projected to increase from 38 at the end of FY2018 to 59 at the end of FY2024. BMD-capable Aegis ships operate in European waters to defend Europe from potential ballistic missile attacks from countries such as Iran, and in in the Western Pacific and the Persian Gulf to provide regional defense against potential ballistic missile attacks from countries such as North Korea and Iran. The Aegis BMD program is funded mostly through MDA's budget. The Navy's budget provides additional funding for BMD-related efforts. MDA's proposed FY2020 budget requests a total of $1,784.2 million (i.e., about $1.8 billion) in procurement and research and development funding for Aegis BMD efforts, including funding for two Aegis Ashore sites in Poland and Romania. MDA's budget also includes operations and maintenance (O&M) and military construction (MilCon) funding for the Aegis BMD program. Issues for Congress regarding the Aegis BMD program include the following: whether to approve, reject, or modify MDA's FY2020 funding procurement and research and development funding requests for the program; required numbers of BMD-capable Aegis ships versus available numbers of BMD-capable Aegis ships; the burden that BMD operations may be placing on the Navy's fleet of Aegis ships, and whether there are alternative ways to perform BMD missions now performed by U.S. Navy Aegis ships, such as establishing more Aegis Ashore sites; burden sharing—how allied contributions to regional BMD capabilities and operations compare to U.S. naval contributions to overseas regional BMD capabilities and operations; whether to convert the Aegis test facility in Hawaii into an operational land-based Aegis BMD site; the potential for ship-based lasers, electromagnetic railguns (EMRGs), and hypervelocity projectiles (HVPs) to contribute in coming years to Navy terminal-phase BMD operations and the impact this might eventually have on required numbers of ship-based BMD interceptor missiles; and technical risk and test and evaluation issues in the Aegis BMD program.""]","6599","gov_report","en","None","20b5876304722f112df8dc629cf778d75beae3ca7887d6fd","Summary:","gov_report","532","\nThe Aegis ballistic missile defense (BMD) program is a key component of the U.S. and allied nav"
"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nU.S. agencies perform a wide variety of activities that contribute to export promotion, and responsibility for these activities is widely dispersed. Some of the services these agencies provide are intended, at least in part, to assist U.S. companies in entering foreign markets or expanding their presence abroad. For example, the U.S. government distributes trade-related information to exporters, conducts foreign country market research, and provides counseling to U.S. companies throughout the export process. U.S. agencies may also use diplomatic tools to advocate on behalf of U.S. companies to help ensure they can compete on a level playing field in export markets. Three of these agencies—State, Commerce, and USDA—receive appropriations that are restricted from being used to promote the sale or export of U.S. tobacco or tobacco products. These agencies promote the growth of other U.S. exports through various activities, as discussed in table 1. Congress has restricted the use of funds that are generally appropriated for State, Commerce, and USDA from being used to promote the sale or export of U.S. tobacco and tobacco products since the 1990s. In 1990, we reported that U.S. policy and programs for assisting the export of tobacco and tobacco products worked at cross purposes to U.S. health policy and initiatives, both domestically and internationally. Congress later restricted the use of funds that are generally appropriated to State, Commerce, and USDA from being used to promote the sale or export of U.S. tobacco and tobacco products. During fiscal years 1994 through 2003, Congress prohibited funds generally appropriated for USDA through annual appropriations acts from being used to promote the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco products. In fiscal year 2004, Congress permanently prohibited funds appropriated for USDA from being used to promote the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco products. According to USDA officials, USDA stopped its efforts to gather and disseminate tobacco-related production and consumption information overseas in the early 2000s. Congress restricted the use of certain appropriated funds, including appropriations for Commerce and State, from being used to promote the sale or export of U.S. tobacco and tobacco products from fiscal years 1998 through 2017. Congress passed the Departments of Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998, which prohibited the funds provided by the act from being used to promote the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco products. This act also prohibited the funds provided by the act from being used to seek the reduction or removal of foreign country restrictions on the marketing of tobacco or tobacco products. The act provided an exception for the funds to be used to address foreign-country restrictions on tobacco marketing that are not applied equally to all tobacco or tobacco products of the same type. These restrictions have been enacted through annual appropriations acts through fiscal year 2018. In fiscal year 2018, Congress altered the restriction language on tobacco promotion in the act making appropriations for State, which, according to State, makes promotion activities permissive with respect to the use of State appropriations. Congress used the term “should” in the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2018 (2018 State Appropriations Act) instead of the term “shall” as in prior acts making appropriations for State. Specifically, the 2018 State Appropriations Act states that “None of the funds made available by this Act should be available to promote the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco products. . . .” In contrast, prior acts making appropriations for State stated “None of the funds made available by this Act shall be available to promote the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco products. . . .” According to State officials, they interpreted the term “shall” in prior appropriations acts as a mandatory action, whereas the use of the term “should” gives the agency more discretion in how it addresses the restrictions. However, State has not changed how it addresses the restrictions and does not plan to promote the sale or export of U.S. tobacco, according to State officials. The legislation restricting fiscal year 2018 appropriations provided to Commerce and USDA from being used to promote tobacco retains the mandatory “shall” language. According to Commerce and USDA officials, the change to State’s restriction language does not affect the agencies’ activities because Commerce and USDA are still subject to the mandatory restrictions outlined in their agencies’ appropriations language. State collaborates with Commerce, USDA, and other agencies to develop and periodically issue an interagency guidance cable to implement funding restrictions on promoting tobacco. According to officials, this cable serves as the primary source of guidance for implementing the restrictions on promoting tobacco for their officials at all posts overseas. State collaborates with Commerce, USDA, and other agencies to develop and periodically issue an interagency guidance cable to all posts overseas to facilitate their implementation of funding restrictions on promoting tobacco. State officials draft the updated cable and Commerce, USDA, and other agency officials have the opportunity to review and comment on it before State issues it through its cable system. This cable serves as the primary source of guidance for implementing the restrictions, according to officials at these agencies (see table 2). State has updated and issued the interagency guidance cable four times since 2013 to address changes in tobacco technology and other emerging issues, according to State officials. We identified two significant changes to the cable over the past 5 years. Addition of information concerning attendance at corporate social responsibility events: In May 2013, State added a provision that post officials should consult with headquarters before attending corporate social responsibility events involving U.S. tobacco companies. State officials in headquarters acknowledged that post officials may not link some activities, such as participating in corporate social responsibility events, to the promotion of or selling of products. They noted that this is why it is important to make post officials aware of the actions they should or should not take through the interagency guidance cable. Changes to the scope of tobacco products: In recent updates to the cable, State expanded the description of “tobacco and tobacco products” to address the emergence of new delivery systems for tobacco. Specifically, in 2014 State added the language “tobacco delivering products, such as electronic cigarettes” to provide an example of a tobacco product. In 2016, State changed the description to “electronic nicotine delivery systems such as e-cigarettes.” Then in 2018, State added “non-combustible products such as smokeless tobacco” to the description of tobacco products. In response to the revised funding restriction language in the 2018 State Appropriations Act, State modified the 2018 cable stating that the changes make promotion activities permissive with respect to the use of State appropriations. However, State decided not to change the portion of the cable describing specific actions officials should or should not take in the version it issued in April 2018, because according to State officials, they do not plan to promote tobacco. In addition, Commerce and USDA officials said that the change to State’s restriction language has not changed how they interpret the guidance. Commerce relies on both the interagency guidance cable as well as its client eligibility policy to implement restrictions on promoting tobacco. Commerce’s client eligibility policy applies to all export promotion services that Commerce provides and educates officials on how to effectively manage U.S. company requests for commercial assistance. The policy’s section on exceptions and other bases for declining services to companies states that Commerce is prohibited by law from promoting the export of tobacco or tobacco-related products. Commerce issued its updated client eligibility policy in October 2018. USDA relies on the interagency guidance cable to provide direction to its officials overseas, and does not have agency-specific guidance for implementing its permanent funding restrictions on promoting tobacco. USDA officials said that the cable sufficiently addresses the funding restrictions on the agency’s promotion activities and helps to ensure that all officials serving at posts overseas conduct activities in a consistent manner. Most State, Commerce, and USDA officials overseas we interviewed were aware of the restrictions on promoting tobacco. Most officials we interviewed had received some guidance concerning the restrictions, but several officials did not recall receiving the interagency guidance cable. Moreover, two of the agencies’ current training courses do not address the restrictions. Officials in 21 of the 24 offices overseas we interviewed were aware of the restrictions. The three offices that were not aware of the restrictions were from State. Although these officials were not aware of the restrictions, they said they had never provided services to U.S. tobacco companies. Commerce and USDA headquarters officials said that it is widely known within their agencies that staff should not promote tobacco. Commerce and USDA officials said the guidance concerning these restrictions has been consistent for many years and that staff in the field and in headquarters are very aware of the restrictions. Most officials overseas had received some guidance concerning the restrictions on promoting tobacco. Officials in 21 of the 24 offices overseas we interviewed had received written or verbal guidance concerning the restrictions on promoting tobacco at some point in their career. For example, officials in 15 offices mentioned receiving the State-issued interagency guidance cable when we asked them what type of tobacco-related guidance they had received. In addition, officials in four of the eight Commerce offices recalled receiving agency-specific guidance. Some officials said that their supervisors had informed them they are not allowed to promote tobacco exports. Some officials did not recall receiving the interagency guidance cable, which agency officials said serves as the primary source of guidance for implementing the restrictions, and some were not aware that State periodically issues the cable. For example, one USDA official stated that he could not recall the last time he received guidance and noted that cables can easily be overlooked. He recommended that USDA improve its efforts to distribute the cable and have supervisors maintain an annual checklist to ensure staff have read and understand it or incorporate it into annual training. A State official told us that he was in Washington, D.C. when State issued the prior cable and he did not learn about it until he had been stationed at his next overseas post for several months. A Commerce official noted that some officials new to post may not receive the interagency guidance cable for several months. All officials working overseas can access the interagency guidance cable through the State cable database or access other resources if a tobacco- related issue arises. For example, the Commerce client eligibility policy and the interagency guidance cable are available on an internal Commerce website. USDA officials in headquarters stated that they do not remind officials overseas about the restrictions or available guidance, but that, in response to our audit work, they plan to send an annual reminder. Finally, many post officials we interviewed said that they are aware of the activities their colleagues are undertaking and would have the opportunity to educate their colleagues before they provided any services to a tobacco company. Officials in 15 of the 24 offices overseas we interviewed said they did not receive any training concerning restrictions on promoting tobacco. In the past, State, Commerce, and USDA did not include information about the funding restrictions or related guidance in training materials. State and USDA officials in headquarters confirmed that training materials for officials conducting export promotion activities overseas do not address funding restrictions on promoting tobacco. According to an official at State’s Foreign Service Institute, tobacco products may be discussed in a trade-related course when describing those products officials should not advocate for, or in the 6-month economic studies course when examining the nexus between trade issues and public policy. However, State could not provide documentation of where this is specifically addressed in its curriculum. A USDA official stated that none of the Foreign Agricultural Service training courses explicitly discuss restrictions on promoting tobacco. According to Commerce officials, the training for new trade specialists did not include information about the restrictions on promoting tobacco when Commerce last provided the training in 2014. However, in response to our audit work, Commerce added this information into its training materials for new trade specialists in September 2018. Officials who do not receive training on the restrictions early in their careers may not be aware that they are prohibited from promoting tobacco. For example, one Commerce official told us he did not know about the restrictions while serving at his first post when he attended a meeting that involved representatives from the tobacco industry. He noted that he now questions whether he would have attended the meeting if he had known about the restrictions. Federal internal control standards state that appropriate training, aimed at developing employee knowledge, skills, and abilities, is essential to an organization’s operational success. If agencies do not explicitly include information about the restrictions and related guidance in training materials for officials conducting export promotion activities overseas, officials may work at a post for several months, or longer, before learning about the restrictions. The State, Commerce, and USDA officials we interviewed said they have implemented the funding restrictions on tobacco as outlined in the interagency guidance cable issued by State. For example, post officials said they have not promoted the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco products or attended events solely sponsored by tobacco companies, though many officials said they attended events at which officials from tobacco companies were present. Post officials identified three areas of the guidance that may benefit from additional clarification, according to interviews with agency officials and our review of agency emails. Our interviews with State, Commerce, and USDA officials in 24 offices in nine countries and our review of agency documents, showed that posts have implemented the interagency guidance outlining actions they should not take (see table 3.) Post officials identified three areas of the guidance that may benefit from additional clarification, according to our interviews with agency officials and our review of agency emails: attendance at events, the types of permitted services, and the description of tobacco products. Officials from all three agencies raised questions about whether and when it is permissible to attend events at which tobacco company representatives are present. The guidance does not specifically address attendance at events also attended by representatives of tobacco companies. State headquarters officials said the vast majority of questions received from posts concern whether personnel at a post may participate in an event when representatives from a company engaged in the tobacco industry are also expected to participate in that event. We also reviewed emails in which Commerce officials asked for additional guidance about attending events or meetings with tobacco companies. For example, one post official asked whether the embassy could invite a tobacco company to participate in an embassy-organized trade mission that would include meetings with the local governor and mayor. In this case, Commerce headquarters officials advised that the tobacco company’s participation could be construed as U.S. government support for the company’s commercial activities and recommended against including the tobacco company. A USDA official in headquarters also noted that attending events could, in some cases, be construed as supporting tobacco companies, and noted that this is an area where staff could use more guidance. Representatives from several tobacco control organizations expressed concern that interactions between U.S. government officials and representatives from tobacco companies at events organized by business associations created a perception that the U.S. government supported tobacco company sales in the country. For example, in 2017 a business association hosted a trade mission to one Southeast Asian country that included representatives from 30 U.S. companies, including a U.S. tobacco company. In response, two tobacco control organizations wrote to the U.S. ambassador in that country voicing their concern that U.S. government officials’ attendance at meetings that included the tobacco company representatives violated the spirit of the interagency guidance cable and gave the appearance that the U.S. government supports the tobacco company. Subsequently, the Deputy Chief of Mission distributed guidance specific to that post stating that officials were not allowed to attend a trade mission’s events or meetings if representatives from a tobacco company were scheduled to give a presentation. Several post officials said that attending events organized by business associations is a key function of their job. They attend these events to, among other things, exchange information about the local business climate and learn about the concerns of American companies. Commerce and USDA officials identified ambiguities in the guidance concerning the types of services they are allowed to provide to tobacco companies or the tobacco industry. In 14 of the 21 Commerce emails we reviewed, officials at posts asked for additional guidance about the types of services they are permitted to provide to tobacco companies or the types of companies or products they can support. For example, some post officials asked whether they could engage with the host country government to obtain information about pending tobacco-related legislation at the request of a tobacco company. In one case, Commerce headquarters advised post officials that the restrictions did not prohibit them from raising concerns on a legislative proposal that would discriminate against foreign tobacco companies. They further noted that because of the sensitive nature of tobacco-related issues, any policy decision to engage should be weighed carefully. Commerce’s client eligibility policy does not provide a description of the types of actions Commerce officials should and should not take with regards to tobacco companies and products. The interagency guidance cable also does not provide information about some types of services, such as whether officials should engage with host country government officials to learn about pending tobacco-related legislation. According to a USDA official, some officials overseas interpret “promotional” activities differently and did not agree on whether both marketing and trade-related activities, such as enforcing trade agreements, are promotional activities. Commerce officials at post asked for additional guidance about whether they could provide export promotion services to companies exporting certain tobacco-related products in 3 of the 21 emails we reviewed. For example, some Commerce officials asked whether they could provide services to companies selling component parts for electronic nicotine delivery systems, such as e-liquids. Commerce’s prior client eligibility policy, issued in May 2017, did not include a list of tobacco products covered by the policy; whereas, the interagency guidance cable issued in 2014 states that tobacco products include tobacco delivery systems, such as electronic cigarettes, and the updated version issued in 2018 added non-combustible products, such as smokeless tobacco, to this description. However, neither the interagency guidance cable nor Commerce’s updated client eligibility policy specifically states whether the description includes component parts for electronic cigarettes and other tobacco products. GAO previously reported that electronic cigarettes include a wide range of products that share the same basic design and generally consist of three main parts: a power source, a heating element, and a cartridge or tank containing liquid solution, which is often sold separately. According to State officials in headquarters, the guidance on promoting tobacco was written for a broad audience and to make post officials mindful of the restrictions. They said they trust that officials overseas will use their professional judgment and in-country expertise to determine if post’s support for an event or a company will be construed as promotion of a tobacco product. Moreover, State and Commerce officials said that they expect officials overseas to ask headquarters questions to clarify the interagency guidance cable. While federal standards for internal control state that management should clearly document internal controls in policies and guidance to prevent officials from failing to achieve an objective or address a risk, we found that the interagency guidance does not provide examples of the factors post officials should consider when attending business association events. The guidance also lacks sufficient examples of the types of services officials are allowed to provide to tobacco companies and a clear description of tobacco products. More specific guidance would help ensure that State, Commerce, and USDA officials consistently implement their agency-specific funding restrictions on promoting tobacco exports. The United States exported over $2 billion in tobacco and tobacco-related products in 2017. Congress has enacted restrictions on the use of certain appropriated funds to promote the sale or export of U.S. tobacco or tobacco products since the 1990s, and State, Commerce, and USDA have developed and updated guidance to implement these restrictions. However, not all officials were aware of the restrictions and more than half had not received training about the restrictions. Including information about the restrictions in training materials would help make officials aware of the restrictions early in their careers and prompt them to seek guidance if a tobacco-related issue arises. If officials conducting export promotion activities are unaware of the funding restrictions on promoting tobacco sales and exports, they may also be unaware of the activities they should and should not undertake. Moreover, some officials said that the guidance is unclear in some areas. Although officials said they need to attend business association events to support all U.S. companies conducting business in a country, they were unsure whether they can attend events where representatives from U.S. tobacco companies may be present. In addition, some officials also indicated that the current guidance lacks clarity on the types of services officials are allowed to provide to tobacco interests and what constitutes a tobacco product. Although we did not identify any instances in which a State, Commerce, or USDA official directly promoted U.S. tobacco products, clearer guidance would help to ensure that officials will consistently implement their agency-specific funding restrictions. We are making three recommendations, including two to State and one to USDA. Specifically: The Secretary of State should work with the Foreign Service Institute to include information about the funding restrictions and relevant guidance on promoting the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco products in its training materials for employees conducting export promotion activities overseas. (Recommendation 1) The Secretary of Agriculture should include information about the funding restrictions and relevant guidance on promoting the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco products in training materials for employees conducting export promotion activities overseas. (Recommendation 2) The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Agriculture, should assess the interagency guidance cable on promoting tobacco in light of questions raised by officials at posts overseas and update it to address ambiguities, as needed. (Recommendation 3) We provided a draft of this report to State, Commerce, USDA, and USTR for review and comment. In their comments, reproduced in appendix III, State concurred with our recommendations and described planned actions to address them. USDA concurred with the recommendation and told us that they had no comments on the draft report. Commerce and USTR told us that they had no comments on the draft report. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of the Department of State, the Secretary of the Department of Commerce, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Trade Representative, and other interested parties. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-3149 or gootnickd@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix IV. This report examines (1) the guidance select U.S. agencies have issued to implement funding restrictions on promoting tobacco exports overseas, (2) to what extent overseas officials from select U.S. agencies were aware of the restrictions and guidance, and (3) to what extent select U.S. agencies have implemented this guidance overseas. To address our first objective, we reviewed U.S. appropriations laws that prohibited the funds appropriated therein from being used to promote the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco products. We also reviewed guidance issued by the Departments of State (State) and Commerce (Commerce) concerning the promotion of tobacco exports overseas. We also interviewed officials in headquarters from State, Commerce, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) about the funding restrictions on promoting tobacco exports overseas and the development and revision of guidance on tobacco promotion. To address our second objective, we interviewed officials in headquarters from State, Commerce, and USDA about any training officials posted overseas receive concerning the funding restrictions on promoting tobacco exports. In addition, we held structured interviews with 35 State, Commerce, and USDA officials overseas conducting export promotion activities and reached out to an additional 10 officials to ask about activities associated with the solicitation of gifts and attendance at corporate social responsibility events. These officials were located across 11 posts and in 9 countries. We interviewed officials in Cambodia, Croatia, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Indonesia, Philippines, South Africa, Thailand, and Vietnam. Because multiple officials from one agency attended a meeting in some cases, we are reporting their combined responses as one “office” response. Thus, we are reporting the results from the 24 offices we interviewed—9 State, 8 Commerce, and 7 USDA offices. We selected this non-generalizable sample of countries based on criteria that included the countries’ large or increasing amounts of U.S. tobacco imports, relatively high tobacco smoking prevalence rates, and geographic dispersion. The information obtained from these interviews is neither generalizable nor reflects the experiences of all State, Commerce, and USDA officials serving at posts overseas, but it does provide insights into officials’ experiences at post and illustrative examples across our sample on the topics discussed. To address our third objective, we interviewed officials in headquarters from State, Commerce, and USDA about post officials’ implementation of guidance regarding the promotion of tobacco exports, the types of questions they receive from post officials about the funding restrictions and guidance, and the additional advice they provide to post officials overseas. We asked post officials about the clarity of guidance, whether they attended events sponsored or attended by representatives of U.S. tobacco companies, and whether they discussed tobacco-related issues with host country government officials during our structured interviews with the 24 State, Commerce, and USDA offices overseas. We also analyzed a Commerce database, agency emails, and State cables and conducted a literature search. Commerce documents all the fee-based services it provides to companies in a database. We obtained a list of approximately 30,000 fee-based services Commerce provided in fiscal years 2013 through 2017, which included the name of the companies to which Commerce provided these services. We then downloaded a list of 763 U.S. tobacco companies from Nexus using criteria such as industry classification codes related to tobacco and tobacco products and the location of company headquarters. We limited the list of U.S. tobacco companies to those with revenues greater than $5 million. We then compared the two lists to determine if Commerce provided any fee-based services to U.S. tobacco companies. To assess the reliability of the Commerce fee-based services data, we reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed knowledgeable officials about system controls. We determined that Commerce’s fee-based services data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives. In addition, we requested State, Commerce, and USDA email communications concerning tobacco-related issues sent between January 2015 and February 2018 from post officials to headquarters. State was only able to provide one such email. USDA provided several emails, but the emails were not from USDA post officials to USDA officials in headquarters. Commerce provided us 21 emails that matched our request and an additional 20 emails from officials working throughout the United States. We analyzed the Commerce email communications to identify commonly asked questions or concerns about the existing guidance and actions the agencies should take to support U.S. tobacco companies or the tobacco industry. We also requested State cables from the eight countries in our sample sent between January 2013 and December 2017 that referenced at least 1 of the 10 U.S. tobacco companies with the highest revenues. We received and reviewed cables from six of these countries. We also conducted a literature search to identify instances in which U.S. government officials may have conducted activities addressed by the interagency tobacco guidance cable. To identify relevant articles, such as trade or industry articles, we searched various databases, including ProQuest and Nexus. From these sources, we identified one article relevant to our research objective. We performed these searches in December 2017 and searched for articles published from January 2013 to December 2017. We also interviewed representatives of the tobacco control community and business associations to obtain their perspectives concerning U.S. government support for tobacco exports and U.S. government interactions with U.S. tobacco companies. Specifically, we interviewed the World Health Organization (WHO), four global or regional tobacco control nongovernmental organizations, and several local nongovernmental organizations in two countries in our scope. In addition, we interviewed officials from the local American Chamber of Commerce and the U.S.- Association of Southeast Asian Nations Business Council in two countries. The information obtained from these interviews is neither generalizable nor reflects the experiences of all tobacco control organizations or business associations, but it does provide insights into these officials’ experiences. We conducted this performance audit from November 2017 to December 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. The United States exported over $2.1 billion in tobacco and tobacco products in 2017. Figure 1 shows how tobacco exports fluctuated from 2007 to 2017. Specifically, total tobacco exports have ranged from a high of approximately $2.4 billion in 2007 to a low of about $1.7 billion in 2012. U.S. tobacco exports to Asia have decreased by 68 percent over the past 11 years, whereas exports to North America have increased 10-fold (see fig. 2). Most of the decrease in exports to Asia is attributable to reduced exports to Japan, which fell 95 percent from 2007 to 2017. Most of the increases in exports to North America are attributable to Canada, which accounted for approximately 40 percent of total U.S. tobacco exports in 2017. David B.

Since the 1990s, Congress has enacted restrictions regarding the use of certain appropriated funds to promote U.S. tobacco exports. GAO was asked to review the implementation of these restrictions. This report examines (1) guidance select U.S. agencies have issued to implement these restrictions, (2) whether overseas officials from select U.S. agencies were aware of the restrictions and guidance, and (3) select U.S. agencies' implementation of the guidance overseas. GAO reviewed U.S. laws, agency guidance, and internal communications; analyzed Commerce data; and interviewed agency officials in Washington, D.C. and in 24 offices across 11 overseas posts in 9 countries. GAO selected these countries based on criteria that included U.S. tobacco export totals, smoking rates, and geographic dispersion. Congress has restricted the use of certain appropriated funding to promote tobacco exports and the Departments of State (State), Commerce (Commerce), and Agriculture (USDA) have issued interagency guidance through the cable system that they rely on to implement these restrictions. State collaborates with these and other agencies to periodically update this cable. The cable informs officials about the types of actions they should take—such as providing routine business facilitation services to all U.S. companies—and the types of actions they should not take—such as attending events sponsored by tobacco companies. Most, but not all, officials overseas that GAO interviewed were aware of the restrictions and received some guidance concerning the restrictions. However, GAO found that some officials did not recall receiving the interagency guidance cable. In addition, State and USDA's current training materials do not address the restrictions. Federal internal control standards state that appropriate training is essential to an organization's operational success. Thus, providing officials overseas with training about the funding restrictions and related guidance would help to ensure that officials are aware of the restrictions. U.S. officials overseas have implemented restrictions on promoting tobacco, but some officials said that the interagency guidance lacks clarity. Officials said that they have not promoted tobacco by, for example, attending events sponsored solely by tobacco companies. However, officials identified three areas of the guidance that are unclear: (1) attendance at events not sponsored by U.S. tobacco companies but attended by representatives of these companies; (2) the types of services officials can provide tobacco companies; and (3) the description of tobacco products, such as whether component parts for electronic cigarettes are included. Federal standards for internal control state that management should clearly document internal controls in policies and guidance to prevent officials from failing to achieve an objective or address a risk. By providing more specific guidance, the agencies would help ensure that officials consistently implement the funding restrictions on promoting tobacco. GAO recommends that (1) State and USDA include information about the funding restrictions and guidance in training materials for relevant employees and (2) State, in consultation with Commerce and USDA, assess and update the interagency guidance cable, as needed, on promoting tobacco in light of questions raised by officials at posts overseas. State and USDA concurred with the recommendations.""]","5128","gov_report","en","None","62d13b7a4d82174165aff7eb6ed3bd7b4cb0b87255a7173e","Summary:","gov_report","532","\nThe report examines the implementation of U.S. agencies' guidance on promoting the sale or export of tobacco products overseas.

"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nWe found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VA medical centers required reviews of a total of 148 providers’ clinical care after concerns were raised about their care, but officials at these medical centers could not provide documentation to show that almost half of these reviews were conducted. We found that all five VA medical centers lacked at least some documentation of the reviews they told us they conducted, and in some cases, we found that the required reviews were not conducted at all. Specifically, across the five VA medical centers, we found the following: The medical centers lacked documentation showing that one type of review—focused professional practice evaluations (FPPE) for cause—had been conducted for 26 providers after concerns had been raised about their care. FPPEs for cause are reviews of providers’ care over a specified period of time, during which the provider continues to see patients and has the opportunity to demonstrate improvement. Documentation of these reviews is explicitly required under VHA policy. Additionally, VA medical center officials confirmed that FPPEs for cause that were required for another 21 providers were never conducted. The medical centers lacked documentation showing that retrospective reviews—which assess the care previously delivered by a provider during a specific period of time— had been conducted for 8 providers after concerns had been raised about their clinical care. One medical center lacked documentation showing that reviews had been conducted for another 12 providers after concerns had been raised about their care. In the absence of any documentation, we were unable to identify the types of reviews, if any, that were conducted for these 12 providers. We also found that the five selected VA medical centers did not always conduct reviews of providers’ clinical care in a timely manner. Specifically, of the 148 providers, the VA medical centers did not initiate reviews of 16 providers for 3 months, and in some cases, for multiple years, after concerns had been raised about the providers’ care. In a few of these cases, additional concerns about the providers’ clinical care were raised before the reviews began. We found that two factors were largely responsible for the inadequate documentation and untimely reviews of providers’ clinical care we identified at the selected VA medical centers. First, VHA policy does not require VA medical centers to document all types of reviews of providers’ clinical care, including retrospective reviews, and VHA has not established a timeliness requirement for initiating reviews of providers’ clinical care. Second, VHA’s oversight of the reviews of providers’ clinical care is inadequate. Under VHA policy, networks are responsible for overseeing the credentialing and privileging processes at their respective VA medical centers. While reviews of providers’ clinical care after concerns are raised are a component of credentialing and privileging, we found that none of the network officials we spoke with described any routine oversight of such reviews. This may be in part because the standardized tool that VHA requires the networks to use during their routine audits does not direct network officials to ensure that all reviews of providers’ clinical care have been conducted and documented. Further, some of the VISN officials we interviewed told us they were not using the standardized audit tool as required. Without adequate documentation and timely completion of reviews of providers’ clinical care, VA medical center officials lack the information they need to make decisions about providers’ privileges, including whether or not to take adverse privileging actions against providers. Furthermore, because of its inadequate oversight, VHA lacks reasonable assurance that VA medical center officials are reviewing all providers about whom clinical care concerns have been raised and are taking adverse privileging actions against the providers when appropriate. To address these shortcomings, we recommended that VHA 1) require documentation of all reviews of providers’ clinical care after concerns have been raised, 2) establish a timeliness requirement for initiating such reviews, and 3) strengthen its oversight by requiring networks to oversee VA medical centers to ensure that such reviews are documented and initiated in a timely manner. VA concurred with these recommendations and described plans for VHA to revise existing policy and update the standardized audit tool used by the networks to include more comprehensive oversight of VA medical centers’ reviews of providers’ clinical care after concerns have been raised. We found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five VA medical centers we reviewed had only reported one of nine providers required to be reported to the NPDB under VHA policy. These nine providers either had adverse privileging actions taken against them or resigned or retired while under investigation before an adverse privileging action could be taken. None of these nine providers were reported to state licensing boards as required by VHA policy. The VA medical centers documented that these nine providers had significant clinical deficiencies that sometimes resulted in adverse outcomes for veterans. For example, the documentation shows that one provider’s surgical incompetence resulted in numerous repeat surgeries for veterans. Another provider’s opportunity to improve through an FPPE for cause had to be halted and the provider was removed from providing care after only a week due to concerns that continuing the review would potentially harm patients. In addition to these nine providers, one VA medical center terminated the services of four contract providers based on deficiencies in the providers’ clinical performance, but the facility did not follow any of the required steps for reporting providers to the NPDB or relevant state licensing boards. This is concerning, given that the VA medical center documented that one of these providers was terminated for cause related to patient abuse after only 2 weeks of work at the facility. Two of the five VA medical centers we reviewed each reported one provider to the state licensing boards for failing to meet generally accepted standards of clinical practice to the point that it raised concerns for the safety of veterans. However, we found that the medical centers’ reporting to the state licensing board took over 500 days to complete in both cases, which was significantly longer than the 100 days suggested in VHA policy. Across the five VA medical centers, we found that providers were not reported to the NPDB and state licensing boards as required for two reasons. First, VA medical center officials were generally not familiar with or misinterpreted VHA policies related to NPDB and state licensing board reporting. For example, at one VA medical center, we found that officials failed to report six providers to the NPDB because they were unaware that they had been delegated responsibility for NPDB reporting. Officials at two other VA medical centers incorrectly told us that VHA cannot report contract providers to the NDPB. At another VA medical facility, officials did not report a provider to the NPDB or to any of the state licensing boards where the provider held a medical license because medical center officials learned that one state licensing board had already found out about the issue independently. Therefore, VA officials did not believe that they needed to report the provider. This misinterpretation of VHA policy meant that the NPDB and the state licensing boards in other states where the provider held licenses were not alerted to concerns about the provider’s clinical practice. Second, VHA policy does not require the networks to oversee whether VA medical centers are reporting providers to the NPDB or state licensing boards when warranted. We found, for example, that network officials were unaware of situations in which VA medical center officials failed to report providers to the NPDB. We concluded that VHA lacks reasonable assurance that all providers who should be reported to these entities are reported. VHA’s failure to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards as required facilitates providers who provide substandard care at one facility obtaining privileges at another VA medical center or at hospitals outside of VA’s health care system. We found several cases of this occurring among the providers who were not reported to the NPDB or state licensing boards by the five VA medical centers we reviewed. For example, we found that two of the four contract providers whose contracts were terminated for clinical deficiencies remained eligible to provide care to veterans outside of that VA medical center. At the time of our review, one of these providers held privileges at another VA medical center, and another participated in the network of providers that can provide care for veterans in the community. We also found that a provider who was not reported as required to the NPDB during the period we reviewed had their privileges revoked 2 years later by a non-VA hospital in the same city for the same reason the provider was under investigation at the VA medical center. Officials at this VA medical center did not report this provider following a settlement agreement under which the provider agreed to resign. A committee within the VA medical center had recommended that the provider’s privileges be revoked prior to the agreement. There was no documentation of the reasons why this provider was not reported to the NPDB under VHA policy. To improve VA medical centers’ reporting of providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards and VHA oversight of these processes, we recommended that VHA require its networks to establish a process for overseeing VA medical centers to ensure they are reporting to the NPDB and to state licensing boards and to ensure that this reporting is timely. VA concurred with this recommendation and told us that it plans to include oversight of timely reporting to the NPDB and state licensing boards as part of the standard audit tool used by the networks.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center (VAMC) officials are responsible for reviewing the clinical care delivered by their privileged providers—physicians and dentists who are approved to independently perform specific services—after concerns are raised. The five VAMCs GAO selected for review collectively required review of 148 providers from October 2013 through March 2017 after concerns were raised about their clinical care. GAO found that these reviews were not always documented or conducted in a timely manner. GAO identified these providers by reviewing meeting minutes from the committee responsible for requiring these types of reviews at the respective VAMCs, and through interviews with VAMC officials. The selected VAMCs were unable to provide documentation of these reviews for almost half of the 148 providers. Additionally, the VAMCs did not start the reviews of 16 providers for 3 months to multiple years after the concerns were identified. GAO found that VHA policies do not require documentation of all types of clinical care reviews and do not establish timeliness requirements. GAO also found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) does not adequately oversee these reviews at VAMCs through its Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which are responsible for overseeing the VAMCs. Without documentation and timely reviews of providers' clinical care, VAMC officials may lack information needed to reasonably ensure that VA providers are competent to provide safe, high quality care to veterans and to make appropriate decisions about these providers' privileges. GAO also found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VAMCs did not report most of the providers who should have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) or state licensing boards (SLB) in accordance with VHA policy. The NPDB is an electronic repository for critical information about the professional conduct and competence of providers. GAO found that selected VAMCs did not report to the NPDB eight of nine providers who had adverse privileging actions taken against them or who resigned during an investigation related to professional competence or conduct, as required by VHA policy, and none of these nine providers had been reported to SLBs. GAO found that officials at the selected VAMCs misinterpreted or were not aware of VHA policies and guidance related to NPDB and SLB reporting processes resulting in providers not being reported. GAO also found that VHA and the VISNs do not conduct adequate oversight of NPDB and SLB reporting practices and cannot reasonably ensure appropriate reporting of providers. As a result, VHA's ability to provide safe, high quality care to veterans is hindered because other VAMCs, as well as non-VA health care entities, will be unaware of serious concerns raised about a provider's care. For example, GAO found that after one VAMC failed to report to the NPDB or SLBs a provider who resigned to avoid an adverse privileging action, a non-VA hospital in the same city took an adverse privileging action against that same provider for the same reason 2 years later.""]","1743","gov_report","en","None","bced7d8c4f573d1008fbdd146e9671ebbcea8251a2432687","Summary:","gov_report","532","\nThe report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reveals significant concerns about the documentation and timeliness of reviews for clinical care at five selected VA medical centers.

"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nT he Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to review certain types of federal agency actions that fall under the statutory category of ""rules."" Enacted in 1996 as part of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, the CRA requires agencies to report the issuance of ""rules"" to Congress and provides Congress with special procedures under which to consider legislation to overturn those rules. A joint resolution of disapproval will become effective once both houses of Congress pass a joint resolution and it is signed by the President, or if Congress overrides the President's veto. For an agency's action to be eligible for review under the CRA, it must qualify as a ""rule"" as defined by the statute. The class of rules covered by the CRA is broader than the category of rules that are subject to the Administrative Procedure Act's (APA's) notice-and-comment requirements. As such, some agency actions, such as guidance documents, that are not subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures may still be considered rules under the CRA and thus could be overturned using the CRA's procedures. The 115 th Congress used the CRA to pass, for the first time, a resolution of disapproval overturning an agency guidance document that had not been promulgated through notice-and-comment procedures. The resolution was signed into law by the President on May 21, 2018. In all of the previous instances in which the CRA was used to overturn agency actions, the disapproved actions were regulations that had been adopted through APA rulemaking processes. Congress's use of the CRA in this instance raised questions about the scope of the CRA and Congress's ability to use the CRA to overturn agency actions that were not promulgated through APA notice-and-comment procedures. Under the CRA, the expedited procedures for considering legislation to overturn rules become available only when agencies submit their rules to Congress. In many cases in which agencies take actions that meet the legal definition of a ""rule"" but have not gone through notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures, however, agencies fail to submit those rules. Thus, questions have arisen as to how Members can use the CRA's procedures to overturn agency actions when an agency does not submit the action to Congress. This report first describes what types of agency actions can be overturned using the CRA by providing a close examination and discussion of the statutory definition of ""rule."" The report then explains how Members can use the CRA to overturn agency rules that have not been submitted to Congress. Under the CRA, before a rule can take effect, an agency must submit to both houses of Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) a report containing a copy of the rule and information on the rule, including a summary of the rule, a designation of whether the rule is ""major,"" and the proposed effective date of the rule. For most rules determined to be ""major,"" the agency must allow for an additional period to elapse before the rule can take effect—primarily to give Congress additional time to consider taking action on the most economically impactful rules—and GAO must write a report on each major rule to the House and Senate committees of jurisdiction within 15 days. The report is to contain GAO's assessment of the agency's compliance with various procedural steps in the rulemaking process. After a rule is received by Congress, Members have the opportunity to use expedited procedures to overturn the rule. A Member must submit the resolution of disapproval and Congress must take action on it within certain time periods specified in the CRA to take advantage of the expedited procedures, which exist primarily in the Senate. Those expedited, or ""fast track,"" procedures include the following: a Senate committee can be discharged from the further consideration of a CRA joint resolution disapproving the rule by a petition signed by at least 30 Senators; any Senator may make a nondebatable motion to proceed to consider the disapproval resolution, and the motion to proceed requires a simple majority for adoption; and if the motion to proceed is successful, the CRA disapproval resolution would be subject to up to 10 hours of debate, and then voted upon. No amendments are permitted and the disapproval resolution requires a simple majority to pass. If both houses pass the joint resolution, it is sent to the President for signature or veto. If the President were to veto the resolution, Congress could vote to override the veto under normal veto override procedures. If a joint resolution of disapproval is submitted and acted upon within the CRA-specified deadlines and signed by the President (or if Congress overrides the President's veto), the CRA states that the ""rule shall not take effect (or continue)."" In other words, if part or all of the rule had already taken effect, the rule would be deemed not to have had any effect at any time. If a rule is disapproved, the status quo that was in place prior to the issuance of the rule would be reinstated. In addition, when a joint resolution of disapproval is enacted, the CRA provides that a rule may not be issued in ""substantially the same form"" as the disapproved rule unless it is specifically authorized by a subsequent law. The CRA does not define what would constitute a rule that is ""substantially the same"" as a nullified rule. The CRA governs ""rules"" promulgated by a ""federal agency,"" using the definition of ""agency"" provided in the APA. That APA definition broadly defines an agency as ""each authority of the Government of the United States, ... but does not include ... Congress; ... the courts of the United States; ... courts martial and military commissions."" Accordingly, the CRA generally covers rules issued by most executive branch entities. In the context of the APA, however, courts have held that this definition excludes actions of the President. The more difficult interpretive issue is what types of agency actions should be considered ""rules"" under the CRA. The CRA adopts a broad definition of the word ""rule"" from the APA, but then creates three exceptions to that definition. This APA definition of ""rule"" encompasses a wide range of agency action, including certain agency statements that are not subject to the notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements outlined elsewhere in the APA: ""[R]ule"" means the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency and includes the approval or prescription for the future of rates, wages, corporate or financial structures or reorganizations thereof, prices, facilities, appliances, services or allowances therefor or of valuations, costs, or accounting, or practices bearing on any of the foregoing[.] The CRA narrows this definition by providing that the term ""rule"" does not include (A) any rule of particular applicability, including a rule that approves or prescribes for the future rates, wages, prices, services, or allowances therefor, corporate or financial structures, reorganizations, mergers, or acquisitions thereof, or accounting practices or disclosures bearing on any of the foregoing; (B) any rule relating to agency management or personnel; or (C) any rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties. Determining whether any particular agency action is a rule subject to the CRA therefore entails a two-part inquiry: first, asking whether the statement qualifies as a rule under the APA definition and, second, asking whether the statement falls within any of the exceptions noted above to the CRA's definition of rule. These two steps are illustrated below in Figure 1 . This section of the report walks through the two elements of this inquiry in more detail. First, while the APA's definition of ""rule"" is expansive, courts have held that ""Congress did not intend that the ... definition ... be construed so broadly that every agency action"" should be encompassed under this provision. As a preliminary matter, courts have distinguished agency rulemaking actions from adjudicatory and investigatory functions. And under the statutory text, to qualify as a rule, an agency statement must meet three requirements: it must be ""of general ... applicability,"" have ""future effect,"" and be ""designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy."" Second, even if an agency statement does qualify as an APA ""rule,"" the CRA expressly exempts three categories of rules from its provisions: rules ""of particular applicability,"" rules ""relating to agency management or personnel,"" and ""any rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties."" Both inquiries are heavily fact specific, and require looking beyond a document's label to the substance of the agency's action. The CRA defines the word ""rule"" by incorporating in part the APA's definition of that term. Although there is very little case law interpreting the meaning of ""rule"" under the CRA, cases interpreting the APA's definition of ""rule"" may provide persuasive authority for interpreting the CRA because the CRA explicitly relies on that provision as the basis for its own definition of the term ""rule."" The APA provides a general framework governing most agency action—not only agency rulemaking, but also administrative adjudications. The APA accordingly distinguishes different types of agency actions, separating rules from orders and investigatory acts. These distinctions may also be relevant when deciding whether an agency action is a rule subject to the CRA. The APA distinguishes a ""rule"" from an ""order,"" defining an ""order"" as ""the whole or a part of a final disposition, whether affirmative, negative, injunctive, or declaratory in form, of an agency in a matter other than rule making but including licensing."" Orders are the product of agency adjudication, in contrast to rules, which result from rulemaking. To determine whether an agency action is a rule or an order in the context of the APA, courts look beyond the document's label to the substance of the action. One federal court of appeals described the distinction between rulemaking and adjudication as follows: First, adjudications resolve disputes among specific individuals in specific cases, whereas rulemaking affects the rights of broad classes of unspecified individuals.... Second, because adjudications involve concrete disputes, they have an immediate effect on specific individuals (those involved in the dispute). Rulemaking, in contrast, is prospective, and has a definitive effect on individuals only after the rule subsequently is applied. Courts have also distinguished rules from agency investigations. A separate provision of the APA addresses an agency's authority to compel the submission of information and perform ""investigative act[s] or demand[s]."" When agencies conduct investigative actions such as requiring regulated parties to submit informational reports, courts have held that they are not subject to the APA's rulemaking requirements. However, courts have also noted that some actions related to investigations may qualify as rules. For instance, in one case, a federal court of appeals observed that the procedures governing an agency's decision to investigate ""are separate from and precede the agency's ultimate act,"" concluding that the procedures at issue constituted a rule. An agency statement will qualify as a ""rule"" under the APA definition if it (1) is ""of general or particular applicability,"" (2) has ""future effect,"" and (3) is ""designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy."" With regard to the first requirement, as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) has noted, most agency statements will be ""of general or particular applicability"" and will fulfill this condition. The second requirement—that a rule be ""of ... future effect"" —is the subject of some ambiguity. Courts have largely agreed that this requirement is likely intended to distinguish agency rulemaking from agency adjudication. Courts often differentiate rules and orders by noting that orders are retrospective, while rules have ""future effect."" Rules operate prospectively, in the sense that they are intended to ""inform the future conduct"" of those subject to the rules. Additionally, courts have sometimes said that the ""future effect"" requirement excludes any agency statements that do not ""bind the agency."" Thus, for example, in a concurring opinion in a 1988 Supreme Court case, Justice Scalia suggested that the ""future effect"" requirement must be read to mean ""that rules have legal consequences only for the future."" He argued that the only way to distinguish rules from orders—which can have both future and past legal consequences—was to define rules as having only prospective operation. Judge Silberman of the D.C. Circuit, concurring in an opinion from that court, drew on Justice Scalia's interpretation of this requirement to argue that it would be unreasonable to conclude that every single agency statement with future effect is a rule under the APA. Instead, he argued that only agency statements that ""seek to authoritatively answer an underlying policy or legal issue"" should be considered rules. These opinions raise several unanswered questions, which could suggest some hesitation before reading the phrase ""future effect"" in the APA definition of a rule to mean ""binding."" First, these cases do not fully explain what it means for an agency statement to be binding or address the case law suggesting that the term ""future effect"" merely pertains to the prospective nature of the statement. Second, and perhaps more critical, this case law reading ""future effect"" to mean that APA ""rules"" must bind the agency does not explain how to distinguish this requirement from the separate inquiry into whether an agency action is subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. As discussed in more detail below, some (but not all) APA ""rules"" must go through procedures commonly known as notice-and-comment rulemaking. To distinguish so-called ""legislative"" rules that are subject to notice-and-comment procedures from ""interpretive"" rules, which are not, courts generally ask whether the rule has ""the force of law"" —or stated another way, whether the rule is ""legally binding."" Arguably, then, this ""legal effect"" test for notice-and-comment rulemaking may be equivalent to asking whether a rule binds an agency. However, the ""future effect"" inquiry tests whether an agency action is a ""rule"" under 5 U.S.C. §551(4), and the ""legal effect"" inquiry tests whether such a rule is subject to the notice-and-comment procedures outlined in 5 U.S.C. §553. Because the tests are tied to two distinct statutory provisions, they arguably should not both turn on whether a rule is legally binding. This is especially true where courts have generally held that interpretive rules may not be subject to notice-and-comment but are nonetheless ""rules"" within the meaning of the APA. The fact that Congress expressly exempted ""interpretative rules"" from the rulemaking procedures applicable to ""rules"" may itself suggest that such agency actions are rules—otherwise, the exemption would be unnecessary. The third requirement for an agency action to be considered an APA rule is that it must be ""designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy."" The D.C. Circuit has held that agency documents that merely state an ""established interpretation"" and ""tread no new ground"" do not ""implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy"" and therefore are not rules. Similarly, an agency statement is not a rule if it ""does not change any law or official policy presently in effect."" Thus, courts have concluded that ""educational"" documents that merely ""reprint[]"" or ""restate"" existing law are not rules under the APA. The D.C. Circuit has also held that an agency's budget request is not a rule. The APA outlines specific rulemaking procedures that agencies must follow when they formulate, amend, or repeal a rule. The APA generally requires publication in the Federal Register and institutes procedural requirements that are often referred to as notice-and-comment rulemaking. Under notice-and-comment rulemaking, agencies must notify the public of a proposed rule and then provide a meaningful opportunity for public comment on that rule. However, not all agency acts that qualify as ""rules"" under the APA definition are required to comply with the APA's rulemaking procedures. In particular, the APA provides that notice and comment is not required for ""interpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice."" Additionally, the APA's rulemaking procedures do not, in relevant part, apply to ""matter[s] relating to agency management or personnel."" Therefore, agency statements such as guidance documents or procedural rules may not be required to undergo notice-and-comment rulemaking, but may still be APA ""rules."" Courts frequently hold that agency's guidance documents are exempt from APA notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements because those documents are properly classified either as interpretative rules or as general policy statements. Interpretive rules merely explain or clarify preexisting legal obligations without themselves ""purport[ing] to impose new obligations or prohibitions,"" while general policy statements simply describe how an agency ""will exercise its broad enforcement discretion"" without binding the agency. But as mentioned above, the critical factor distinguishing both interpretive rules and general policy statements from ""legislative"" rules that must be promulgated through notice-and-comment procedures is ""whether the agency action binds private parties or the agency itself with the 'force of law,'"" or whether the rule ""has legal effect."" General policy statements ordinarily are not legally binding, and accordingly are not ""substantive"" rules required to undergo notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. It should be noted that some cases from the D.C. Circuit have suggested that general policy statements are not ""rules"" at all under the APA definition. For example, in one case, the D.C. Circuit said that the ""primary distinction between a substantive rule—really any rule—and a general statement of policy, then, turns on whether an agency intends to bind itself to a particular legal position."" As discussed above, courts have also sometimes held that where an agency statement does not ""bind"" an agency, it has no ""future effect"" and therefore cannot qualify as an APA ""rule."" This ""binding effect"" requirement has clear parallels to these cases holding that general policy statements are not rules because they do not bind the agency. However, these latter decisions do not explicitly ground this characterization of general policy statements in the text of the APA requiring rules to have ""future effect."" Accordingly, it is not clear how these two inquiries interrelate. Other cases have characterized general policy statements as APA rules, notwithstanding the fact that such a statement may not be legally binding in a future administrative proceeding. The CRA incorporates the APA definition of ""rule"" by reference, and, consequently, should likely be read to incorporate judicial constructions of that definition. Thus, for example, although the CRA does not itself reference agency ""orders,"" some courts have nonetheless imported the APA's distinction between rules and orders when interpreting the CRA. Accordingly, if an agency acts through an order or investigatory act, rather than a rule, the requirements of the CRA likely will not apply. In recent years, some commentators have discussed using the CRA to revoke agencies' guidance documents, raising the question of which guidance documents qualify as CRA ""rules."" As a preliminary matter, it is important to note that ""guidance document"" is not a defined term under either the CRA or the APA. Even if an agency has characterized a statement as a guidance document rather than a rule, it still may qualify as a ""rule"" under the CRA. Instead, the relevant question is whether any agency statement labeled as guidance—which could include, for example, actions such as memoranda, letters, or agency bulletins—falls within the statutory definition of ""rule"" and, if so, whether it is nonetheless exempt from the CRA under any of the exceptions to that definition. As discussed above, agency statements labeled as guidance are frequently exempt from the APA's notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures because they fall within the exceptions for interpretive rules or general policy statements. However, while the CRA adopts the APA's definition of rule, the CRA's exceptions to that definition are not identical to the APA's exemptions from its notice-and-comment procedures. Notably, the CRA does not exclude from its definition of rule either general policy statements or interpretative rules. Instead, the category of agency ""rules"" subject to the requirements of the CRA appears to encompass most ""rules"" that must go through the APA's notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures, along with some that do not. Consequently, agency guidance documents that are exempt from the APA's notice-and-comment procedural requirements may nonetheless be subject to the CRA, if they do not fall within one of the CRA's exceptions. But the effect of a disapproval resolution in such a case may be limited because such guidance documents generally lack legal effect in the first place. The post-enactment legislative history of the CRA indicates that the CRA was intended to encompass some agency statements that would not be subject to the APA's notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements. Following the enactment of the CRA in 1996, the law's sponsors inserted into the Congressional Record a statement in which they asserted that the law would cover a wide swath of agency actions: The committees intend this chapter to be interpreted broadly with regard to the type and scope of rules that are subject to congressional review. The term ""rule"" in subsection 804(3) begins with the definition of a ""rule"" in subsection 551(4) and excludes three subsets of rules that are modeled on APA sections 551 and 553. This definition of a rule does not turn on whether a given agency must normally comply with the notice-and-comment provisions of the APA.... The definition of ""rule"" in subsection 551(4) covers a wide spectrum of activities. This statement suggests that Congress intended the CRA to reach a broad range of agency activities, including agency policy statements, interpretive rules, and certain rules of agency organization, despite the fact that those actions are not subject to the APA's requirements for notice and comment. However, as discussed above, there is some ambiguity regarding whether certain non-binding statements are rules at all. If general policy statements or other non-binding agency actions are not ""rules"" under the APA definition, then arguably, they are not rules under the CRA. But importantly, GAO has concluded that general policy statements should be considered ""rules"" under the CRA. As discussed in more detail below, GAO's resolution of this issue may stand as the last word on the matter, given the role that GAO has come to play in advising Congress on which agency actions are subject to the CRA. Even if an agency action is a ""rule"" within the APA definition, it will not be subject to the CRA if it falls within one of the three exceptions to the CRA's definition of a ""rule."" The CRA incorporates the APA definition of rule, but exempts from that definition any rules ""of particular applicability,"" rules ""relating to agency management or personnel,"" and ""any rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties."" Some of these exemptions track language in the APA, and accordingly, cases interpreting those APA provisions may be useful to interpret the CRA exceptions. Additionally, the CRA does not ""apply to rules that concern monetary policy proposed or implemented by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee."" The CRA also contains a partial exception for rules where an agency has, ""for good cause,"" dispensed with notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures, as well as for rules related to ""a regulatory program for a commercial, recreational, or subsistence activity related to hunting, fishing, or camping ."" However, this section does not exempt rules from the CRA procedures entirely; it merely allows the agency to determine when the rule shall take effect, notwithstanding the CRA's requirements. While the APA's definition of ""rule"" includes agency statements ""of general or particular applicability,"" the CRA expressly exempts ""any rule of particular applicability."" Courts have said that this language refers to ""legislative-type promulgations"" that are ""directed to"" specifically named parties. In opinions from GAO analyzing whether various agency actions fall within the particular-applicability exception, GAO has stated that to be generally applicable, the CRA does not require a rule to ""generally apply to the population as a whole."" Instead, ""all that is required is a finding"" that a rule ""has general applicability within its intended range, regardless of the magnitude of that range."" For example, in one case, GAO concluded that an agency decision adopting and implementing a plan to counter decreased river flows in a certain river basin was not a matter of particular applicability. Although the decision applied to a specific geographic area, it would, in the view of GAO, nonetheless ""have significant economic and environmental impact throughout several major watersheds in the nation's largest state."" The CRA gives examples of some types of rules of particular applicability by specifying that this exemption includes any ""rule that approves or prescribes for the future rates, wages, prices, services, or allowances therefor, corporate or financial structures, reorganizations, mergers, or acquisitions thereof, or accounting practices or disclosures bearing on any of the foregoing."" Moreover, the post-enactment statement for the record written by the CRA's sponsors maintained that ""IRS private letter rulings and Customs Service letter rulings are classic examples of rules of particular applicability."" Under the APA, courts have also held, for example, that agency actions designating specific sites as covered by environmental laws are rules of ""particular applicability."" The second CRA exemption excludes ""any rule relating to agency management or personnel."" The APA contains a similar exemption from its general rulemaking requirements. Within the context of the APA, courts have concluded that this exemption covers agency statements such as policies for hiring employees. A rule will not fall within this exemption solely because it is ""directed at government personnel."" Instead, courts have viewed this APA exception to cover internal matters that do not substantially affect parties outside an agency. Notwithstanding the general presumption of courts that where Congress adopts language from another statute, it also intends to incorporate any settled judicial interpretations of that same language, it is unclear whether this substantial-effect requirement developed by courts in the context of the APA should be read into the CRA. The CRA's second exemption, for ""any rule relating to agency management or personnel,"" does not expressly mention a rule's effect on third parties. By contrast, the CRA's third exemption does. This distinction in language could be read to mean that Congress intentionally chose to create a substantial-effect requirement for the third exception while omitting this limitation from the second one, so that the CRA's second exception excludes ""any rule relating to agency management or personnel"" regardless of its impact on third parties. On this view, this difference in phrasing would displace the ordinary presumption that Congress incorporates case law interpreting similar statutory provisions. This interpretation of the second exemption could mean that the CRA's exception for rules relating to agency management or personnel may be interpreted more broadly than the APA exception. However, it is also possible that Congress chose not to include the substantial-effect requirement in this second exception because ""prior judicial interpretation"" of the identical phrases in the APA made such language unnecessary. Congress may have added a substantial-effect requirement to the third exception in order to settle some ambiguity in the cases interpreting the parallel provision of the APA, as described below. Finally, the CRA exempts ""any rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties."" The APA also excludes ""rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice"" from notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. Courts have held that this APA exception includes actions like agency decisions relating to how regulated entities must go about satisfying investigative requirements. Unlike the CRA, the APA does not explicitly limit this exception to those rules that do not ""substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties."" Nonetheless, because courts have read such a limitation into the APA exemption, the case law defining this requirement may be relevant to determine the scope of this CRA exemption. However, in the cases interpreting this parallel APA exclusion, the impact of a rule on a third party is not the only factor courts use to distinguish between substantive rules, which are required to go through notice-and-comment procedures, and procedural rules, which are not. Instead, courts have engaged in two kinds of inquiries. The first is the ""substantial impact test,"" which asks whether the agency action substantially impacts the regulated industry. However, the D.C. Circuit has noted that even rules best characterized as procedural measures may have a significant effect on regulated parties, and, accordingly, has held that ""a rule with a 'substantial impact' upon the persons subject to it is not necessarily a substantive rule."" Consequently, the D.C. Circuit has also asked whether the rule ""encodes a substantive value judgment."" Nonetheless, because the text of the CRA expressly excludes rules ""of agency organization, procedure, or practice"" that do not ""substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties,"" the CRA appears to mandate the use of something akin to the substantial impact test to determine whether a rule falls within this exception. In fact, one of the sponsors of the CRA emphasized prior to its passage that to determine whether a rule should be excluded under this provision, ""the focus ... is not on the type of rule but on its effect on the rights or obligations of nonagency parties."" He went on to say that the exclusion covered only rules ""with a truly minor, incidental effect on nonagency parties."" GAO has sometimes drawn on the APA case law described above in its own opinions analyzing whether various actions fall within the purview of the CRA. However, because the substantial-impact test and the substantive-value-judgment test were developed in the context of the APA to test whether rules ""implicate the policy interests animating notice-and-comment rulemaking,"" these judicially created tests might not be directly applicable to determine whether an agency statement is subject to the CRA. The CRA requires that agencies submit actions that fall within the CRA's definition of a rule to both houses of Congress and to GAO before the actions may take effect. Thus, the submission requirement applies generally to rules that are promulgated through APA notice-and-comment procedures, as well as to other types of agency statements, as discussed above. Specifically, Section 801(a)(1)(A) of the CRA requires the agency to submit a report containing a copy of the rule to each house of Congress and the Comptroller General; a concise general statement relating to the rule, including whether it is a major rule; and the proposed effective date of the rule. The agency is also required to submit additional information pertaining to any cost-benefit analysis the agency conducted, along with information on the agency's actions resulting from other regulatory impact analysis requirements, including the Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. For major rules, after receiving this information, GAO is then required to assess the agency's compliance with these additional informational requirements and include its assessment in the major rule report. The report is required to be submitted to the House and Senate committees of jurisdiction within 15 calendar days of the submission of the rule or its publication in the Federal Register , whichever date is later. The ""report"" that agencies are required to submit along with the rule, in practice, is a two-page form on which they provide the information required under Section 801(a)(1)(A) and, for major rules, most of the information required to be included in GAO's major rule report. In FY1999 appropriations legislation, Congress required the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to provide agencies with a standard form to use to meet this reporting requirement. OMB issued the form in March 1999 as part of a larger guidance to agencies on compliance with the CRA. A copy of the form is provided in Appendix A of this report. When final rules are submitted to Congress, notice of each chamber's receipt and referral appears in the respective House and Senate sections of the daily Congressional Record devoted to ""Executive Communications."" Notice of each chamber's receipt is also entered into a database that can be searched using Congress.gov. When the rule is submitted to GAO, a record of its receipt at GAO is noted in a database on GAO's website as well. Once the rule is received in Congress and published in the Federal Register , the time periods during which the CRA's expedited procedures are available begin, and Members can use the procedures to consider a resolution of disapproval. Thus, submission of rules to Congress under the CRA is critical because the receipt of the rule in Congress triggers the CRA's expedited procedures for introduction and consideration of a joint resolution disapproving the rule. In other words, if an agency fails to submit a rule to Congress, the House and Senate are unable to avail themselves of the special ""fast track"" procedures to consider a joint resolution striking down the rule. Following enactment of the CRA in 1996, some Members of Congress and others raised concerns over agencies not submitting their rules on several occasions. At a hearing on the CRA in 1997, one year after its enactment, witnesses noted that agencies were not in full compliance with the submission requirement. It was also noted at the hearing, however, that it appeared agencies were seeking ""in good faith"" to comply with the statute. At a hearing in 1998 on implementation of the CRA, GAO's general counsel testified that agencies were often not sending their rules to GAO or Congress. Also in 1998, to further improve agency compliance with the CRA, Congress required OMB to issue guidance on certain provisions of the CRA, specifically including the submission requirement in 5 U.S.C. §801(a)(1). To meet this requirement, then-OMB Director Jacob J. Lew issued a memorandum for agencies in March 1999. The Lew memorandum provided information such as where agencies should send their rules in the House and Senate, including the addresses of the Office of the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House, the offices in each chamber that receive the rules; what information the agencies should include with the rule; and an explanation of what types of rules are required to be submitted. Because agencies were initially inconsistent about fulfilling the submission requirement, GAO began to monitor agencies' compliance with the submission requirement by comparing the final rules that were published in the Federal Register with rules that were submitted to GAO. This was not a role that was required under the CRA; rather, GAO conducted these reviews voluntarily. As then-GAO general counsel Robert Murphy testified in 1998, GAO conducted a review to determine whether all final rules covered by the Congressional Review Act and published in the Register were filed with the Congress and the GAO. We performed this review both to verify the accuracy of our own data base and to ascertain the degree of agency compliance with the statute. We were concerned that regulated entities may have been led to believe that rules published in the Federal Register were effective, when, in fact, they were not unless filed in accordance with the statute. After its review of agency compliance with the submission requirement, in November 1997, GAO submitted to OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) a list of the rules that had been published in the Federal Register but had not been submitted to GAO. According to GAO, OIRA distributed this list to affected agencies; GAO then followed up again with the agencies that had rules that remained un-submitted in February 1998. GAO stated in its March 1998 testimony that ""In our view, OIRA should have played a more proactive role in assuring that the agencies were both aware of the statutory filing requirements and were complying with them."" GAO continued to conduct similar reviews regularly, comparing the list of rules that agencies submitted to GAO against rules that were published in the Federal Register . Until 2012, GAO periodically sent letters to OIRA regarding rules that it had not received. In March 2012, GAO notified OIRA that, due to constraints on its resources, it would no longer be sending lists of rules not received. Instead, GAO decided to continue to track only major rules not received, not all final rules, as they had previously done. In general, although there have been exceptions noted by GAO, agencies appear to be fairly comprehensive in submitting rules to Congress and GAO when those rules have been promulgated through an APA rulemaking process. GAO's federal rules database lists thousands of such rules each year. In the case of rules that are not subject to notice-and-comment procedures, however, agencies often do not fulfill the submission requirement, and tracking compliance for these types of agency actions is more difficult. Although GAO has voluntarily tracked agency compliance with the submission requirement, its methodology for doing so did not result in a complete list of agency actions that should have been submitted. GAO's point of reference was to compare regulations that were published in the Federal Register against regulations it received pursuant to the CRA. Most rules that are required to be published in the Federal Register are indeed subject to the CRA, making this a potentially helpful method of identifying rules that were not submitted. However, many of the other agency actions that are not subject to notice-and-comment requirements are not generally published in the Federal Registe r and are also not submitted to GAO. Therefore, using this method, many rules that should have been submitted likely were undetected by GAO and thus not included in the lists of un-submitted rules it sent to OIRA and to the agencies. It is precisely this issue that led to Members requesting GAO's opinion on individual agency actions that were of specific interest to them and were not submitted to Congress (nor, in most cases, published in the Federal Register ). The higher incidence of noncompliance with the CRA's submission requirement for agency actions that were conducted outside the notice-and-comment rulemaking process is likely due in large part to the practical difficulty of submitting the substantial number of agency statements that qualify as rules under the CRA. The CRA's submission requirement could potentially include a wide variety of items such as FAQs posted on agency websites, press releases, bulletins, information memoranda, and statements made by agency officials. In congressional testimony in 1997, one administrative law scholar argued that agencies ""annually take tens of thousands of actions"" that would fall under the CRA's definition of rule, and that Were agencies to comply fully with [the CRA's] requirement that all these matters be filed with Congress as a condition of their effectiveness (as it appears, thus far, they are not doing), Congress and the GAO would be swamped with filings. Burying Congress in paper might even seem a useful means of diverting attention from larger, controversial matters; haystacks can be useful for concealing needles. No one believes many, if any, of these rules will be the subjects of resolutions of disapproval. Yet for them even simple accompanying documents to permit data analysis and tracking, such as GAO has been proposing, would impose significant aggregate costs, well beyond their possible benefit. In addition, it seems possible that many agencies are unaware of the breadth of the CRA's coverage. Reading through various agencies' responses to the GAO opinions discussed below suggests that many agencies appear to be aware that notice-and-comment rules are generally covered by the CRA, but they may be unaware that many other types of actions are covered. For example, in an opinion it issued in 2012 regarding an action taken by the Department of Health and Human Services, GAO stated that ""We requested the views of the General Counsel of HHS on whether the July 12 Information Memorandum is a rule for purposes of the CRA by letter dated August 3, 2012. HHS responded on August 31, 2012, stating that the Information Memorandum was issued as a non-binding guidance document, and that HHS contends that guidance documents do not need to be submitted pursuant to the CRA."" GAO concluded, however, ""We cannot agree with HHS's conclusion that guidance documents are not rules for the purposes of the CRA and HHS cites no support for this position."" Because submission of rules is key to Congress's ability to use the CRA, if an agency does not submit a rule to Congress, this could potentially frustrate Congress's ability to review rules under the act. To avoid Congress being denied its opportunity for review of rules in this way, however, the Senate appears to have developed a practice that allows it to employ the CRA's review mechanism even when an agency does not submit a rule for review. That practice has involved seeking an opinion from GAO on whether an agency action should have been submitted under the CRA (i.e., whether the action is covered by the CRA's definition of ""rule""). In several instances since the enactment of the CRA in 1996, Members of Congress sought an opinion from GAO as to whether certain agency actions were covered by the CRA, despite the agency not having undertaken notice-and-comment rulemaking or having submitted the action to Congress. GAO has issued 21 opinions of this type as of March 5, 2019. In many of these opinions, GAO has defined the term ""rule"" as used in the CRA expansively. In 11 of the 21 opinions, GAO opined that the agency statement in question was a rule under the CRA that should have been submitted to the House and Senate for review. These opinions are summarized below in this report and are listed in a table in Appendix B . In recent years, the Senate has considered publication in the Congressional Record of a GAO opinion classifying an agency action as a rule as the trigger date for the initiation period to submit a disapproval resolution and for the action period during which such a joint resolution qualifies for expedited consideration in the Senate. Thus, the question of whether Congress may use the CRA's expedited parliamentary disapproval mechanism generally hinges upon the nature of GAO's opinion in such cases. By allowing the GAO opinion to serve as a substitute for the actual submission of a rule, the Senate can still avail itself of the CRA's expedited procedures to overturn rules. In responding to these requests from Members for opinions on whether certain agency actions are covered, GAO has played an important role in determining the applicability of the CRA, although the specific role that GAO has played in this regard is not explicitly outlined in the statute. But a review of the history of the early implementation of the CRA, and a consideration of GAO's other activities under the CRA, suggests that the role GAO currently plays with regard to determining whether a specific agency action is a ""rule"" is linked to other activities GAO has engaged in regarding the CRA. As has been noted, GAO's primary statutory requirement under the CRA is to provide a report to the committees of jurisdiction on each major rule, and to include in the report information about the agency's compliance with various steps of the rulemaking process for each major rule. For non-major rules, soon after the CRA was enacted, GAO voluntarily created an online database of rules submitted to it under the CRA, suggesting that it was willing to go beyond what was required of it by the statute to facilitate implementation. As GAO's general counsel explained in congressional testimony in 1998, ""Although the law is silent as to GAO's role relating to the nonmajor rules, we believe that basic information about the rules should be collected in a manner that can be of use to Congress and the public. To do this, we have established a database that gathers basic information about the 15-20 rules we receive on the average each day."" The database can be used to search for rules by elements such as the title, issuing agency, date of publication, type of rule (major or non-major), and effective date. The website also contains links to each of GAO's major rule reports. Perhaps most notably, however, GAO's determination of whether agency actions are considered ""rules"" under the CRA appears to be closely linked to its monitoring of agency compliance with the submission requirement as discussed above. The question of whether an agency action is a rule under the CRA is also a question of whether it should be submitted; arguably, then, GAO is addressing a very similar question in its opinions on whether certain agency actions are covered as it was in its initial reports to OIRA on agency compliance with the submission requirement. A discussion of GAO's role in a congressional hearing on the Tongass Land Management Plan in 1997 provides some evidence of the voluntary and, initially, ad hoc nature of GAO's role in this regard. One of the issues that was addressed at the hearing was whether the plan should be considered a rule under the CRA; GAO's general counsel was invited to testify at the hearing. Six days before the hearing, GAO issued its second opinion on the applicability of the CRA, in which it stated that the Tongass Land Management Plan should have been submitted as a rule under the CRA. Former Senator Larry Craig, who had requested the opinion, asked GAO's general counsel at the hearing about GAO's role: It is our understanding of your testimony and our own reading of the Regulatory Flexibility Act that the General Accounting Office has been given the role of advising Congress and perhaps agencies on whether their policy decisions constitute rules. It is our understanding that the GAO's independent opinion is generally given considerable weight by the agencies. Is this also the GAO's understanding of its role? In response, GAO's general counsel, Robert Murphy, stated that the CRA does not provide any identification of who is to decide what a rule is, unlike the issue of whether a rule is a major rule or not, which, as [OIRA Administrator] Ms. Katzen pointed out, has been assigned to her. So in that sense, I cannot say that GAO has a special role under the statute for making that determination. The decision, the opinion, that we issued last week on the question [of whether the Tongass Land Management Plan was a rule under the CRA] was done in our role as adviser to the Congress in response to the request of three chairmen of congressional committees. Thus, GAO acknowledged that its opinion was provided not pursuant to any specific provision of the statute, but in a more general, advisory capacity. In the years following, Members continued to request GAO opinions advising Congress on the matter of whether an agency action should have been submitted. Although GAO has issued 21 opinions on the applicability of the CRA since 1996, Congress's response to those opinions has varied over time. Initially, the GAO opinions finding that the agency actions in question were rules under the CRA did not lead to the introduction of joint resolutions of disapproval—Members appear not to have introduced any joint resolutions of disapproval following a GAO opinion until 2008. In 2008, GAO issued an opinion stating that a letter from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to state health officials concerning the State Children's Health Insurance Program was a rule for the purposes of the CRA; in response, Senator John D. Rockefeller introduced S.J.Res. 44 to disapprove the guidance provided in the letter. According to a press release from the Committee on Finance at the time, however, the committee did not take further action on the resolution of disapproval because it had missed the window during which the action would have been required to be taken under the CRA to use its expedited procedures. The first time either chamber took action on a resolution of disapproval introduced following a GAO opinion was in 2012, when the House passed H.J.Res. 118 (112 th Congress), a resolution of disapproval that would have overturned an information memorandum issued by the Department of Health and Human Services relating to the implementation of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. The first time the Senate took action on such a resolution of disapproval was on April 18, 2018, when it passed S.J.Res. 57 , overturning guidance from the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB) pertaining to indirect auto lending and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. The House passed S.J.Res. 57 on May 8, 2018, and the President signed it into law on May 21, 2018. Standing alone, a GAO opinion deciding whether an agency action is a ""rule"" covered by the CRA does not have legal effect. As discussed, GAO's role in determining whether actions are subject to the CRA is not provided for in the CRA, and its opinions are, in essence, advisory. The opinions do not have any immediate effect other than advising Congress as to whether GAO considers an agency action to meet the definition of ""rule"" under the CRA. As a matter of course, however, it appears that the Senate has chosen to treat the GAO opinions as dispositive on the issue. In several cases, individual Senators have stated that once a GAO opinion determining that an agency action is a rule is published in the Congressional Record , the time periods under the CRA commence and the agency action in question becomes subject to the CRA disapproval mechanism. The enactment in May 2018 of a joint resolution of disapproval that was introduced following a GAO opinion regarding a 2013 CFPB bulletin that had not been submitted by the agency further indicates that Congress, in at least some cases, is willing to consider the GAO opinion as a substitute for the agency's submission of a rule to Congress. GAO described this practice in November 2018 in one of its opinions relating to the applicability of the CRA: ""Congress has opted to treat the receipt of a GAO opinion concluding that an agency action is a rule as triggering the statutory provisions that otherwise would have been triggered by the agency's submission. Thus, Congress has used GAO opinions to cure the impediment created by the agency's failure to submit the rule, protecting its review and oversight authorities."" In sum, GAO opinions facilitate congressional review of rules that were not—but should have been—submitted under the CRA. A CRA provision barring judicial review makes it unlikely that a GAO opinion or any other congressional determination stating that a rule is subject to the CRA would be subject to challenge in court. This provision states that ""[n]o determination, finding, action, or omission under this chapter shall be subject to judicial review."" Accordingly, most courts have refused to review any claims arguing that an agency action should have been submitted to Congress as a rule under the CRA. As a result, the question of whether an agency action is subject to the CRA and its fast-track procedures will likely be settled in the political arena rather than in the courts, and, if Congress continues to treat GAO opinions as determinative, those opinions likely will be the final word on the issue. The provision barring judicial review may mean that one other critical aspect of the CRA may be addressed outside of the courts and through GAO opinions: whether a rule has taken effect. As discussed previously, the CRA states that agencies must submit covered rules to Congress and the Comptroller General ""before a rule can take effect,"" suggesting that a rule may not become operative until the report required by the CRA is submitted to Congress. Indeed, the post-enactment statement inserted into the Congressional Record by the CRA's sponsors stated that, barring two exceptions listed in the CRA, ""any covered rule not submitted to Congress and the Comptroller General will … not [take] effect until it is submitted pursuant to subsection 801(a)(1)(A)."" However, courts have refused to adjudicate claims arguing that various rules are not in effect because an agency has failed to submit the rules to Congress. Accordingly, it is unlikely that a court would be willing to enforce this provision and declare that a rule lacks effect because it was not submitted to Congress. If an agency has not submitted a disputed action to Congress, it is possible that this inaction was the result of the agency's view that the rule was not subject to the CRA. A GAO opinion stating that an agency action does constitute a rule, while not itself rendering a rule ineffective, may be the first indication to the agency that the rule did not ""take effect"" because the agency did not fulfill the CRA submission requirement. But in the context of agency rules that inherently lack legal effect, the determination that they lack ""effect"" under the CRA may not have much practical impact. In the context of rulemaking, to ""take effect"" usually means that something has become legally effective. As noted, however, the CRA encompasses some non-legislative rules that inherently lack legal effect. The fact that the CRA requires agencies to submit some agency statements that lack legal effect suggests that the term ""effect,"" as used in the CRA's submission requirement, means something other than legal effect. While reviewing notice-and-comment rulemakings, some courts have held that the CRA suspends a rule's operation notwithstanding the fact that a rule may technically have become effective. With respect to rules such as general policy statements that generally lack legal force, however, even if an agency failed to comply with the CRA's submission requirement and erroneously regarded the rule as being operative, it is less likely that the operation of the statement had a discernible and independent effect on the agency's actions. This section briefly summarizes each of the 21 GAO opinions to date on whether certain agency actions were rules and, thus, eligible for disapproval under the CRA. When GAO appeared to consider one or more of the CRA exceptions to the definition of ""rule"" as fundamental to its analysis, the summaries identify which exception GAO focused on in its opinion. The opinions are listed in chronological order by the date on which GAO issued the opinion. For a more concise summary of each of these opinions, see the table in Appendix B . The Emergency Sale Timber Program was enacted as part of the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations and Rescissions Act of 1995. The program was intended to ""increase the sales of salvage timber in order to remove diseased and damaged trees and improve the health and ecosystems of federally owned forests."" On July 2, 1996, the Secretary of Agriculture sent a memorandum entitled ""Revised Direction for Emergency Timber Salvage Sales Conducted Under Section 2001(b) of P.L. 104-19 "" to the Chief of the Forest Service, containing ""clarifications in policy"" for the program. GAO concluded that the memorandum was a rule under the CRA because some of its contents ""clearly are of general applicability and future effect in interpreting section 2001 of P.L. 104-19 "" and because, contrary to the argument the Department of Agriculture made to GAO when GAO requested its views on the matter, the memorandum ""does not fall within the agency procedure or practice exclusion [in 5 U.S.C. §804(3)(C)]."" On May 23, 2007, the Department of Agriculture's Forest Service issued the Tongass National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan, which ""sets forth the management direction for the Tongass Forest and the desired condition of the Forest to be attained through Forest-wide multiple-use goals and objectives."" GAO concluded that the plan was a rule under the CRA and was not excepted under 5 U.S.C. §804(3) because ""decisions made in the Plan substantially affect non-agency parties and are, therefore, not 'agency procedures.'"" President William Clinton signed Executive Order 13061 on September 11, 1997, announcing policies related to the American Heritage River Initiative (AHRI). The AHRI was intended to support American communities' efforts to restore and protect their rivers; the President was to designate, by proclamation, 10 rivers that would take part in the program. GAO concluded that Executive Order 13061 was not a rule under the CRA because the President is not an ""agency"" for the purposes of the CRA (or, for that matter, under the APA). As such, actions taken by the President are not subject to the CRA. On February 5, 1998, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued its ""Interim Guidance for Investigating Title VI Administrative Complaints Challenging Permits."" According to EPA, the intent of the guidance was to update EPA's procedural and policy framework regarding complaints alleging discrimination in the environmental permitting context. GAO concluded that ""considered as a whole, the Interim Guidance clearly affects the rights of non-agency parties"" and thus was a rule under the CRA and not exempt under 5 U.S.C. §804(3). On May 3, 2000, the Farm Credit Administration (FCA) issued a booklet entitled ""National Charters,"" and then the FCA published the booklet in the Federal Register on July 20, 2000. The booklet ""provide[d] guidance on the national charter application process and the national charter territory. Specifically, the Booklet explain[ed] how a direct lender association can apply for a national charter; what the territory of a national charter will be; and what conditions the FCA will impose in connection with granting a national charter."" GAO concluded that ""we find that the Booklet, while labeled a statement of policy by the FCA, in actuality, meets the requirements of a legislative rule—which should have been issued using informal rulemaking procedures, including notice and comment."" GAO then concluded that the booklet constituted a rule under the CRA and was not exempt under 5 U.S.C. §804(3) because the policies established in the booklet would have an effect on non-agency parties, and because statements made within the booklet clearly indicate that ""the FCA recognizes the effect of the Booklet and national charters on other parties."" The Trinity River Record of Decision (ROD) was issued in December 2000 and documented the Department of the Interior's selection of the actions that it deemed necessary to ""restore and maintain the anadromous fish in the Trinity River."" The ROD identified the department's selected courses of action for addressing the decreased river flows in the Trinity River Basin. GAO concluded that the ROD was a ""rule"" under the CRA because ""its essential purpose is to set policy for the future,"" it was not a rule of agency procedure or practice under 5 U.S.C. §804(3), and ""it will have broad effect on both rivers' ecosystems and potentially significant economic effect within the Sacramento and Trinity River basins."" On July 18, 2002, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) issued a memorandum to network directors regarding the VA's marketing activities to enroll new veterans in the VA health care system. Specifically, the memorandum directed the network directors to no longer engage in trying to enroll new veterans through the use of certain types of activities, such as health fairs, veteran open houses, and enrollment displays at VSO meetings. GAO concluded that the memorandum was not a rule under the CRA because it ""is clearly excluded from the coverage of the CRA by one of the enumerated exceptions found in 5 U.S.C. §804(3)""—specifically, GAO considered the memorandum to be a statement of agency procedure or practice that did not affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties. Rather, the memorandum governed internal agency procedures and did not affect the ability of veterans to enroll in the VA health care system. On January 23, 2003, the VA issued a memorandum terminating the Vendee Loan Program, a program that allowed the VA to make loans for the sale of foreclosed VA-loan-guaranteed property. In the memorandum, which was addressed to all directors and loan guarantee officers, the VA Secretary announced that it would no longer finance the sale of acquired properties. GAO concluded that the memorandum was not a rule under the CRA because it was a rule relating to agency management (i.e., excepted under 5 U.S.C. §804(3)(B)) or a rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties (i.e., excepted under 5 U.S.C. §804(3)(C)). GAO noted that ""this is the type of management decision left to the discretion of the Secretary of VA in order to maintain the effective functioning and long-term stability of the program,"" and that ""since the vendee loans were a purely discretionary method for VA to use to dispose of foreclosed properties, the change in the agency's 'organization' or 'practice' does not affect any party's right or obligation."" On August 17, 2007, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued a letter to state health officials concerning the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). The letter ""purports to clarify the statutory and regulatory requirements concerning prevention of crowd out for states wishing to provide SCHIP coverage to children with effective family incomes in excess of 250 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) and identifies a number of particular measures that these states should adopt."" GAO concluded that the letter was a rule for the purposes of the CRA because it was a ""statement of general applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy with regard to the SCHIP program,"" and because GAO did ""not believe that the August 17 letter comes within any of the exceptions to the definition of rule contained in the Review Act."" On July 12, 2012, the Department of Health and Human Services' Administration for Children and Families issued an information memorandum concerning the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. The memorandum notified states that HHS was willing to exercise waiver authority over some of the program's work requirements. GAO concluded that the information memorandum was a rule for the purposes of the CRA because it was a ""statement of general applicability and future effect, designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy with regard to TANF,"" and it did not fall within any of the three exceptions to the definition of a rule. As GAO stated, the memorandum applied to states and therefore was of general applicability, rather than particular applicability; it applied to the states and not agency management or personnel; and it established ""the criteria by which states may apply for waivers from certain requirements of the TANF program. These criteria affect the obligations of the states, which are non-agency parties."" On January 8, 2014, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a proposed rule entitled ""Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from New Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units."" The proposed rule was intended to establish ""standards for fossil fuel-fired electric steam generating units (utility boilers and Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) units) and for natural gas-fired stationary combustion turbines."" GAO concluded that the proposed rule in question was not an action that was covered by the CRA, because the CRA was intended to apply only to final rules: ""The issuance of a proposed rule is an interim step in the rulemaking process intended to satisfy APA's notice requirement, and, as such, is not a triggering event for CRA purposes."" Furthermore, GAO stated ""the precedent provided in our prior opinions underscores that proposed rules are not rules for CRA purposes, and GAO has no role with respect to them."" On March 22, 2013, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, issued interagency guidance on leveraged lending. The guidance ""outline[d] for agency-supervised institutions high-level principles related to safe-and-sound leveraged lending activities, including underwriting considerations, assessing and documenting enterprise value, risk management expectations for credits awaiting distribution, stress-testing expectations, pipeline portfolio management, and risk management expectations for exposures held by the institution."" GAO concluded that the leveraged-lending guidance was a rule under the CRA because it was a general statement of policy that had future effect and because GAO could ""readily conclude that the guidance does not fall within any of the three exceptions in the CRA."" GAO's opinion, which was issued on October 19, 2017, was silent on the matter of the timing of its opinion relative to the guidance, which was issued in 2013. On December 9, 2016, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service approved an amendment to the Tongass Land and Resource Management Plan. The plan identified the uses that may occur in each area of the forest. The Forest Service is required under the National Forest Management Act of 1976 to update forest plans at least every 15 years and potentially more frequently. GAO concluded that the amendment to the plan was a rule under the CRA because the amendment ""has a substantial impact on the regulated community such that it is a substantive rather than a procedural rule for purposes of CRA."" As such, the plan could not be considered to fall within the exception in 5 U.S.C. §804(3)(C), despite the argument presented by USDA when GAO asked the agency its views on the matter. On December 30, 2016, the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management issued its resource management plan for four areas in Alaska: the Draanjik Planning Area, the Fortymile Planning Area, the Steese Planning Area, and the White Mountains Planning Area. Land management plans such as these are intended to provide specific information for the use of public lands and are required under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. GAO concluded that the plan was a rule under the CRA because it was of general applicability, had future effect, and was designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy, and because it did not fit into any of the three exceptions. Of particular relevance appeared to be the exception in 5 U.S.C. §804(3)(C): ""Because the Eastern Interior Plan designates uses by nonagency parties that may take place in the four areas it governs, it is not a rule of agency organization, procedure or practice."" On March 21, 2013, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a bulletin on ""Indirect Auto Lending and Compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act."" The bulletin ""provide[d] guidance about indirect auto lenders' compliance with the fair lending requirements of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and its implementing regulation, Regulation B."" GAO concluded that the bulletin was a rule under the CRA because it ""is a statement of general applicability, since it applies to all indirect auto lenders; it has future effect; and it is designed to prescribe the Bureau's policy in enforcing fair lending laws,"" and because the bulletin ""does not fall within any of the [CRA's] exceptions."" GAO's opinion, which was issued on October 19, 2017, was silent on the matter of the timing of its opinion relative to the bulletin, which was issued in 2013. On January 23, 2017, President Donald J. Trump released a presidential memorandum establishing his Administration's policy on global health assistance funding, often referred to as the ""Mexico City Policy."" The policy prohibited assistance to foreign nongovernmental organizations and other entities that perform or promote abortion as a method of family planning. To implement this policy, the Department of State issued a fact sheet entitled ""Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance"" on May 15, 2017, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) issued revisions to its ""Standard Provisions for U.S. Nongovernmental Organizations"" on March 2, 2017. GAO concluded that the two agency actions in question were not rules for the purposes of the CRA because, although the fact sheets were issued by federal agencies, they were merely implementing a decision of the President, under a statute that specifically granted broad policymaking authority to the President. GAO based this decision on a 1989 D.C. Circuit case, DKT Memorial Fund v. Agency for International Development , which held that agency actions implementing the decision of President Ronald Reagan to establish the Mexico City Policy were not reviewable under the APA. The court held that the disputed decision involved ""not a rulemaking by an agency, but rather a policy-making at the highest level by the executive branch,"" concluding that it did not have authority under the APA ""to review the wisdom of policy decisions of the President"" where the relevant statute granted the President broad discretion in the area of foreign affairs. GAO determined that in accordance with this precedent, the agency actions implementing President Trump's policy decision were not subject to the CRA. In guidance for the 2018 tax filing season, IRS announced on its website that it ""would not accept electronically filed individual income tax returns where the taxpayer does not meet ACA reporting requirements, specifically to report full-year health coverage, claim a coverage exemption, or report a shared responsibility payment (known as 'silent returns')."" GAO concluded that the agency statement was not a rule under the CRA because it ""is a rule of agency procedure or practice that does not substantially affect taxpayers' rights or obligations,"" thus falling into the exception in 5 U.S.C. §804(3)(C). In effect, according to GAO, the ""statement changes the timing of IRS compliance measures, but it does not change IRS's basis for assessing taxpayers' compliance with existing law—namely, the requirement to file a complete tax return and to meet ACA reporting requirements."" The Social Security Administration's (SSA) Hearings, Appeals, and Litigation Law Manual (HALLEX) describes how SSA will process and adjudicate claims for disability benefits under the Social Security Act. Two sections of the manual stated a policy under which an SSA adjudicator could not rely on information from the Internet, including from social media networks, in deciding a claim for benefits (with two exceptions). GAO concluded that these two sections of HALLEX were not rules under the CRA because they were merely ""procedures that govern the use of evidence from the Internet during those proceedings"" and they ""do not impose new burdens on claimants or alter claimants' rights or obligations during the SSA appeal process."" Thus, GAO concluded that ""the HALLEX sections are procedural rules that meet the [5 U.S.C. §804(3)(C)] exception."" On July 26, 2018, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2018-38, which ""modifies the information certain tax-exempt entities are required to report to IRS on their annual returns."" On July 30, 2018, the IRS submitted Revenue Procedure 2018-38 to Congress under the CRA. On September 7, 2018, then-Senator Orrin Hatch submitted a request to GAO seeking its opinion on whether the revenue procedure was covered by the CRA's definition of ""rule."" The IRS had apparently made the determination, despite having submitted the document under the CRA, that the document was not covered by the CRA. Rather, the IRS argued that it had submitted the rule ""out of an abundance of caution"" and to ""allow Congress to decide whether it is a rule by consulting GAO."" The circumstances surrounding this GAO opinion were somewhat unique, because the IRS had already submitted the revenue procedure to Congress under the CRA by the time the question was raised as to whether the revenue procedure was covered by the definition of ""rule."" This appeared to be the first time that GAO had considered the application of the CRA when an agency submitted a rule and later made the argument that the rule was not covered. In its opinion, GAO primarily addressed the issue of whether the submission of the rule was sufficient to trigger the CRA's timelines rather than whether the revenue procedure met the statutory definition of ""rule."" GAO stated in its opinion that the purpose of the GAO opinions is ""to cure the impediment created by the agency's failure to submit the rule, protecting [Congress's] review and oversight authorities,"" and, therefore, because the IRS had already submitted the rule, a GAO opinion on the CRA's applicability would be unnecessary. Furthermore, GAO confirmed that the IRS revenue procedure was available for congressional review under the CRA because the IRS had already submitted it: ""IRS's submission triggered Congress's review and oversight powers under CRA, starting with the transmittal of the rule to the committees of jurisdiction."" GAO also stated, ""As Congress is not deprived of exercising its powers under CRA, there is no impediment to those powers that a GAO opinion might cure. We, therefore, take no position on whether the revenue procedure is a rule otherwise."" On April 6, 2018, the Attorney General issued a memorandum directing federal prosecutors to adopt a zero-tolerance policy for illegal border crossings at the southwestern border of the United States. GAO concluded that the April 2018 memorandum was not a rule under the CRA because it was a rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice, and it did not change individuals' rights or obligations: ""The rights and obligations in question are prescribed by existing immigration laws and remain unchanged by the agency's internal enforcement procedures at issue here."" Thus, GAO concluded that the memorandum was covered by the exception in 5 U.S.C. §804(3)(C). In March 2018, the Secretary of Commerce issued a memorandum to the Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs justifying the Secretary's decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. According to GAO, the memorandum ""described a December 12, 2017 request from the Department of Justice (DOJ) that the Census Bureau include a citizenship question on the 2020 census"" and directed the Under Secretary to include such a question. Soon after the Secretary issued the memorandum, pursuant to statutory requirements, the Census Bureau delivered a report to Congress containing its planned questions for the 2020 census, including the citizenship question. GAO concluded that the memorandum was not a rule under the CRA, stating that ""it was direction from a supervisor to a subordinate in conjunction with the statutory process whereby the Secretary informs Congress of the questions that will be on the census.… As such, the memorandum does not meet CRA's definition of a rule because it was not designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy."" Because the memorandum did not meet the definition of ""rule"" under section 551 of the APA, GAO did not discuss whether the memorandum would have been covered by any of the exceptions. Appendix A. Submission Form for Rules Under the CRA Appendix B. Summary of GAO Opinions\n\n","['The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to review certain types of federal agency actions that fall under the statutory category of ""rules."" The CRA requires that agencies report their rules to Congress and provides special procedures under which Congress can consider legislation to overturn those rules. A joint resolution of disapproval will become effective once both houses of Congress pass a joint resolution and it is signed by the President, or if Congress overrides the President\'s veto. The CRA generally adopts a broad definition of the word ""rule"" from the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), defining a rule as ""the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency."" The CRA, however, provides three exceptions to this broad definition: any rule of particular applicability, including a rule that approves or prescribes for the future rates, wages, prices, services, or allowances therefor, corporate or financial structures, reorganizations, mergers, or acquisitions thereof, or accounting practices or disclosures bearing on any of the foregoing; any rule relating to agency management or personnel; or any rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties. The class of rules the CRA covers is broader than the category of rules that are subject to the APA\'s notice-and-comment requirements. As such, some agency actions, such as guidance documents, that are not subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures may still be considered rules under the CRA and thus could be overturned using the CRA\'s procedures. The effect of Congress disapproving a rule that is not subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking may be subject to debate, given that such rules are generally viewed to lack any legal effect in the first place. Nonetheless, the CRA does encompass some such rules, as highlighted by the recent enactment of a CRA resolution overturning a bulletin from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that was not subject to the notice-and-comment procedures. Even if an agency action falls under the CRA\'s definition of ""rule,"" however, the expedited procedures for considering legislation to overturn the rule only become available when the agency submits the rule to Congress. In many cases in which agencies take actions that fall under the scope of a ""rule"" but have not gone through notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures, agencies fail to submit those rules. Thus, questions have arisen as to how Members can avail themselves of the CRA\'s special fast-track procedures if the agency has not submitted the action to Congress. To protect its prerogative to review agency rules under the CRA, Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) have developed an ad hoc process in which Members can request that GAO provide a formal legal opinion on whether a particular agency action qualifies as a rule under the CRA. If GAO concludes that the action in question falls within the CRA\'s definition of ""rule,"" Congress has treated the publication of the GAO opinion in the Congressional Record as constructive submission of the rule. In other words, an affirmative opinion from GAO can allow Congress to use the CRA procedures to consider legislation overturning an agency action despite the agency not submitting that action to Congress.']","12318","gov_report","en","None","64783ddf48e7a912be7c5d5b7e10f3ac6cad81444d8aff62","Summary:","gov_report","532","\nThe Congressional"
"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nGeographic shifts in the veterans’ population, changes in health care delivery, an aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement affect VA’s efforts to align its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. For example, there has been a shift over time from inpatient to outpatient care. This shift will likely result in underutilized space once used for inpatient care. In such instances, it is often difficult and costly for VA to modernize, renovate, and retrofit these older facilities. In June 2017, VA reported that its facility inventory includes 430 vacant or mostly vacant buildings that are, on average, more than 60 years old, and an additional 784 buildings that are underutilized. The historic status of some VA facilities adds to the complexity of converting or disposing of them. In 2014, VA reported holding 2,957 historic buildings, structures, or land parcels—the third most in the federal government after DOD and the Department of the Interior. In some instances, it may be more expensive to renovate than to demolish and rebuild outdated facilities. In other cases, however, there may not be an option to demolish if these buildings are designated as historic. For example, planning officials at four medical facilities in our review told us that state historic preservation efforts prevented the VA from demolishing vacant buildings, even though these buildings require upkeep costs and pose potential safety hazards. (See fig. 1.) VA has also encountered challenges to its facility alignment efforts, in part, because it has not consistently followed best practices for effectively engaging stakeholders. VA may align its facilities to meet veterans’ needs by expanding or consolidating facilities or services. Stakeholders— including veterans; local, state, and federal officials; Veterans Service Organizations; historic preservation groups; VA staff; and Congress— often view changes as working against their interests or those of their constituents, especially when services are eliminated or shifted from one location to another. We found that VA has not consistently engaged with stakeholders, and, in some cases, this inconsistency resulted in adversarial relationships that reduced VA’s ability to better align facilities with the needs of the veteran population. In our April 2017 report, we recommended that VA improve stakeholder communication guidance and evaluate its efforts. VA agreed with our recommendations and outlined a plan to implement them. Two of the planning processes VA uses to align its facilities—VA’s Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and the VA Integrated Planning (VAIP)—have limitations. VA relies on the SCIP process to plan and prioritize capital projects system-wide, but SCIP’s limitations—including subjective narratives, long timeframes, and restricted access to information—undermine VA’s ability to achieve its goals. For example, the time between when planning officials at VA medical facilities begin developing the SCIP narratives and when they are notified that a project is funded has taken between 17 and 23 months over the past 6 fiscal-year’s SCIP submissions. (See fig. 2.) As such, VA routinely asks its facility planners to submit their next year’s planned project narratives before knowing if their project submissions from the previous year have been funded. An official from the office that oversees SCIP told us that the timing of the budgeting process, which is outside VA’s control, contributes to these delays. While these aspects are outside of VA’s control, VA has chosen to wait about 6 to 10 months to report the results of the SCIP scoring process to the medical facilities. This situation makes it difficult for local officials to understand the likelihood that their projects will receive funding. A VA official said that for future SCIP cycles, VA plans to release the scoring results for minor construction and non-recurring maintenance projects to local officials earlier in the process. At the time of our review, however, the official did not have a time frame for when VA would do this. Although VA acknowledges many of these limitations, it has taken little action in response. Federal standards for internal control state that agencies should evaluate and determine appropriate corrective action for identified limitations on a timely basis. If VA does not address known limitations with the SCIP process, it will not have reasonable assurance that SCIP can be used to accurately identify the capital necessary to address VA’s service and infrastructure gaps. In our April 2017 report, we recommended that VA address identified limitations to the SCIP process, including limitations to scoring and approval, and access to information. VA concurred with the recommendation to the extent the limitations were within its control. While VA has taken some actions, the recommendation remains open. The VAIP process produces a market-level health services delivery plan for each Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) and a facility master plan for each medical facility. VA has estimated the entire process to create plans for VISNs and facilities to cost $108 million when fully complete. However, the VAIP process’s facility master plans assume all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities. This assumption is not accurate given that (1) VA obligated about $10.1 billion to purchase care from non-VA providers in fiscal year 2015 and (2) VA can provide care directly through its medical facilities or purchase health care services from non-VA providers through both the Non-VA Medical Care Program (referred to as “care in the community” by VA) and clinical contracts. The Office of Management and Budget’s acquisition guidance notes that investments in major capital assets should be made only if no alternative private sector source can support the function at a lower cost. In our April 2017 report, we recommended that VA assess the value of the VAIP’s facility master plans as a facility-planning tool, and based on conclusions from the review, to either (1) discontinue the development of VAIP’s facility master plans or (2) address the limitations of VAIP’s facility master plans. VA concurred with the recommendation, and in August 2017, VA noted that it has discontinued its VAIP facility master plans while VA pursues a national realignment strategy, after which it plans to adjust its future facility master plans to incorporate pertinent information, including care in the community realignment opportunities. As Congress evaluates proposed legislation for disposing of or realigning VA property, it may wish to consider seven elements DOD relied on as it developed its recommendations for the BRAC Commission. Establish goals for the process. The Secretary of Defense emphasized the importance of transforming the military to make it more efficient as part of the 2005 BRAC round. Other goals for the 2005 BRAC process included fostering jointness among the four military services, reducing excess infrastructure, and producing savings. Prior rounds focused more on reducing excess infrastructure and producing savings. Develop criteria for evaluating closures and realignments. DOD proposed selection criteria, which were made available for public comment via the Federal Register. Ultimately, Congress enacted the final BRAC selection criteria in law with minor modification and specified that four selection criteria, known as the “military value criteria,” were to be given priority in developing closure and realignment recommendations. Further, Congress required that the Secretary of Defense develop and submit to Congress a force structure plan that described the estimated size of major military units needed to address probable threats to national security for the 20- year period beginning in 2005, along with a comprehensive inventory of global military installations. In authorizing the 2005 BRAC round, Congress specified that the Secretary of Defense publish a list of recommendations for the closure and realignment of military installations inside the United States based on the statutorily-required 20-year force structure plan and infrastructure inventory, and on the final selection criteria. Estimate costs and savings to implement closure and realignment recommendations. To address the cost and savings criteria, DOD developed and used the Cost of Base Realignment Actions (COBRA) model, a quantitative tool that DOD has used since the 1988 BRAC round to provide consistency in potential cost, savings, and return-on-investment estimates for closure and realignment options. We found the COBRA model to be a generally reasonable estimator for comparing potential costs and savings among alternatives. (See fig. 3.) As with any model, the quality of the output from COBRA was a direct function of the data DOD included in the model. Also, DOD’s COBRA model relied to a large extent on standard factors and averages and did not represent budget quality estimates that were developed once BRAC decisions were made and detailed implementation plans were developed. Nonetheless, the financial information provided important input into the selection process as decision makers weighed the financial implications—along with military value criteria and other considerations—in arriving at final decisions about the suitability of various closure and realignment options. Establish an organizational structure. The Office of the Secretary of Defense emphasized the need for joint cross-service groups to analyze common business-oriented functions. For the 2005 BRAC round, as for the 1993 and 1995 rounds, these joint cross-service groups performed analyses and developed closure and realignment options in addition to those developed by the military departments. Our evaluation of DOD’s 1995 BRAC round found that few cross- service recommendations were made, in part because of the lack of high-level leadership to encourage consolidations across the departments’ functions. In the 1995 BRAC round, the joint cross- service groups submitted options through the military services for approval, but few were approved. The number of approved recommendations that the joint cross-service groups developed significantly increased in the 2005 BRAC round. This increase was, in part, because high-level leadership ensured that the options were approved not by the military departments but rather by a DOD senior- level group, known as the Infrastructure Steering Group. As shown in figure 4, the Infrastructure Steering Group was placed organizationally on par with the military departments. Establish a common analytical framework. To ensure that the selection criteria were consistently applied, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the military departments, and the seven joint cross- service groups first performed a capacity analysis of facilities and functions. Before developing the candidate recommendations, DOD’s capacity analysis relied on data calls to hundreds of locations to obtain certified data to assess such factors as maximum potential capacity, current capacity, current usage, and excess capacity. Then, the military departments and joint cross-service groups performed a military value analysis for the facilities and functions based on primary military value criteria, which included a facility’s or function’s current and future mission capabilities, physical condition, ability to accommodate future needs, and cost of operations. Develop BRAC oversight mechanisms to improve accountability for implementation. In the 2005 BRAC round, the Office of the Secretary of Defense for the first time required the military departments to develop business plans to better inform the Office of the Secretary of Defense of the status of implementation and financial details for each of the BRAC 2005 recommendations. These business plans included: (1) information such as a listing of all actions needed to implement each recommendation; (2) schedules for personnel relocations between installations; and (3) updated cost and savings estimates by DOD based on current information. This approach permitted senior-level intervention if warranted to ensure completion of the BRAC recommendations by the statutory completion date. Involve the audit community to better ensure data accuracy. The DOD Inspector General and military department audit agencies played key roles in identifying data limitations, pointing out needed corrections, and improving the accuracy of the data used in the process. In their oversight roles, the audit organizations, which had access to relevant information and officials as the process evolved, helped to improve the accuracy of the data used in the BRAC process and thus strengthened the quality and integrity of the data used to develop closure and realignment recommendations. For example, the auditors worked to ensure certified information was used for BRAC analysis and reviewed other facets of the process, including the various internal control plans, the COBRA model, and other modeling and analytical tools that were used in the development of recommendations. We identified two key challenges that affected DOD’s implementation of BRAC 2005 and would need to be addressed for VA to adopt a BRAC- like process for its asset and infrastructure review. Some transformational-type BRAC recommendations required sustained senior leadership attention and a high level of coordination among many stakeholders to complete by the required date. Implementation of some transformational BRAC recommendations—especially those where a multitude of organizations had roles to play to ensure the achievement of the goals of the recommendation—illustrated the need to involve key stakeholders and effective planning. For example, the Defense Logistics Agency committed sustained high-level leadership and included relevant stakeholders to address implementation challenges faced with the potential for disruptions to depot operations during implementation of the BRAC consolidation recommendation. To implement the BRAC recommendations, the agency had to develop strategic agreements with the services that ensured that all stakeholders agreed on its plans for implementation, and had to address certain human capital and information technology challenges. Large number of actions and interdependent recommendations complicated the implementation process. The large number and variety of BRAC actions presented challenges during implementation. The BRAC 2005 round had more individual actions (813) than the four prior rounds combined (387). The executive staff of the Commission told us that it was more difficult to assess the costs and the amount of time for the savings to offset the implementation costs since many of the recommendations contained multiple interdependent actions, all of which needed to be reviewed. Specifically, many of the BRAC 2005 recommendations were interdependent and had to be completed in a sequential fashion within the statutory implementation period. In cases where interdependent recommendations required multiple relocations of large numbers of personnel, delays in completing one BRAC recommendation had a cascading effect on the implementation of other recommendations. Specifically, DOD had to synchronize the relocations of over 123,000 people with about $24.7 billion in new construction or renovation. Commission officials told us that in prior BRAC rounds each base was handled by a single integrated recommendation. However, in BRAC 2005, many installations were simultaneously affected by multiple interconnected BRAC recommendations. Given the complexity of interdependent recommendations, the Office of the Secretary of Defense required the military departments and defense agencies to provide periodic updates on implementation challenges and progress. Chairman Roe, Ranking Member Walz, and Members of the Committee, this concludes our prepared statement.

DOD has repeatedly applied the BRAC process to reduce the amount of unneeded property that it owns and leases and to save billions of dollars that could be applied to higher priority defense needs. This statement is based on GAO's April 2017 report related to VA facility alignment ( GAO-17-349 ) and numerous GAO reports related to the BRAC process as summarized in a June 2011 testimony ( GAO-11-704T ) and a March 2012 testimony ( GAO-12-513T ). This statement addresses (1) the factors that affect VA's facility alignment and the extent to which VA's capital-planning process facilitates the alignment of facilities with the veterans' population, and (2) the key elements and challenges affecting DOD and the Commission in BRAC 2005. Detailed information on our scope and methodologies for this work can be found in these published products, cited throughout this testimony. Geographic shifts in the veterans' population, changes in health care delivery, aging infrastructure, and limited stakeholder involvement affect the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) efforts to align its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. For example, a shift over time from inpatient to outpatient care will likely result in underutilized space once used for inpatient care. Further, the historic status of some VA facilities adds to the complexity of converting or disposing of them. In such instances, it is often difficult and costly for VA to modernize, renovate, and retrofit these older facilities. GAO reported that two of the planning processes VA uses to align its facilities—VA's Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) and the VA Integrated Planning (VAIP)—have limitations that undermine VA's efforts to achieve its goals. Specifically: VA relies on the SCIP process to plan and prioritize capital projects, but VA routinely asks its facility planners to submit their next year's planned project narratives before knowing if their previous submissions have been funded. The overlapping budget cycle, which is outside of VA's control, combined with other SCIP limitations—including subjective narratives, long time frames, and restricted access to information—make it difficult for VA to rely on SCIP to accurately identify the capital necessary to address its service and infrastructure gaps. VA concurred that it needs to address SCIP limitations that are within its control, as GAO recommended; VA has made some progress in implementing the recommendation has made some progress in implementing the recommendation.\\ The VAIP process is estimated to cost $108 million and to produce market-level service delivery plans and facility master plans. However, the VAIP master plans incorrectly assume that all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities without considering alternatives, such as purchasing care from the community. GAO recommended that VA consider discontinuing the VAIP facility master plans pending an assessment of their value as a facility-planning tool. VA agreed with the recommendation and is implementing it while pursuing a national realignment strategy.. Key elements of the Department of Defense's (DOD) 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process could benefit VA's asset and infrastructure review. The key elements included: (1) establishing goals for the process, (2) developing criteria for evaluating closures and realignments, and (3) establishing an organizational structure to develop closure and realignment options. GAO identified key challenges that affected DOD's implementation of BRAC 2005 and the results achieved; these challenges would need to be addressed if VA is to successfully apply the process. These challenges included: (1) large, complex recommendations required sustained senior leadership's attention and a high level of coordination among many stakeholders, and (2) the large number of actions that depend on each other for successful implementation. In the April 2017 report, GAO made recommendations related to capital planning and stakeholder involvement. VA concurred with the recommendations to the extent that they were within its control and has started making improvements.""]","2561","gov_report","en","None","174556232f2d7bf5ab477491480b96a74d365e7497069e2a","Summary:","gov_report","532","\n\nThe report highlights several challenges faced by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in aligning its medical facilities and services to meet the needs of veterans.

Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nSince DHS’s creation in 2003, significant internal control and financial management system deficiencies have hampered its ability to reasonably assure effective financial management and to manage operations. These deficiencies contributed to our decision to designate DHS’s management functions, including financial management, as high risk. To help address these deficiencies, DHS initiated a decentralized approach to upgrade or replace legacy financial management systems and has been evaluating various options for modernizing them, including the use of SSPs. DHS initiated three projects for modernizing the systems of selected DHS components, including its TRIO modernization project. The TRIO project has focused on migrating the financial management systems of Coast Guard, DNDO, and TSA to a modernized solution provided by IBC. DHS’s efforts to effectively assess and manage risks associated with this project are essential to DHS’s realizing its modernization goals. In 2013, OMB issued a memorandum directing agencies to consider federal SSPs as part of their AAs. Also, in May 2014, Treasury and OMB designated IBC as one of four federal SSPs for financial management to provide core accounting and other services to federal agencies. This designation was based on Treasury and OMB’s evaluation of the four service providers’ ability to assist federal agencies in meeting their accounting and financial management needs, including experience with implementing financial management systems and providing other financial management services to customers, cost of services provided, compliance with financial management and internal control requirements, commitment to shared services, capacity, and long-term growth strategy. FIT’s responsibilities related to the governance and oversight of federal SSPs were subsequently transferred to USSM after USSM was established in October 2015. Because of concerns that its Core Accounting System (CAS) Suite was outdated, inefficient, and did not reliably meet requirements, Coast Guard completed an AA in January 2012 to assist in developing a path forward for modernizing its financial management system. In August 2012, Coast Guard established its CAS Replacement project team to further evaluate two of the alternatives considered in its AA and develop a recommended course of action. In addition, Coast Guard determined that hosting, owning, operating, and managing a financial management system were not among its core competencies. Because TSA and DNDO also relied on CAS as their primary accounting system, they also conducted AAs to identify the best alternative for transitioning to a modernized financial management system solution. The AAs conducted by the TRIO components during 2012 and 2013 considered the use of federal and commercial SSPs and other options. In addition, Coast Guard completed additional market research including further analysis of commercial SSPs in June 2013. In July 2013, the TRIO components determined that migrating to a federal SSP was the best course of action and subsequently conducted discovery phase efforts with IBC from November 2013 through May 2014 to further explore the functional requirements for procurement, asset, and financial management services. Based on these efforts, in July 2014, the TRIO components recommended that they proceed with implementation of the IBC shared services solution. In August 2014, FIT and OMB concurred with this recommendation, and DHS entered into an interagency agreement (IAA) with IBC for implementation. Figure 1 shows a timeline of these key events. The IAA for implementation and related performance work statement included a description of the services that IBC is to provide and the roles and responsibilities of DHS, the TRIO components, and IBC. The IAA also required IBC to prepare a detailed project management plan describing how the requirements would be managed and updated and an integrated master schedule (IMS) for identifying tasks to be completed, duration, percentage completed, dependencies, critical path, and milestones. According to the February 2015 project management plan, DNDO, TSA, and Coast Guard were expected to go-live on the IBC solution in the first quarter of fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. However, in May 2016, DHS and IBC determined that TSA’s and Coast Guard’s planned implementation dates were not viable because of various challenges impacting the TRIO project and recommended a 1-year delay for their respective implementation dates. Figure 2 summarizes planned and completed key implementation events for the TRIO project as of May 2016. GAO, SEI, and other entities have developed and identified best practices to help guide organizations in effectively planning and managing various activities, including acquisitions of major information technology systems. These include GAO’s identified best practices for the AOA process and best practices identified by SEI for risk management. GAO-identified best practices for AOA process. GAO identified 22 best practices for a reliable, high-quality AOA process that can be applied to a wide range of activities in which an alternative must be selected from a set of possible options, as well as to a broad range of capability areas, projects, and programs. These practices can provide a framework to help ensure that entities consistently and reliably select the project alternative that best meets mission needs. Not conforming to these best practices may lead to an unreliable process, and the entity will lack assurance that the preferred alternative best meets the mission needs. Appendix II provides additional details on GAO’s identified AOA process best practices and how they can be applied to a wide range of activities in which an alternative must be selected from a set of possible options, as well as to a broad range of capability areas, projects, and programs. SEI’s risk management practices. SEI’s practices for the risk management process area call for the identification of potential problems before they occur so that risk-handling activities can be planned throughout the life of a project to mitigate adverse impacts on achieving objectives. These practices are determining risk sources and categories, defining parameters used to analyze and categorize risks and to control the risk management effort, establishing and maintaining the strategy to be used for risk identifying and documenting risks, evaluating and categorizing each identified risk using defined risk categories and parameters and determining its relative priority, developing a risk mitigation plan in accordance with the risk monitoring the status of each risk periodically and implementing the risk mitigation plan as appropriate. Although the TRIO components conducted AAs to identify the preferred alternative for modernizing their financial management systems, their efforts did not always follow best practices. For example, Coast Guard’s and TSA’s AAs supporting their selection of migrating to a federal SSP for modernizing their financial management systems did not fully or substantially meet all four characteristics of a reliable, high-quality AOA process. In addition, we found that DHS guidance did not fully or substantially incorporate five of GAO’s identified best practices for conducting an AOA process. The TRIO components’ AAs included descriptions of the key factors, such as scores for each alternative against the selection criteria used to assess it. Based on these AAs, DHS and the TRIO components selected the federal SSP alternative as their preferred choice and subsequently selected IBC as their federal SSP. However, because Coast Guard’s and TSA’s AAs did not fully or substantially meet all four characteristics of a reliable, high-quality AOA process, they are at increased risk regarding their decision on the solution that represents the best alternative for meeting their mission needs. Based on the extent to which the DHS TRIO components followed the GAO-identified 22 best practices for conducting an AOA process, we found that DNDO’s AA process substantially met the four characteristics of a reliable, high-quality AOA process while the Coast Guard and TSA AA processes both substantially met one and partially met three of these four characteristics. For example, we found that TSA’s AA partially met the “well-documented” characteristic, in part, because risk mitigation strategies, assumptions, and constraints associated with each alternative were not discussed in its AA. In addition, we found that Coast Guard’s AA partially met the “credible” characteristic, in part, because there was no indication that it contained sensitivity analyses, an evaluation of the impact of changing assumptions on its overall costs or benefits analyses. Our overall assessment is summarized in table 1. Appendix III provides additional details on our assessment of the TRIO components’ AAs for each of the GAO-identified 22 AOA best practices. Further, in comparing DHS AOA and AA guidance to the GAO-identified 22 AOA process best practices, we found that although DHS’s guidance for conducting both AOAs and AAs fully or substantially incorporated 17 of the identified best practices, the guidance did not fully or substantially incorporate 5 of these practices. For example, although the guidance addressed risk management in general terms, it did not detail the need to document risk mitigation strategies for each alternative. Not documenting the risks and related mitigation strategies for each alternative prevents decision makers from performing a meaningful trade-off analysis necessary to choose a recommended alternative. In addition, while DHS guidance describes the need for an AA or AOA review, it describes reviews conducted within the organizational chain of command and does not address the need for an independent review—one of the most reliable means to validate an AOA process. Further, although the guidance noted that weights for selection criteria may become more subjective when they cannot be derived analytically, additional guidance on weighting selection criteria was limited. Our overall assessment is summarized in table 2. Because of these limitations in guidance, and because Coast Guard and TSA did not fully adhere to the GAO-identified best practices, Coast Guard’s and TSA’s AAs did not fully or substantially reflect all four characteristics of a reliable, high-quality AOA process. As a result, Coast Guard and TSA increased their risk of selecting a solution that may not represent the best alternative for meeting their mission needs. Documentation supporting TRIO components’ AA efforts included descriptions of the key factors, metrics, and processes involved in conducting their analyses, including the (1) alternatives considered, (2) market research conducted, (3) three alternatives evaluated, (4) selection criteria used by each and how the criteria were weighted, (5) scores for each alternative against the selection criteria, and (6) alternatives that scored the best under the AOA evaluation. The TRIO components conducted market research to develop reasonable alternative solutions for consideration. For example, through its market research, TSA identified OMB-designated federal SSPs and commercial entities as potential alternatives for hosting and implementing a modernized and integrated financial management system. According to its AA, TSA was able to gain an understanding of the offerings, capabilities, and related costs associated with these alternatives through reviews of documentation and interviews. After developing a diverse range of financial system modernization alternatives for consideration, each of the TRIO components assessed them for viability using various factors—such as measures of effectiveness, cost, risk, and value—and identified the three top-rated alternatives for further evaluation. For example, Coast Guard identified nine alternatives for consideration and analyzed, scored, and ranked them to determine its top three alternatives for further analysis: incrementally improve the current CAS Suite and remove certain outdated components, host the financial management system internally using software and tools already owned, and use an SSP to host the financial management system. Each component identified its three alternatives for further evaluation and used defined selection criteria to rate them. For example, DNDO’s selection criteria included four categories of operational effectiveness that were weighted according to their level of importance. Based on their evaluations, each component identified the best alternative for its respective financial management system needs. According to Coast Guard’s November 2012 decision memorandum, Coast Guard further narrowed the alternatives it focused on to (1) using an SSP to host its financial management system and (2) hosting the system internally using already-owned software and tools, and it also gathered rough order of magnitude cost estimates for both alternatives. Based on its evaluation, Coast Guard determined that the two alternatives were comparable. According to this memorandum, Coast Guard further determined that owning, hosting, operating, and managing a financial management system were not among its core competencies. Based on this determination, OMB direction to agencies to use (with limited exceptions) shared services, and other factors, Coast Guard decided that migrating to an SSP was the best alternative. TSA found in its February 2013 analysis that the differences between federal and commercial SSP alternatives were not significant and, as a result, recommended that a competitive procurement be conducted to better evaluate each alternative. However, DHS officials told us that TSA subsequently determined that a competitive procurement was not warranted and chose to migrate to a federal SSP. This determination was based on additional OMB guidance issued in March 2013 directing agencies to consider federal SSPs as part of their AAs and stating that commercial SSPs are an appropriate solution and would be funded by OMB only in instances in which the agency’s business case demonstrates that a commercial SSP can provide a better value for the federal government. In addition, DNDO determined that migrating to a federal SSP was its best alternative in May 2013. Because its preliminary research focused primarily on the federal SSP marketplace, Coast Guard conducted additional market research to include a more robust analysis of commercial SSPs. Coast Guard’s June 2013 market research report described the results of this effort, including its evaluation of responses from 11 commercial SSPs. Coast Guard reported that none of the commercial SSPs that responded could meet all 44 specific financial management system requirements and the extent to which they could meet them varied significantly. Based on these results, Coast Guard determined that there was a lack of maturity in the commercial SSP market for federal financial management. According to the report, this overall assessment was based on various considerations of information provided by commercial SSP respondents, including the wide variety of proposed configurations, solutions, prices, and implementation schedules, the lack of federal experience and service for agency-wide capabilities, and insufficient length of service to establish positive trends in audit performance; the lack of similar offerings that implied a lack of strong competition between comparable products that would exert downward pressure on cost; and the lack of like product offerings, which increases the likelihood of higher switching costs in the case of poor performance because of increased difficulty in moving from one “turnkey” service to another. In July 2013, the TRIO components and DHS selected the federal SSP alternative as their preferred choice and subsequently selected IBC as their federal SSP. DHS officials told us that IBC was selected based on (1) DHS’s reliance on OMB and Treasury’s designation of IBC as a federal SSP, (2) OMB guidance to consider the use of federal SSPs, and (3) a review of the availability of the four federal SSPs indicating that IBC was the only one available to meet the requirements and implementation schedule at that time. In August 2013, DHS notified OMB that the TRIO components had performed extensive market research and finalized their respective AAs and independently concluded that migrating to a federal SSP was in the best interests of the government. Also, in August 2013, FIT notified OMB regarding the TRIO components’ AA efforts and that the TRIO components would proceed to the discovery phase with IBC. According to FIT’s notification memorandum to OMB, the TRIO components’ AAs demonstrated that migrating to a federal SSP was the best value to the federal government and that the components identified IBC as a suitable partner based on the results of their market research into federal SSPs. Risk management best practices call for the identification of potential problems before they occur so that risk-handling activities can be planned throughout the life of the project to mitigate adverse impacts on achieving objectives. These best practices involve (1) preparing for risk management, (2) identifying and analyzing risks, and (3) mitigating identified risks. Preparing for risk management involves determining risk sources and categories and developing risk mitigation techniques. Identifying and analyzing risks includes determining those that are associated with cost, schedule, and performance and evaluating identified risks using defined risk parameters. Mitigating risks includes determining the levels and thresholds at which a risk becomes unacceptable and triggers the execution of a risk mitigation plan or contingency plan; determining the costs and benefits of implementing the risk mitigation plan for each risk; monitoring risk status; and providing a method for tracking open risk-handling action items to closure. Based on our evaluation, we found that DHS processes generally reflected three of seven specific risk management best practices and partially reflected the remaining four practices. Table 3 summarizes the extent to which DHS followed these seven best practices for managing TRIO project risks. Additional details on DHS and TRIO component efforts to address these practices are summarized following this table. Prepare for risk management. Key aspects of processes established by DHS and TRIO components related to the three best practices associated with preparing for risk management: Determine risk sources and categories. This practice calls for a basis for systematically examining circumstances that affect the ability of the project to meet its objective and a mechanism for collecting and organizing risks. DHS and the TRIO components established processes that met this best practice. For example, DHS reviewed the integrated master schedule that IBC prepared to identify sources of risk and defined risk categories in TRIO project policies. Define risk parameters. Risk parameters are used to provide common and consistent criteria for comparing risks to be managed. The best practice includes defining criteria for evaluating and quantifying risk likelihood and severity levels and defining thresholds for each risk category to determine whether risk is acceptable or unacceptable and to trigger management action. DHS partially met this best practice. DHS’s risk management program defined rating scales to provide consistent criteria for evaluating and quantifying risk likelihood and severity levels. However, DHS’s Risk Management Planning Handbook and related template for developing risk management plans for projects did not address the need for thresholds relevant to each category of risk to facilitate review of performance metrics in order to determine when risks become unacceptable or to invoke selected risk-handling options when monitored risks exceed defined thresholds. Establish a risk management strategy. A risk management strategy addresses specific actions and the management approach used to apply and control the risk management program, including identifying sources of risk, the scheme used to categorize risks, and parameters used to evaluate and control risks for effective handling. DHS met this best practice. DHS and IBC established risk management policies and plans for the TRIO project based on DHS acquisition guidance, which provided a framework for a risk management program. Collectively, these policies and plans constitute a risk management strategy. DHS and IBC have periodically updated these documents to maintain the scope of the risk management effort; the methods and tools to be used for risk identification, risk analysis, risk mitigation, risk monitoring, and communication; the prioritization of risks; and the allocation of resources for risk mitigation. Identify and analyze risks. Key aspects of processes established by DHS and the TRIO components related to the two best practices associated with identifying and analyzing risks: Identify risks. Risk identification should be an organized, thorough process to seek out probable or realistic risks to achieving objectives. This practice recognizes that risks should be identified and described understandably before they can be analyzed and managed properly. Using categories and parameters developed in the risk management strategy and identified sources of risk guides the identification of risks associated with cost, schedule, and performance. To identify risks, best practice elements include reviewing the work breakdown structure (WBS) and project plan to help ensure that all aspects of the work have been considered. Best practices for documenting risks include documenting the context, conditions, and potential consequences of each risk and identifying the relevant stakeholders associated with each risk. DHS partially met this best practice. DHS’s July 2016 risk register contained a wide range of risks associated with defined risk categories. It also reflected DHS’s review of the TRIO project’s integrated master schedule that IBC prepared based on the WBS and work plans that IBC also developed. The risk register documented the context, conditions, potential consequences, and relevant stakeholders associated with each risk. However, DHS’s documented risk management processes did not identify all significant risks or reflect its efforts to revisit risks that had previously been closed. For example, DHS officials told us that IBC was unable to provide sufficient, reliable cost and schedule information for project monitoring; however, a risk reflecting these concerns was not included on its July 2016 risk register. Further, the risk register included certain closed risks related to the need for a governance structure and strategy for ensuring that IBC met performance, cost, and schedule objectives. Although DHS had ongoing concerns about its ability to ensure that IBC met these objectives, the risk register did not reflect efforts to revisit these risks to determine whether their status needed revision or if other risks should be included on the risk register to address its accountability concerns. In addition, DHS did not always take timely action to document its consideration of risks identified by its independent verification and validation (IV&V) contractor for potential inclusion on its risk register. For example, the IV&V contractor identified a risk related to inefficiencies in DHS’s document review process in June 2015 that was not included on DHS’s risk register until February 2016. DHS officials indicated that a crosswalk between the DHS risk register and IV&V contractor risk management observations was performed weekly; however, results of these weekly reviews were not documented. Evaluate, categorize, and prioritize risks. Risk assessment uses defined categories and parameters to determine the priority of each risk to assist in determining when appropriate management attention is required. Best practices for analyzing risks include categorizing risks according to defined risk categories, evaluating identified risks using defined risk parameters, and prioritizing risks for mitigation. DHS’s processes met this practice. For example, the documented risk management program included application of defined risk categories and parameters for all identified risks, providing a means for reviewing risks and determining the likelihood and severity of risks being realized. The TRIO project’s Joint Risk Management Integrated Project Team provided consistency to the application of parameters by reviewing risk assessments when risks were first identified. By determining exposure ratings for each identified risk, DHS prioritized risks for monitoring and allocation of resources for risk mitigation. Mitigate risks. Key aspects of processes established by DHS and the TRIO components related to the two best practices associated with mitigating risks: Develop risk mitigation plans. Risk mitigation plans are developed in accordance with the risk management strategy and include a recommended course of action for each critical risk. The risk mitigation plan for a given risk includes techniques and methods used to avoid, reduce, and control the probability of risk occurrence; the extent of damage incurred should the risk occur; or both. Elements of this practice include determining the levels and thresholds that define when a risk becomes unacceptable and triggers the execution of a risk mitigation plan or contingency plan, identifying the person or group responsible for addressing each risk, determining the costs and benefits of implementing the risk mitigation plan for each risk, developing an overall risk mitigation plan for the work to orchestrate the implementation of individual risk mitigation plans, and developing contingency plans for selected critical risks in the event impacts associated with the risks are realized. DHS partially met this best practice. DHS’s risk management program documentation reflected the development of risk response plans for most risks, including all those determined to be of medium and high exposure level. DHS identified those responsible for addressing each risk. However, DHS and IBC did not always develop sufficiently detailed risk mitigation plans including specific risk-handling action items, determination of the costs and benefits of implementing the risk mitigation plan for each risk, and developing contingency plans for selected critical risks in the event that their impacts are realized. For example, a risk associated with IBC’s capacity and experience for migrating large agencies the size of Coast Guard and TSA was identified in July 2014. Although DHS developed plans to help mitigate this risk, a contingency plan was not developed prior to realizing the adverse impact of not implementing Coast Guard and TSA on IBC’s modernized solution. Rather, a contingency plan working group (CPWG) to address this and other concerns was established in January 2017, over 2 years after the risk was initially identified. Further, thresholds were not used within the risk management program to define when a risk becomes unacceptable, triggering the execution of a risk mitigation plan or contingency plan. Implement risk mitigation plans. Risk mitigation plans are implemented to facilitate a proactive program to regularly monitor risks and the status and results of risk-handling actions to effectively control and manage risks during the work effort. Best practice elements include revisiting and reevaluating risk status at regular intervals to support the discovery of new risks or new risk-handling options that can require reassessment of risks and re-planning of risk mitigation efforts. Elements also include providing a method for tracking open risk-handling action items to closure, establishing a schedule or period of performance for each risk-handling activity, invoking selected risk-handling options when monitored risks exceed defined thresholds, and providing a continued commitment of resources for each risk mitigation plan. DHS partially met this best practice. Risk monitoring of the TRIO project consisted of reviews performed by DHS and TRIO component officials responsible for risk management and oversight functions. These reviews considered significant risks, risks approaching realization events, and the effect of management intervention on the resolution of risks. These reviews also relied, in part, on data contained in DHS’s risk register, which represents the official repository of TRIO project risks and information on the status of risks and related risk mitigation efforts. However, other aspects of DHS’s efforts to implement risk mitigation plans did not fully adhere to certain elements associated with this best practice. For example, we identified certain issues that raised questions concerning the accuracy of data contained in the risk register, such as (1) the lack of clear markings indicating when the accuracy of data on each risk was last confirmed, including risk records that had not been modified in the previous 3 months, and (2) certain risks for which the estimated risk impact date had already occurred but its status risk according to DHS’s risk register did not reflect that it had been realized and become an issue. In addition, DHS officials stated that IBC did not provide sufficiently detailed, reliable cost and schedule information that could have been used to monitor TRIO project risks more effectively. DHS’s ability to monitor cost, schedule, and other performance metrics was also limited because of the lack of thresholds for management involvement, as noted above. DHS’s implementation of risk monitoring plans was further limited by other issues, including (1) a period of performance for each risk-handling activity, which includes a start date and anticipated completion date to control and monitor risk mitigation efforts, was not always established and (2) an inability to fully track open risk-handling action items to closure existed because of the lack of sufficient detail on specific risk-handling activities in the DHS risk register. According to DHS officials, DHS relied heavily on IBC to manage risks associated with the TRIO project and, in particular, those for which IBC was assigned as the risk owner. They also acknowledged DHS’s responsibility for overseeing IBC’s TRIO project risk management efforts and described various actions taken to address growing concerns regarding IBC’s efforts. For example, DHS created the Joint Risk Management Integrated Project Team, in part, to provide a forum in which IBC could obtain assistance in developing risk responses and discuss DHS’s risk mitigation concerns. Further, to help reduce exposure of underlying risks, DHS offered assistance to IBC’s project management functions, such as developing the integrated master schedule and performing quality control checks on project deliverables. Despite these efforts, DHS officials stated that challenges associated with the IAA structure and terms of the performance work statement with IBC on the TRIO project limited DHS’s visibility into IBC’s overall cost, schedule, and performance controls and ability to oversee IBC’s risk management efforts. For example, they stated that the performance work statement did not specify the level of reporting to be provided by IBC on cost, schedule, and performance in sufficient detail to effectively monitor progress on achieving key project objectives. Further, the limitations to managing risks related to the best practices we assessed as partially met were largely attributable to limitations in DHS and TRIO project guidance and policies. For example, DHS’s Risk Management Planning Handbook and related template for developing risk management plans for projects does not address the need to define thresholds to facilitate review of performance metrics to determine when risks become unacceptable. Also, TRIO project policies did not address the need to periodically revisit consideration of risk sources other than IMS-related milestones, specify periods of performance for specific risk- handling activities, or define an interval for updating and certifying risk statuses. In addition, DHS guidance and TRIO project policies did not describe the need to consider and document risks specifically related to the lack of sufficient, reliable cost and schedule information to properly manage and oversee the project or for timely disposition of risks that its IV&V contractor identified. Further, TRIO project risk management policies and management tools used to implement them address best practice elements such as determination of the costs and benefits of implementing risk mitigation plans, developing contingency plans, and developing specific risk-handling action items. However, these policies do not require, and the risk register was not designed to specifically capture, these elements in documented risk mitigation plans. By not adopting important elements of risk management best practices into project guidance, DHS and the TRIO components increase the risk that potential problems would not be identified before they occur and that activities to mitigate adverse impacts would not be effectively planned and initiated. Although DHS has taken various actions to manage the risks of using IBC for the TRIO project, including some that were consistent with best practices, the TRIO project has experienced challenges raising concerns regarding the extent to which its objectives will be achieved. In connection with these challenges, the TRIO components notified DHS during April 2016 through January 2017 that certain baseline cost and schedule objectives had not been, or were projected to not be, achieved as planned. According to these notifications and DHS officials we interviewed, several key factors and challenges significantly impacted DHS’s and IBC’s ability to achieve TRIO project objectives as intended. In addition, IBC, FIT, and USSM officials identified similar issues impacting the TRIO project. In connection with these challenges, DHS and IBC began contingency planning efforts in January 2017 to identify and assess viable options for improving program performance and addressing key TRIO project priorities. Plans for DHS’s path forward on the TRIO project, as of May 2017, involve significant changes, such as transitioning away from using IBC and a 2-year delay in completing Coast Guard and TSA’s migration to a modernized solution. We grouped the key factors and challenges impacting the TRIO project that DHS, IBC, FIT, and USSM officials and OMB staff identified into five broad categories: (1) project resources, (2) project schedule, (3) complex requirements, (4) project costs, and (5) project management and communications. The key factors and challenges related to each category are summarized below. Project resources: Concerns about IBC’s experience and its capacity to handle a modernization project involving agencies the size of Coast Guard and TSA were identified as significant risks in July 2014, resulting from discovery phase efforts completed prior to DHS and IBC’s entering the implementation phase in August 2014. According to DHS officials, status reports, and other documentation, key TRIO project challenges related to resources included concerns that (1) IBC encountered federal employee hiring challenges and was unable to ramp up and deploy the resources necessary to meet required deliverables, and (2) IBC experienced significant turnover of key stakeholders which adversely impacted its ability to achieve TRIO project objectives. In connection with DHS’s decision to use IBC for the TRIO project, DHS officials told us that DHS relied heavily on OMB and Treasury’s designation of IBC as a federal SSP and their related assessment of IBC’s capacity and experience. DHS officials also told us that DHS relied on FIT’s federal agency migration evaluation model during discovery phase efforts that focused on assessing the functionality of the software rather than assessing IBC’s (1) capacity, experience, and capability; (2) ability to address more complex software configurations and interfaces associated with large agencies; and (3) cost, schedule, and performance metrics. DHS officials stated that issues related to IBC’s capacity and experience represented the most significant challenge impacting the TRIO project. IBC officials acknowledged that IBC was unable to ramp up its resources until after the project had begun and that the IBC project team experienced significant turnover in key leadership and TRIO project positions over the course of the project. IBC officials also acknowledged that during its early efforts on the TRIO project, assigned IBC staff lacked the experience and expertise necessary for managing large-scale projects and, as a result, many of the risks initially identified were not effectively addressed. FIT and USSM officials and OMB staff also acknowledged that resource challenges significantly impacted the TRIO project. A FIT official acknowledged that assessing software functionality, rather than implementation, was emphasized during the discovery process. Although DHS relied on OMB and Treasury’s designation of IBC as a federal SSP, this FIT official also told us that because agencies’ specific needs can vary significantly, agencies are responsible for conducting sufficient due diligence to assess a federal SSP’s ability to meet their requirements. Project schedule: DHS, IBC, FIT, and USSM officials acknowledged that migrating the TRIO components to IBC within original time frames was a significant challenge given the overall magnitude and complexity of the TRIO project. According to DHS officials and TRIO project documentation, DHS identified delays in completing various tasks and milestones including providing design phase technical documentation and design processing proposed change requests; meeting proposed baseline schedules for implementing Coast Guard and TSA on the modernized IBC solution; and achieving initial operating capability requirements and stabilizing the production environment after DNDO’s migration to IBC because of various issues related to reporting, invoice payment processing, contract management processes, and resolving help desk tickets in a timely manner. DHS officials also stated that IBC did not consistently update the IMS to ensure that it accurately reflected all required tasks, the completion status, and the resources required to complete them. Concerns related to meeting milestones and updating the IMS were discussed during periodic status update meetings that included DHS, IBC, OMB, FIT, and USSM officials. IBC and DHS officials acknowledged that processes for communicating and resolving issues were not always efficient and contributed to schedule delays. In addition, in November 2016, USSM noted several concerns based on its review of a draft IMS supporting TSA’s re-planning efforts to go-live in October 2017. USSM’s concerns included an incomplete project scope and schedule and need for additional discovery to determine cost and level of effort, an extremely aggressive schedule with very limited contingencies for the lack of interim checkpoints or oversight on tasks exceeding 30 days, the need for a resource-loaded IMS that incorporates an appropriate level of detail, and the need for an expedited program governance strategy and escalation path that DHS and IBC leadership could use to make program decisions within the time allotted on the schedule. Complex requirements: DHS, IBC, FIT, and USSM officials acknowledged the overall complexity of the TRIO project and that the lack of a detailed understanding of the components’ requirements earlier in the project impacted IBC’s and DHS’s ability to satisfy the requirements as planned. For example, USSM and FIT officials told us that under the shared services model, the approach for onboarding new customers usually involves migrating to a proven configuration of a solution that is already being used by the provider’s existing customers. However, rather than taking this approach, DHS and IBC agreed to implement a more recent version of Oracle Federal Financial software (version 12.2) with integrated contract life cycle and project modules. Under this approach, IBC’s plans included migrating other existing customers to this upgraded environment. USSM officials told us that migrating TRIO components to a new solution that required configuring new software and related applications and developing related interfaces introduced additional complexities that contributed to issues on the TRIO project. According to a FIT official, the functionality of this more recent version of software is very different than that of the version IBC’s existing customers used. This official stated that IBC did not have the needed government personnel with knowledge and experience associated with this new software, a condition that likely contributed to the challenges experienced on the TRIO project. IBC officials acknowledged that IBC’s lack of familiarity with Oracle 12.2 increased the complexity of the TRIO project. In addition, DHS and IBC perspectives on the need for changes differed because of the lack of clarity regarding TRIO project requirements. DHS officials told us that many change requests on the TRIO project reflected the need for required functionality based on previously stated requirements. They also told us that they did not consider DNDO-related requirements to be overly complex when compared to those associated with IBC’s similarly sized customers. However, DHS officials stated that as of June 2017, IBC has not yet met DNDO’s needs to deliver a functioning travel system interface and other requirements. According to IBC officials, TRIO project change requests to address components’ requirements were extensive and included significant customizations to meet unique requirements that were not aligned with the federal shared service model. IBC officials noted additional challenges in addressing TRIO project requirements related to DHS’s efforts to address certain organizational change management and business process reengineering responsibilities. According to IBC officials, in some instances, the TRIO components provided conflicting requirements related to the same process that would have been more consistent had DHS completed more of its business process reengineering efforts prior to providing them to IBC. Project costs: According to the July 2014 discovery report, proposed implementation costs for the TRIO project totaled $89.9 million. However, according to DHS officials and TRIO project documentation, estimated costs significantly increased because of schedule delays, unanticipated complexities, and other challenges. In January 2017, DHS prepared a summary of estimated TRIO project implementation costs associated with its IAA with IBC. According to this summary, estimated IBC-related TRIO project implementation costs through fiscal year 2017 increased by approximately $42.8 million (54 percent) from the $79.2 million provided in the original August 2014 IAA with IBC as a result of modifications required, in part, to address challenges impacting the project. DHS officials also expressed concerns regarding increases in estimated operations and maintenance costs for the IBC solution. For example, according to a December 2016 memorandum to DHS on action items associated with failing to meet the baseline schedule date for initial operational capability, DNDO stated that IBC’s updated projected costs of operations and maintenance of its system were unaffordable. In connection with these costs, DHS officials also stated that IBC determined that separate, rather than shared, help desk resources were required to support the TRIO project because it was significantly different from the solution that IBC’s existing customers used. As a result, the officials indicated that these costs were more than originally expected. However, IBC officials told us that a portion of the increase in help desk- related costs was also due to DNDO employees not using the system properly because they were not sufficiently trained on it before it was implemented. In addition, challenges impacting the TRIO project have contributed to significant changes in the path forward on the project; as a result, the extent to which overall TRIO project modernization costs will be impacted going forward has not yet been determined. Project management and communication: According to DHS officials, various program management-related challenges impacted the TRIO project. For example, they expressed concerns regarding the effectiveness of IBC’s project management efforts including cost, schedule, and change management as well as IBC’s allocation of resources and slow decision-making process. They also stated that DHS provided significant time and resources to make up for fundamental project management activities that were under IBC’s control and not performed. In addition, DHS officials identified limitations associated with (1) poorly defined service level agreements and program performance metrics, (2) poor quality control plan, and (3) the lack of mechanisms for measuring delivery and addressing concerns regarding IBC’s performance. DHS officials told us that although various mechanisms can be used to hold commercial vendors accountable—such as cure notices, quality assurance surveillance plans, and incentives or disincentives to monitor performance—few mechanisms are available to hold federal agency service providers accountable for performance concerns. DHS officials also acknowledged challenges in their project management and communication efforts and identified lessons learned to help improve future efforts, including the need to establish a performance-based contract to determine objective and enforceable activity level metrics; be more prepared for organizational changes; improve vendor, project, and schedule management efforts; better understand SSP resource plans and monitor SSP efforts to help ensure that sufficient resources are secured timely; and centralize program management for financial system modernization functions, rather than continuing with the structure used on the TRIO project—for example, the TRIO project’s program management structure consisted of program management offices at the component level performing cost, schedule, and technical monitoring activities with DHS headquarters’ involvement focused on governance and oversight, resulting in duplicate efforts across components. IBC officials acknowledged challenges concerning IBC’s lack of sufficient resources and turnover, as described above. However, they told us that DHS’s approach to project management often resulted in duplicative meetings and a lengthy decision-making process involving several officials and multiple review and approval processes. According to USSM officials, the TRIO project team focused an unbalanced portion of its efforts on the delivery of technology at the expense of organizational change management, communication management, and other project management areas. For example, the failure to incorporate lessons learned from DNDO’s deployment adversely affected subsequent TRIO project implementation efforts, as change management activities did not address previously encountered risks. An OMB staff member concurred with the lessons learned that DHS identified, including those indicating the need for stronger project management. While the project is ongoing, the OMB staff member noted the importance of DHS having well-defined requirements for the project and better coordination to achieve the desired outcomes. In connection with TRIO project challenges, DHS officials told us that IBC notified DHS in April 2016 that it would not be able to meet the planned October 2016 implementation date for TSA. In response, DHS and IBC established the TSA Replan Tiger Team to perform a detailed assessment of potential courses of action. According to DHS officials, DHS and IBC subsequently took various actions to help address these and other challenges impacting the TRIO project, as summarized below. May 2016: IBC requested additional funding for fiscal year 2016 for 14 additional IBC and contractor personnel to strengthen program coordination and management support. According to DHS officials, DHS provided this requested funding along with additional funding to establish a business integration office to help strengthen cross organizational communication. DHS determined that plans for migrating TSA and Coast Guard to IBC during the first quarter of fiscal years 2017 and 2018, respectively, were not viable. As a result, their planned migrations were each extended an additional year. June 2016: DHS and IBC developed a comprehensive remediation plan to track progress on efforts to resolve numerous issues associated with DNDO’s production environment that continued to hamper its stability since going live in November 2015. According to DHS officials, these issues related to invoice payment and interest accruals, contract life cycle management, reporting, and other activities and have required numerous work-arounds to execute business processes. August to October 2016: DHS, Coast Guard, and IBC determined that a similar replanning effort was needed for Coast Guard’s successful migration to IBC. According to DHS officials, IBC indicated that it was unable to simultaneously provide DNDO production and TSA implementation support while also addressing the complexities related to Coast Guard. DHS officials told us that another Tiger Team established to address Coast Guard issues failed to complete the scope of its charter, and as a result, Coast Guard was forced to assume a minimum of a 2- year delay (rather than the 1-year delay previously determined in May 2016) and that this significantly increased program costs. They further stated that some of the team’s deliverables have not been initiated or remain outstanding as of June 2017. December 2016: IBC communicated to DHS that it cannot support the discovery phase with DHS’s CUBE modernization project. In addition, DHS approved the establishment of a Joint Program Management Office to serve as the overarching program management for DHS financial systems modernization projects. According to DHS officials, using a department-wide approach will enable DHS to more effectively leverage the resources and expertise across all modernization projects. January 2017: IBC communicated to DHS that it cannot support Coast Guard implementation in October 2018, and DHS and IBC established a joint CPWG to assess viable options for improving program performance and addressing stakeholder concerns and key TRIO project priorities. February 2017: DHS and IBC issued a joint memorandum to provide an update on contingency planning discussions. DHS and IBC shared commitments and determinations included (1) stabilizing the DNDO production environment and executing TSA implementation activities, (2) delivering the best value for the government and ensuring mutual success to the greatest extent possible, (3) preserving and protecting the current investment, and (4) making TSA implementation the first priority. In addition, DHS and IBC presented two options as representing the best opportunities for success in improving program performance and addressing stakeholder concerns: (1) continue with the status quo plan for Coast Guard implementation in October 2019, with significant improvements to program management and overall support capability and capacity, or (2) platform replacement. Platform replacement was presented as the preferred path toward meeting the needs of both DHS and IBC. Under this option, DHS and IBC would proceed with TSA implementation and work toward an orderly transition of TRIO components to an alternate service provider, hosting location, or both. March 2017: According to DHS officials, DHS, IBC, and USSM officials met to review certain critical success criteria for TSA’s implementation. Based on these discussions, it was determined that TSA would not go live with IBC in fiscal year 2018 given the high-risk schedule and critical criteria involved and the Coast Guard implementation would also be delayed accordingly. Further, TSA release 3.0 would be delivered in October 2017 or as soon as possible thereafter. In addition, the CPWG would continue working to identify an alternative path forward, and DHS and IBC would identify and evaluate critical transition activities and timelines. April 2017: The CPWG recommended moving away from IBC to a commercial service provider leveraging the cloud as the best course of action to complete TRIO project implementation and as the most fiscally responsible approach from a long-term sustainment and cost perspective. The CPWG’s recommendation was based on its analysis of six options and proposed a transition timeline, including key activities, as shown in figure 3. May 2017: During its May 3, 2017 briefing of the Financial Systems Modernization Executive Steering Committee, DHS indicated that two of the options that the CPWG considered were no longer viable, including the CPWG’s recommendation to transition to a commercial cloud service provider because the software was not yet cloud-ready. DHS ranked the remaining four options using 13 OMB risk factors as selection criteria and determined that migrating the solution to a DHS data center represented the best option going forward. In addition, DHS decided to move forward with discovery efforts related to this option. According to its briefing presentation and DHS officials, the notional timeline of planned key events for the TRIO project included various items, as shown in figure 4. DHS officials indicated that DHS expects to present the findings and recommendations resulting from discovery efforts associated with this new path forward to USSM and OMB for concurrence. As of August 2017, results of this effort were under review by DHS leadership. The TRIO project represents a key element of DHS’s efforts to address long-standing deficiencies in its financial management systems and further improve financial management. Following best practices to manage risks effectively can help provide increased assurance that large, complex projects—such as the TRIO project—will achieve planned objectives. DNDO’s AA process substantially met the four characteristics of a reliable, high-quality AOA process. However, Coast Guard’s and TSA’s AAs substantially met one and partially met three of these four characteristics. Further, DHS did not always follow best practices for managing the risks of using IBC for the TRIO project. As a result, TRIO components faced an increased risk that the solution they chose would not represent the best alternative for meeting their mission needs and that the risks impacting the TRIO project would not be effectively managed to mitigate adverse impacts. In addition, significant challenges have impacted the TRIO project, raising concerns about the extent to which objectives will be achieved as planned. Plans for DHS’s path forward on the TRIO project, as of May 2017, involve significant changes, such as transitioning away from IBC and a 2-year delay in completing Coast Guard’s and TSA’s migration to a modernized solution. Without greater adherence to best practices for analyzing alternatives and managing project risks, DHS continues to face increased risk that its financial management system modernization project will not provide reasonable assurance of achieving its mission objectives. We are making the following two recommendations to DHS: The DHS Under Secretary for Management should develop and implement effective processes and improve guidance to reasonably assure that future AAs fully follow AOA process best practices and reflect the four characteristics of a reliable, high-quality AOA process. (Recommendation 1) The DHS Under Secretary for Management should improve the Risk Management Planning Handbook and other relevant guidance for managing risks associated with financial management system modernization projects to fully incorporate risk management best practices, including defining thresholds to facilitate review of performance metrics to determine when risks become unacceptable; identifying and analyzing risks to include periodically reconsidering risk sources, documenting risks specifically related to the lack of sufficient, reliable cost and schedule information needed to help properly manage and oversee the project, and timely disposition of IV&V contractor-identified risks; developing risk mitigation plans with specific risk-handling activities, the costs and benefits of implementing them, and contingency plans for selected critical risks; and implementing risk mitigation plans to include establishing periods of performance for risk-handling activities and defining time intervals for updating and certifying the accuracy and completeness of information on risks in DHS’s risk register. (Recommendation 2) We provided a draft of this product to DHS and the Department of the Interior for comment. In its comments, reprinted in appendix IV, DHS concurred with our recommendations and provided details on its implementation of the recommendations as discussed below. In addition, DHS provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. The Department of the Interior only provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. DHS stated that it remains committed to its financial system modernization program. Specifically, regarding our first recommendation to develop and implement effective processes and improve guidance to reasonably assure that future AAs fully follow AOA process best practices and reflect the four characteristics of a reliable, high-quality AOA process, DHS stated that it agrees that effective processes and guidance are necessary to assure best practices. DHS also stated that it is important to note that the GAO-identified best practices were published more than 2 years after the TRIO components’ AAs were completed. While this is the case, as discussed in our report, these best practices are based on long- standing, fundamental tenets of sound decision making and economic analysis and were identified by compiling and reviewing commonly mentioned AOA policies and guidance that are known to and have been used by government and private sector entities. DHS also stated that it has already implemented this recommendation through its issuance of guidance and instructions in 2016 and that a copy of this additional guidance and instructions was provided to GAO. However, the documentation provided by DHS does not fully address our recommendation. As part of our recommendation follow-up process, we will coordinate with DHS to obtain additional information on its efforts to address our recommendation. With regard to our second recommendation to improve the Risk Management Planning Handbook and other relevant guidance, DHS stated that it concurred and agreed that the Risk Management Planning Handbook required updating to fully incorporate risk management best practices. In addition, DHS described actions it will take, and has taken, to revise and publish an updated handbook. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, the DHS Under Secretary for Management, the Acting DHS Chief Financial Officer, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Director of the Interior Business Center. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staffs have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-9869 or khana@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. Key contributors to this report are listed in appendix V. To determine the extent to which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) followed best practices in analyzing the alternatives used in choosing the preferred alternative for modernizing TRIO components’ financial management systems, we reviewed information that the TRIO components provided as part of their alternatives analysis (AA) process, referred to as the AA body of work, which includes the AA and other supporting documentation that is not specifically included in the AA. In addition, we discussed the DHS AA process with the TRIO components and DHS officials. We evaluated each TRIO component’s AA body of work and assessed this information against the GAO-identified 22 analysis of alternatives (AOA) process best practices. We then scored each AA against those best practices. In appendix II, these GAO- identified best practices are described in detail. Our evaluation comprised the following steps: (1) two GAO analysts separately examined the AA information received for each component, providing a score for each of 18 best practices; (2) a third GAO analyst resolved any differences between the two analysts’ initial scoring; and (3) a GAO specialist on AOA best practices, independent of the audit team, reviewed the team’s AA documentation, scores, and analyses for consistency. The GAO specialist also assessed the four best practices related to cost estimating. We used the average scores for each best practice to determine an overall score for four summary characteristics—well-documented, comprehensive, unbiased, and credible—of a reliable, high-quality AOA process at each TRIO component. Next, we shared our preliminary analysis with the TRIO components and DHS, and requested their technical comments and any additional information for our further consideration. For those characteristics of the AA process that received a score of partially met or below, we met with TRIO component and DHS officials to discuss potential reasons that an AA did not always conform to best practices. Finally, using the same methodology and scoring process explained above, we performed a final assessment based on our preliminary analysis and the comments and additional information received. The best practices were not used to determine whether DHS made the correct decision in selecting Department of the Interior’s Interior Business Center (IBC) to implement the financial management systems modernization solution or whether the TRIO project would have arrived at a different conclusion had it more fully conformed to these best practices. We also reviewed DHS guidance for conducting AOAs and AAs against the GAO-identified 22 AOA process best practices using the same methodology described above for reviewing the TRIO components’ AAs. In the course of applying these best practices to a TRIO component’s AA and to DHS guidance for the AA process, we assessed the reasonableness of the information we collected. We determined that the information from the DHS AA process was sufficiently reliable to use in assessing the TRIO components’ AAs and DHS guidance against these 22 best practices. To determine the key factors, metrics, and processes used by the TRIO components in developing and evaluating DHS’s alternative solutions and final choice for financial system modernization, we reviewed each component’s AA, including a description of (1) the alternatives considered, (2) the market research conducted, (3) the three alternatives evaluated, (4) the selection criteria used and how the criteria were weighted, (5) how each alternative scored against the selection criteria, and (6) the alternative that scored the best according to the component’s evaluation. To determine the extent to which DHS managed the risks of using IBC consistent with risk management best practices, we reviewed DHS’s and TRIO components’ risk management guidance and other documentation supporting their risk management efforts, including risk registers, mitigation plans, status reports, and risk management meeting minutes. We also met with officials to gain an understanding of the key processes and documents used for managing and reporting on TRIO project risks. We assessed the processes against best practices that the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) identified. The practices we selected are fundamental to effective risk management activities. These practices are identified in SEI’s Capability Maturity Model® Integration (CMMI®) for Acquisition, Version 1.3. In particular, the key best practices for preparing for risk management are determine risk sources and categories, define risk parameters, and establish a risk management strategy. The key best practices for identifying and analyzing risks are evaluate, categorize, and prioritize risks. The key best practices for mitigating identified risks are develop risk mitigation plans and implement risk mitigation plans. We applied the criteria from the CMMI risk management process area to determine the extent to which the expected practices were implemented, or future activities were planned for, by the program office. The rating system we used is as follows: (1) meets, or generally satisfies all elements of the specific practice; (2) partially meets, or generally satisfies a portion of specific practice elements; and (3) does not meet, or does not satisfy specific practice elements. In the context of the best practices methodology, we assessed the reliability of TRIO project risk data contained in DHS’s risk register. We interviewed officials on how the risk register was developed and maintained, including key control activities used to provide reasonable assurance of the accuracy of the information reported in the register. We reviewed DHS’s July 2016 risk register and minutes from risk management committee meetings (one meeting per quarter, randomly selected). Of 120 TRIO project risks on the July 2016 risk register, we found 13 risks with missing data. Of 47 active risks identified, 28 risk records had not been modified in the previous 3 months and the register did not indicate when their accuracy was last confirmed and 35 risks were beyond their indicated impact dates but had not been marked as issues. We concluded that the pervasiveness of these data reliability problems decreased the usefulness of the risk register in connection with managing TRIO project risks. To determine the key factors or challenges that have impacted the TRIO project and DHS’s plans for completing remaining key priorities, we met with DHS, IBC, Office of Financial Innovation and Transformation, and Unified Shared Services Management office officials and Office of Management and Budget staff to obtain their perspectives. In addition, we reviewed documentation provided by these officials, including TRIO project status reports and memorandums, leadership briefings, and other presentations. We conducted this performance audit from March 2016 to September 2017 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Many guides describe an approach to an analysis of alternatives (AOA); however, there is no single set of practices for the AOA process that has been broadly recognized by both the government and private sector entities. GAO has previously identified 22 best practices for an AOA process by (1) compiling and reviewing commonly mentioned AOA policies and guidance used by different government and private sector entities and (2) incorporating experts’ comments on a draft set of practices to develop a final set of practices. These practices are based on longstanding, fundamental tenets of sound decision making and economic analysis. In addition, these practices can be applied to a wide range of activities in which an alternative must be selected from a set of possible options, as well as to a broad range of capability areas, projects, and programs. These practices can provide a framework to help ensure that entities consistently and reliably select the project alternative that best meets mission needs. The guidance below is an overview of the key principles that lead to a successful AOA process and not as a “how to” guide with detailed instructions for each best practice identified. The 22 best practices that GAO identified are grouped into the following five phases: 1. Initialize the AOA process: Includes best practices that are applied before starting the process of identifying, analyzing, and selecting alternatives. This includes determining the mission need and functional requirements, developing the study time frame, creating a study plan, and determining who conducts the analysis. 2. Identify alternatives: Includes best practices that help ensure that the alternatives to be analyzed are sufficient, diverse, and viable. 3. Analyze alternatives: Includes best practices that compare the alternatives to be analyzed. The best practices in this category help ensure that the team conducting the analysis uses a standard, quantitative process to assess the alternatives. 4. Document and review the AOA process: Includes best practices that would be applied throughout the AOA process, such as documenting all steps taken to initialize, identify, and analyze alternatives and to select a preferred alternative in a single document. 5. Select a preferred alternative: Includes a best practice that is applied by the decision maker to compare alternatives and to select a preferred alternative. The five phases address different themes of analysis necessary to complete the AOA process, and comprise the beginning of the AOA process (defining the mission needs and functional requirements) through the final step of the AOA process (selecting a preferred alternative). We also identified four characteristics that relate to a reliable, high-quality AOA process—that the AOA process is well-documented, comprehensive, unbiased, and credible. Table 4 shows the four characteristics and their relevant AOA best practices. Conforming to the 22 best practices helps ensure that the preferred alternative selected is the one that best meets the agency’s mission needs. Not conforming to the best practices may lead to an unreliable AOA process, and the agency will not have assurance that the preferred alternative best meets mission needs. The Department of Homeland Security’s TRIO components—the U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO)—conducted alternatives analyses (AA) during 2012 and 2013 to determine the best alternative for transitioning to a modernized financial management system solution. We evaluated the TRIO components’ AA processes against analysis of alternatives (AOA) best practices GAO identified as necessary characteristics of a reliable, high-quality AOA process (described in app. II). GAO’s assessment of the extent to which Coast Guard’s, TSA’s, and DNDO’s AAs met each of the 22 best practices is detailed in tables 5, 6, and 7. In addition to the contact named above, James Kernen (Assistant Director), William Brown, Courtney Cox, Eric Essig, Valerie Freeman, Matthew Gardner, Jason Lee, Jennifer Leotta, and Madhav Panwar made key contributions to this report.\n\n","[""To help address long-standing financial management system deficiencies, DHS initiated its TRIO project, which has focused on migrating three of its components to a modernized financial management system provided by IBC, an OMB-designated, federal SSP. House Report Number 3128 included a provision for GAO to assess the risks of DHS using IBC in connection with its modernization efforts. This report examines (1) the extent to which DHS and the TRIO components followed best practices in analyzing alternatives, and the key factors, metrics, and processes used in their choice of a modernized financial management system; (2) the extent to which DHS managed the risks of using IBC for its TRIO project consistent with risk management best practices; and (3) the key factors and challenges that have impacted the TRIO project and DHS's plans for completing remaining key priorities. GAO interviewed key officials, reviewed relevant documents, and determined whether DHS followed best practices identified by GAO as necessary characteristics of a reliable, high-quality AOA process and other risk management best practices. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) TRIO project represents a key effort to address long-standing financial management system deficiencies. During 2012 and 2013, the TRIO components—U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO)—each completed an alternatives analysis (AA) to determine a preferred alternative for modernizing its financial management system. GAO found that DNDO's AA substantially met the four characteristics—well-documented, comprehensive, unbiased, and credible—that GAO previously identified for a reliable, high-quality analysis of alternatives (AOA) process. However, Coast Guard's and TSA's AAs did not fully or substantially meet three of these characteristics, and DHS guidance for conducting AAs did not substantially incorporate certain best practices, such as identifying significant risks and mitigation strategies and performing an independent review to help validate the AOA process. Based on these analyses and other factors, the TRIO components determined that migrating to a federal shared service provider (SSP) represented the best alternative, and in 2014, DHS selected the Department of the Interior's Interior Business Center (IBC) as the federal SSP for the project. However, because Coast Guard's and TSA's AAs did not fully or substantially reflect all of the characteristics noted above, they are at increased risk that the alternative selected may not achieve mission needs. DHS also did not fully follow best practices for managing project risks related to its use of IBC on the TRIO project. Specifically, DHS followed three of seven risk management best practices, such as determining risk sources and categories and establishing a risk management strategy. However, it did not fully follow four best practices for defining risk parameters, identifying risks, developing risk mitigation plans, and implementing these plans largely because its guidance did not sufficiently address these best practices. For example, although DHS created joint teams with IBC and provided additional resources to IBC to help address risk mitigation concerns, it did not always develop sufficiently detailed risk mitigation plans that also included contingency plans for selected critical risks. As a result, although IBC's capacity and experience for migrating large agencies the size of Coast Guard and TSA was identified as a risk in July 2014, a contingency plan working group to address this concern was not established until January 2017. By not fully following risk management best practices, DHS is at increased risk that potential problems may not be identified or properly mitigated. DHS, IBC, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and other federal oversight agencies identified various challenges that have impacted the TRIO project and contributed to a 2-year delay in the implementation of Coast Guard's and TSA's modernized solutions. These challenges include the lack of sufficient resources, aggressive schedule, complex requirements, increased costs, and project management and communication concerns. To help address these challenges, DHS and IBC established review teams and have taken other steps to assess potential mitigating steps. In May 2017, DHS determined that migrating the solution from IBC to a DHS data center represented the best option and initiated discovery efforts to further assess this as its path forward for the TRIO project. GAO recommends that DHS more fully follow best practices for conducting an AOA process and managing risks. DHS concurred with GAO's recommendations and described actions it will take, or has taken, in response.""]","10649","gov_report","en","None","75e7f2ffc9c09f0868bfe03fab087139f2c0c5da17f6887f","Summary:","gov_report","532","\n\nThe report examines the Department of Homeland Security's Security's (DHS) TRIO components' alternatives best practices for modernization process of financial management, and the GAO-identified decision.

"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nThe United States has many international agreements that require treaty partners to provide certain information to IRS, which can help prevent the use of foreign bank accounts to facilitate tax evasion. FATCA goes much further, requiring FFIs to report more detailed information to IRS about their U.S. customers annually. These provisions are important developments in efforts to combat tax evasion by U.S. persons holding investments in offshore accounts. FATCA generally requires certain taxpayers to report foreign financial accounts and other specified foreign financial assets whose aggregate value exceeds specified thresholds to IRS on Form 8938. These taxpayers must report these assets and income generated from such assets to IRS with their tax return on Form 8938. These thresholds vary by filing status—such as single or married filing jointly—and by domestic or foreign residency. FATCA also promotes third-party reporting of foreign financial assets by requiring a withholding agent to withhold 30 percent on certain payments to an FFI unless the FFI or the jurisdiction in which the FFI is located has entered into an agreement with the United States to report certain account information of their U.S. customers. Under such an agreement, participating FFIs report detailed information to IRS annually about accounts held by their U.S. customers using an IRS Form 8966, FATCA Report (Form 8966). According to IRS, FATCA improves visibility into taxable income from foreign sources, and enhances the agency’s ability to identify and pursue taxpayer noncompliance. For example, FATCA allows IRS to compare information reported by FFIs on Forms 8966 to information reported by U.S. persons on Forms 8938. According to IRS, this comparison can be used to ensure taxpayers and FFIs are properly reporting foreign financial assets and income from international investments. This type of comparison is a common IRS enforcement technique. For example, IRS can directly compare information it receives from financial institutions’ IRS Form 1099-INT, Interest Income, against a tax return to determine if the taxpayer reported income generated from interest earned. To facilitate FATCA implementation for FFIs operating in jurisdictions with laws that would prohibit FFIs from complying with the terms of the FFI agreement, Treasury developed two alternative intergovernmental agreements (IGA)—Model 1 and Model 2—to facilitate the effective and efficient implementation of FATCA by removing partner jurisdictions’ legal impediments to comply with FATCA reporting requirements, and reducing burdens on FFIs located in partner jurisdictions. FFIs from countries with Model 1 IGAs report information on U.S. persons’ accounts to their respective host country tax authorities (HCTAs). The HCTAs, in turn, compile the information from FFIs and transmit it to IRS. In contrast, FFIs from countries with Model 2 IGAs, or countries treated as not having an IGA in effect, directly report information on U.S. persons’ accounts to IRS. Separate from the FATCA requirements, regulations implementing the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (BSA) also impose a separate self-reporting requirement for foreign accounts. Specifically, certain taxpayers and residents are required to file an FBAR with FinCEN annually if they have financial interest or signature or other authority over one or more foreign financial accounts with a total of more than $10,000, regardless of whether they reside within or outside the United States. Federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies can use information from these reports to combat financial crimes, including terrorist financing and tax evasion. Appendix IV provides a comparison of Form 8938 and FBAR reporting requirements. Figure 1 depicts the flow of foreign financial account information from U.S. persons and FFIs to IRS and FinCEN through the FATCA and FBAR reporting processes. As part of the FATCA reporting requirements, IRS collects information on financial accounts through forms and reports submitted by both taxpayers and FFIs. As part of this effort, IRS requires taxpayers to identify their TINs on Forms 8938 they submit. IRS also requires participating FFIs to report the TINs of each account holder who is a specified U.S. person on Forms 8966. IRS intends to use reported TINs to link Form 8938 data filed by taxpayers to Form 8966 data filed by the FFIs to ensure that taxpayers and FFIs are properly reporting foreign financial assets. However, IRS often could not link account information collected from FFIs to the account’s owner because of incorrect or missing TINs. In July 2018, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) found that almost half of new Forms 8966 filed by FFIs did not include a TIN or included an invalid TIN. A consulting firm working with FFIs to implement FATCA reporting requirements told us that FFIs encountered significant challenges obtaining accurate TINs from U.S. persons as part of the self-certification process. For instance, FFIs encountered situations where U.S. persons provided incomplete or inaccurate TINs—such as Social Security Numbers (SSN) with less than nine digits—on forms used to self-certify their status as U.S. persons. FFIs also encountered situations where U.S. persons may not have obtained TINs or were unwilling to provide them to FFIs. Additionally, banking associations told us that it has taken time, effort, and expense for FFIs to report TINs, as they had to upgrade computer systems to collect and record TINs from U.S. customers. Finally, Treasury told us that jurisdictions that have an IGA with the United States but no legal requirement to collect TINs are not in compliance with the requirements of the IGA. Treasury and IRS determined that some FFIs reporting from countries with Model 1 IGAs needed additional time to implement procedures to obtain and report required U.S. TINs for preexisting accounts that are U.S. reportable accounts. Consequently, IRS provided a transition period, through the end of 2019, for compliance with the TIN requirements for FFIs under Model 1 IGAs. Specifically, in September 2017, IRS issued a notice modifying procedures for FFIs reporting from countries with Model 1 IGAs to become compliant with TIN reporting requirements for preexisting accounts. For calendar years 2017-2019, IRS will not determine that certain FFIs in countries with Model 1 IGAs are significantly noncompliant with their obligations under the IGA solely as a result of a failure to report U.S. TINs associated with the FFI’s U.S. reportable accounts, providing they (1) obtain and report the date of birth of each account holder and controlling person whose TIN is not reported, (2) make annual requests for missing TINs from each account holder, and (3) search electronically searchable data maintained by such FFIs for missing required U.S. TINs before reporting information that relates to calendar year 2017 to a partner jurisdiction. As a result, even without any further extensions, calendar year 2020 is the earliest IRS will be enforcing requirements for FFIs from countries with Model 1 IGAs to provide accurate and complete information on U.S. account holders’ TINs to IRS. Without valid TINs on Forms 8966 submitted by FFIs, according to IRS officials, IRS faces significant hurdles in matching accounts reported by FFIs to those reported by individual tax filers on their Forms 8938. As a result, IRS must rely on information such as names, dates of birth, and addresses that the filers and/or FFIs may not consistently report. Without data that can be reliably matched between Forms 8938 and 8966, IRS’s ability to identify taxpayers not reporting accurate or complete information on specified foreign financial assets is hindered, interfering with its ability to enforce compliance with FATCA reporting requirements, and ensure taxpayers are paying taxes on income generated from such assets. In July 2018, TIGTA reported that IRS lacked success in matching FFI and individual taxpayer data because reports FFIs filed did not include or included invalid TINs. This, in turn, affected IRS’s ability to identify and enforce requirements for individual taxpayers. TIGTA recommended, among other things, that IRS initiate compliance efforts to address and correct missing or invalid TINs on Form 8966 filings from FFIs from countries with Model 2 IGAs or without any IGAs with the United States. IRS management said it disagreed with this recommendation because a system to ensure validation of every TIN upon submission of a Form 8966 would be cost prohibitive. However, IRS management said that IRS would address invalid TINs as they are uncovered on other compliance efforts, such as initiating development of a data product to automate risk assessments across the FATCA filing population. IRS also said it continues efforts to systematically match Form 8966 and Form 8938 data to identify nonfilers and underreporting related to U.S. holders of foreign accounts. However, IRS management told us they are waiting until they have a full set of data, including TINs, before doing analysis to develop a compliance strategy. According to TIGTA, IRS management believed that having the FFI’s Global Intermediary Identification Number (GIIN) on Form 8938, which is filed by the taxpayer, would help with matching records. However, Form 8938 instructions identify that the field is optional for taxpayers to complete. TIGTA recommended that to reduce taxpayer burden in obtaining GIINs from FFIs, IRS add guidance to Form 8938 instructions to inform taxpayers on how to use the FFI List Search and Download Tool on the IRS’s website to obtain an FFI’s GIIN. IRS agreed with this recommendation. However, even if an individual taxpayer provided GIINs, IRS may continue to have difficulty matching accounts with U.S. taxpayers if the TIN and name of the account holder reported on the Form 8966 do not match the TIN and name of the taxpayer on the Form 8938. IRS officials said they are aware of these difficulties and have attempted to match Forms 8938 and 8966 based on other criteria such as dates of birth. In its response to our draft report, IRS said that all financial institutions and foreign tax authorities that file required account information receive a notification listing administrative and other minor errors contained in their reporting. According to IRS, its Large Business and International division follows up with foreign tax authorities regarding these errors to ensure the tax authorities are working with financial institutions to correct these errors in compliance with the countries’ IGAs. IRS added it has initiated a campaign addressing FFIs that do not meet their compliance responsibilities with respect to account opening requirements. Additionally, IRS drafted a risk acceptance form and tool addressing risks in implementing FATCA compliance and business process capabilities. This risk assessment focused on the limitations IRS faces due to budget constraints, but did not address the specific risks it faces from not receiving complete and valid TINs on U.S. account holders. We previously reported that risk management could help stakeholders make decisions about assessing risk, allocating resources, and taking actions under conditions of uncertainty. Key management practices for risk management we identified from our prior work include identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing risks; developing a mitigation plan to address identified risks; implementing the plan; and monitoring, reporting, and controlling risks. Without developing a risk mitigation plan to address risks IRS faces from not receiving complete and valid TINs moving forward, IRS may lose opportunities to adjust its compliance programs to better identify U.S. persons who are not fully reporting specified foreign financial assets as required under FATCA. Several IRS databases store data collected from individuals’ electronic and paper filings of Form 8938 and/or elements of parent individual tax returns to which the Form 8938 is attached—the filer’s country of residence and filing status—used to determine specified reporting thresholds for Form 8938 filers. Additionally, data from these databases and other sources are transferred downstream to IRS’s Compliance Data Warehouse (CDW)—a database used for research and analytical purposes. We extracted data from copies of Individual Return Transaction File (IRTF) and Modernized Tax Return Database (MTRDB) data copied into CDW to obtain information reported on Forms 8938 and relevant information from parent tax returns, such as filing status and filers’ country of residence. We found that IRTF and MTRDB had inconsistent and incomplete data. For example, neither database had consistent and complete information on foreign financial account and other asset information submitted by Form 8938 filers. While IRS officials told us that IRTF is the authoritative source for filers of Form 8938, it does not store account and other asset information submitted on Forms 8938. Additionally, IRS officials said MTRDB is not designed to store information submitted on paper filings of Forms 8938 and parent tax returns. Officials from IRS’s Research, Applied Analytics and Statistics (RAAS) division also noted that CDW did not have reliable information from Form 8938 paper filings. Because of the lack of foreign financial asset information from such filings, we could not report complete information on assets reported by Form 8938 filers. Further, IRS does not provide instructions to CDW users on how to extract appropriate data from CDW—such as data copied from IRTF and MTRDB—leading to confusion on which databases to use for extracting Form 8938 and relevant parent tax return data. For example, five distinct tables within CDW are required to identify the TIN, parent form, filing status, country of residence, and amount of foreign assets accurately. Without clear explanations of how data in each of these tables relate to each other and to the underlying filings, errors could be introduced into CDW users’ analyses of foreign asset information. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government notes that management should use quality information to achieve the entity’s objectives. One attribute of this principle includes processing data into quality information that is appropriate, current, complete, accurate, accessible, and provided on a timely basis. Additionally, the Internal Revenue Manual states that IRS needs to measure taxpayer compliance so that customer-focused programs and services can be enhanced or developed so that compliance information and tools can be improved. According to IRS officials, IRS researchers have been taking additional steps to obtain and review Form 8938 and parent tax return data stored in the Integrated Production Model (IPM) database. They said IPM is the only database that contains complete data from individuals’ electronic and paper filings of Forms 8938 and relevant elements of parent tax returns. IRS officials said that RAAS has been working with IRS’s information technology (IT) division to obtain read-only access to IPM, and import Forms 8938 and 8966 data from IPM into CDW for analysis. However, as of February 2019, this effort has been delayed due to budget constraints. In its response to our draft report, IRS said that obtaining read-only access would require a new technical process and plans to continue working with IT on the feasibility and timeframe for enabling this access. Enabling access to consistent and complete Form 8938 and parent tax return data for compliance staff and researchers from RAAS and other IRS business units would help IRS strengthen its efforts to enforce compliance with FATCA reporting requirements and conduct research to bolster enforcement efforts. However, such efforts may be hampered until IRS can ensure readily available access to such data. We previously recommended that IRS develop a broad strategy, including a timeline and performance measures, for how IRS intends to use FATCA information to improve tax compliance. IRS agreed with this recommendation and developed a strategy for FATCA in July 2013. IRS updated the strategy in 2016 by creating the FATCA Compliance Roadmap as a comprehensive plan to articulate IRS’s priorities to facilitate compliance with FATCA reporting requirements. The roadmap also provided an overview of compliance activities used solely for enforcing FATCA reporting requirements or enhancing existing compliance efforts. However, in July 2018, TIGTA reported that IRS had not updated the FATCA Compliance Roadmap since 2016, and had taken limited or no action on a majority of the planned activities outlined in it. We also found that IRS had not yet evaluated the effects of FATCA, including the effects on voluntary tax compliance. IRS documentation states that only 7 of 31 capabilities outlined in the FATCA Compliance Roadmap were delivered due to funding constraints. As of October 2018, IRS has stopped using the FATCA Compliance Roadmap and has not developed a revised comprehensive plan to manage efforts to leverage FATCA data to improve taxpayer compliance. According to IRS officials, IRS moved away from updating broad strategy documents, such as the FATCA Compliance Roadmap, to focus on individual compliance campaigns. These include a campaign to match individual tax filers to the reports from FFIs, and another campaign to identify FFIs with FATCA reporting requirements who are not meeting all of their obligations. According to what IRS told us, with the passage of time and as FATCA is becoming more integrated into agency operations, it has moved from updating the broad strategy documents focused on FATCA to working on compliance campaigns that incorporate FATCA into overall tax administration. Additionally, IRS and outside researchers plan to study the role of enforcement in driving overall patterns in reporting offshore assets and income generated from such assets. Though IRS maintains that FATCA is more integrated into its operations, TIGTA’s 2018 report concluded that IRS was still unprepared to enforce compliance with FATCA in part because it took limited or no action on the majority of planned activities outlined in the FATCA Compliance Roadmap. Documenting a framework for using FATCA reporting requirements to improve taxpayer compliance and measure their effect is consistent with three steps we found leading public sector organizations take to increase the accountability of their initiatives: (1) define clear missions and desired outcomes; (2) measure performance to gauge progress; and (3) use performance information as a basis for decision-making. We also previously reported that it is important for IRS to use a documented framework that defines a clear strategy, timeline, and plans for assessment. Having such a framework in place can help IRS better allocate resources and avoid unnecessary costs resulting from not having the necessary or appropriate data available to execute its objectives. In light of the challenges IRS faces to collect, manage, and use FATCA data to improve compliance in a resource-constrained environment, employing a comprehensive plan would help IRS maximize the use of collected data and better leverage individual campaigns to increase taxpayer compliance. Without such a plan, IRS’s ability to collect and leverage data collected under FATCA for compliance enforcement and other purposes is constrained. We could not report on total values of foreign financial assets on Forms 8938 in tax years 2015 and 2016. However, we could provide a range of total maximum account values reported on FBARs during the same period. Specifically, we determined that more than 900,000 individuals filed FBARs in calendar years 2015 and 2016, and declared total maximum values of accounts ranging from about $1.5 trillion to more than $2 trillion each year. A little more than one in five—or about 21.7 percent—of the approximately 404,800 Forms 8938 filed with IRS in tax year 2016 were done so from U.S. persons living abroad, with the other 78.3 percent living in the United States. Table 1 shows that a higher proportion of Form 8938 filings from U.S. persons living abroad for tax year 2016 were filed on paper (43.3 percent) than Form 8938 filings from U.S. persons living in the United States during the same period (14.7 percent). We extracted these data from IRTF, which IRS officials said is the authoritative source for filers of Form 8938. However, we could not report complete information on foreign financial assets reported by Form 8938 filers because such data are incomplete; as noted above, IRS databases we used to extract Form 8938 data—IRTF and MTRDB—do not include asset information reported on paper filings of Forms 8938. Of the approximately 404,800 Forms 8938 filed by individuals for tax year 2016—the most recent data available—we could access information on residency of filers and reported foreign financial assets from about 277,600 Forms 8938 that did not indicate that foreign financial assets and values were declared on other forms besides the Form 8938. Of the subset of these Forms 8938, more than one quarter—or about 73,500— reported foreign financial assets in amounts that indicate the Form 8938 may have been filed unnecessarily, since they reported specified foreign financial assets with aggregate values at or below reporting thresholds as of the last day of the tax year. Based on available Form 8938 data from tax year 2016, table 2 shows that about 61,900 filings from U.S. persons living in the United States and about 11,600 filings from U.S. persons living abroad during the same tax year reported specified foreign financial assets with aggregate values at or below end of tax year thresholds. These totals likely understate the total number of Forms 8938 that U.S. persons may have filed unnecessarily in tax year 2016; due to data limitations, these totals exclude Forms 8938 without asset information stored in IRS’s databases, including most Forms 8938 filed on paper and Forms 8938 where filers identified that they declared foreign financial assets on other forms besides the Form 8938. There is no clear explanation as to why some U.S. persons may have filed Forms 8938 unnecessarily. However, we identified a number of potential reasons from focus groups and other interviews with stakeholder groups. In focus groups we conducted, participants expressed confusion about IRS’s instructions for completing the Form 8938 and information provided on IRS’s website. In the instructions for completing Form 8938, IRS described the specific types of foreign financial assets that are to be reported on Form 8938, and the asset value thresholds that must be met for required reporting, depending on the location of residence and filing status of the taxpayer. IRS also posted responses to frequently asked questions on meeting FATCA reporting requirements on its website, and established a separate page on its website comparing foreign financial assets that must be reported on Form 8938 and/or FBAR. Nonetheless, focus group participants reported confusion on whether and how to report investment and retirement accounts and compulsory savings plans managed by their country of residence. In a meeting we convened with an organization representing tax attorneys, they told us taxpayers are unsure about what account values to report on the Form 8938. Tax practitioners participating in another focus group added that they filed Forms 8938 regardless of the aggregate value of the assets because it was too cumbersome for them to identify whether the assets exceeded reporting thresholds as of the end of the year or at any time during the year. IRS officials also cited a number of possible reasons why U.S. persons may be filing Forms 8938 unnecessarily. For example, it may be easier for U.S. persons to report all specified foreign financial assets they hold on the Form 8938, rather than determine whether the value of such assets met applicable thresholds. IRS officials also said that U.S. persons might complete a Form 8938 for reasons besides meeting tax-filing requirements, such as providing evidence of assets for a loan application. IRS’s Taxpayer Bill of Rights states that taxpayers are entitled to clear explanations of the laws and IRS procedures in all tax forms, instructions, publications, notices, and correspondence. Furthermore, one of IRS’s strategic goals is to empower taxpayers by making it easier for them to understand and meet their filing, reporting, and payment obligations. IRS officials said they hosted sessions for tax practitioners at IRS Nationwide Tax Forums to address FATCA reporting requirements. However, they said IRS has not taken direct steps to identify or implement actions to further clarify instructions and related guidance on IRS’s website for completing Form 8938, such as information on which foreign financial assets to report, how to calculate asset values, and determine whether such values exceed required reporting thresholds. Additionally, IRS officials said they have not conducted additional outreach to educate taxpayers on required reporting thresholds under FATCA, or notify Form 8938 filers of instances where aggregate values of specified foreign financial assets reported on Forms 8938 were below reporting thresholds. IRS officials said they have not made efforts to determine whether there is a pattern of unnecessary Form 8938 filings that they could address. Rather, they said they believed resources should be devoted to FATCA implementation in general. However, as shown above, we have identified many tens of thousands of instances where U.S. persons may have filed Forms 8938 unnecessarily. Without assessing factors contributing to unnecessary Form 8938 reporting—and identifying or implementing actions to further clarify and educate taxpayers on FATCA reporting requirements—IRS is missing opportunities to help taxpayers understand their filing and reporting obligations and minimize their compliance burdens while properly meeting their tax obligations. Additionally, IRS may be missing opportunities to reduce costs in processing forms that taxpayers did not need to file. Because of overlapping statutory reporting requirements, IRS and FinCEN—both bureaus within Treasury—collect duplicative foreign financial asset data using two different forms (Form 8938 and FBAR). Our evaluation and management guide for fragmentation, overlap, and duplication states that overlap occurs when multiple agencies or programs have similar goals, engage in similar activities or strategies to achieve them, or target similar beneficiaries. Table 3 shows that individuals required to report foreign financial assets on Form 8938, in many cases, also must meet FBAR reporting requirements. For example, specified individuals with foreign financial accounts exceeding $50,000 in aggregate value on the last day of the tax year must file both Form 8938 and FBAR if such values exceed the minimum Form 8938 thresholds; these thresholds depend on the filing status and address of specified individuals. Table 3 also shows that, in many cases, specified interests in foreign financial assets as defined in Form 8938 instructions are the same as the financial interest in such assets under FBAR. Further, as noted in table 3, the overlapping requirements lead to IRS and FinCEN collecting the same information on certain types of foreign financial assets. For example, both Form 8938 and FBAR collect information on foreign financial accounts for which a person has signature authority and a financial interest in the account. Form 8938 and FBAR also both collect duplicative information on several other types of foreign financial assets, such as foreign mutual funds and accounts at a foreign financial institution that include foreign stock or securities. Overlapping reporting requirements result in most Form 8938 filers also filing an FBAR during the same reporting year. Table 4 shows that close to 75 percent of Form 8938 filers in tax years 2015 and 2016 percent also filed an FBAR for the same year using the same TIN. Overlapping requirements to file both Form 8938 and FBAR increases the compliance burden on U.S. persons and adds complexity that can create confusion, potentially resulting in inaccurate or unnecessary reporting. Focus group participants in all five countries included in our study affirmed that U.S. persons experienced confusion and frustration with having to report duplicative foreign financial asset information on both forms. Focus group participants and others we interviewed also noted that U.S. persons incurred additional financial costs to complete and file both Form 8938 and FBAR. For instance, one tax practitioner in Canada said the charge was about $190 to report four-to-five accounts on an FBAR in addition to charging about $540 for basic tax return packages. An accounting firm based in Japan typically charged between $300 and $800 to complete a Form 8938 and between $150 and $500 to complete an FBAR, depending on the number of accounts reported on the forms. Proposed revisions to regulations implementing BSA proposed by FinCEN may also increase the number of duplicative foreign financial accounts reported on Form 8938 and FBAR. Currently, U.S. persons must report detailed information on all foreign financial accounts on Form 8938 if the value of such accounts and other specified foreign financial assets reaches applicable reporting thresholds. In contrast, U.S. persons are generally exempted from reporting detailed account information on FBARs if they report having signature or other authority over 25 or more foreign financial accounts. FinCEN’s proposed revisions to BSA regulations would eliminate the exemption, requiring U.S. persons to report detailed information on all foreign financial accounts in which he or she has a financial interest if the value of such accounts exceed FBAR’s $10,000 reporting threshold. FinCEN estimated that it will receive account information for the first time on about 5.4 million foreign financial accounts if it finalizes the proposed revisions. In turn, these revisions may lead to increased filings of duplicative asset data on both Form 8938 and FBAR, as U.S. persons may have to report detailed information on all foreign financial accounts using both forms. U.S. persons also face exposure to two different penalty regimes for any failures in accurately and completely reporting foreign financial asset information to two bureaus within Treasury—IRS and FinCEN. Officials from one organization representing U.S. persons living abroad said penalties due to failure to report certain accounts on one or both forms can be significant, even if little or no taxes are owed on those accounts. The duplicative reporting of foreign financial asset data on two different forms also creates additional costs to the government to process and store the same or similar information twice, and enforce reporting compliance with both requirements. In 2012, we recommended that Treasury direct the Office of Tax Policy, IRS, and FinCEN to determine whether the benefits of implementing a less duplicative reporting process exceed the costs and, if so, implement that process. Treasury did not implement our recommendation. While we continue to believe that the agencies should have considered whether less duplicative reporting could have been implemented, we do recognize that FATCA and FBAR were enacted under two different statutes to serve different purposes. As mentioned above, according to IRS, FATCA improves visibility into taxable income from foreign sources and enhances the agency’s ability to identify and pursue taxpayer noncompliance. In contrast, the information reported on the FBAR is collected to identify money laundering and other financial crimes; law enforcement agencies can use BSA information—including information collected from FBARs— to aid regulatory and criminal investigations. Additionally, data collected from Form 8938 and FBAR are used in different systems for use by different bureaus within Treasury. Fully addressing issues stemming from overlapping reporting requirements and the resulting collection of duplicative information—while at the same time ensuring that such information can be used for tax compliance and law enforcement purposes—can only be done by modifying the statutes governing the requirements. Further, IRS and FinCEN have varying degrees of access to foreign financial asset information collected from Form 8938 and FBAR to enforce tax compliance and financial crime laws. FATCA was enacted, in part, to improve visibility into taxable income from foreign sources. However, information provided on Forms 8938 is taxpayer return information protected by section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), which generally prohibits IRS from disclosing information provided on Forms 8938. IRS can share return information with other government agencies and others when it is allowed by statute. For example, under section 6103, IRS may disclose return information related to taxes imposed under the IRC—such as self-employment income tax, Social Security and Medicare tax and income tax withholding—to the Social Security Administration (SSA) as needed to carry out its responsibilities under the Social Security Act. However, according to FinCEN officials, FinCEN, law enforcement, and regulators often cannot access information submitted on Forms 8938. While section 6103 provides other exceptions to disclosure prohibitions—such as allowing IRS to share return information with law enforcement agencies for investigation and prosecution of nontax criminal laws—such information is generally only accessible pursuant to a court order. As noted above, information reported on the FBAR can be used by law enforcement agencies to aid regulatory and criminal investigations. This includes IRS, which has been delegated responsibility from FinCEN to enforce compliance with FBAR reporting requirements. IRS has used FBAR information in addressing taxpayer noncompliance with reporting and paying taxes on foreign assets and income. For example, taxpayers accepted into one of IRS’s offshore voluntary disclosure programs must have filed amended or late FBARs as part of their program applications. Investigators from IRS’s Criminal Investigation division generally reviewed applications to determine if the taxpayer has made a complete and truthful disclosure. IRS examiners can also use information from case files of program participants—such as information disclosed on FBARs— to identify new groups of taxpayers suspected of hiding income offshore. IRS can then choose to continue offering offshore programs and encourage these newly identified groups of taxpayers, as well as all taxpayers with unreported offshore accounts, to disclose their accounts voluntarily. In addition to eliminating overlapping reporting requirements, harmonizing statutes governing foreign financial asset reporting and use of information collected on such assets to make such statutes fully consistent could yield additional benefits to both IRS and the law enforcement community. Specifically, and as shown in appendix IV, there are specified foreign financial assets reported on Form 8938—such as foreign hedge funds and foreign private equity funds—that are not required to be reported on an FBAR. In contrast, there are other specified foreign financial assets reported on an FBAR—such as indirect interests in foreign financial assets through an entity—that are not required to be reported on Form 8938. Without congressional action to address overlap in foreign financial asset reporting requirements, IRS and FinCEN will neither be able to coordinate efforts to collect and use foreign financial asset information, nor reduce unnecessary burdens faced by U.S. persons in reporting duplicative foreign financial asset information. Two reporting systems for sharing foreign account information from foreign financial institutions are in operation globally—FATCA and the Common Reporting Standard (CRS). According to officials from banking associations and a consulting firm, FFIs in the countries where we examined FATCA implementation encountered challenges implementing and now maintaining two overlapping reporting systems for collecting and transmitting account information to other countries for a seemingly similar purpose, and collecting sufficient information from customers to ensure they meet the requirements of both systems. As noted above, we previously identified overlap as occurring when multiple agencies or programs have similar goals, engage in similar activities or strategies to achieve them, or target similar beneficiaries. According to an IRS official, collecting account information under FATCA ushered in an era of greater transparency; as noted above, FATCA’s passage sought to reduce tax evasion by creating greater transparency and accountability with respect to offshore accounts and other assets held by U.S. taxpayers. When FATCA was first introduced, there was no international platform to share account information between countries. The United States and other countries worked together to reach an agreement on the electronic formatting that would be used to share the information. Other countries tax authorities’ became more interested in understanding the financial assets held abroad by their residents through an exchange of account information among themselves. In response, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) established the CRS reporting system for automatic exchange of information among member countries. According to the OECD, CRS was developed with a view to maximize efficiency and reduce cost for financial institutions. Thus, CRS drew extensively on the intergovernmental approach used to implement FATCA reporting requirements for FFIs. Countries participating in CRS exchange account information with each other using OECD’s Common Transmission System, which was modeled on FATCA’s International Data Exchange System. Figure 2 depicts the flow of account information between countries under FATCA and CRS. CRS reporting requirements are in many ways similar to FATCA, including required reporting of the account holders’ name and address, taxpayer identification number, account number, account balance, and income and sales proceeds. However, the requirements differ in significant ways. The biggest differences in requirements are driven by the nature of the U.S. tax system. The United States, like many countries, generally taxes citizens and resident aliens on their worldwide income regardless of where that income is earned. However, the United States differs from other countries because it generally subjects U.S. citizens who reside abroad to U.S. taxation in the same manner as U.S. residents. In contrast to U.S. policy, most other countries do not tax their citizens if they reside in a country other than their country of citizenship. Further, IGAs implementing FATCA require FFIs to report the foreign-held accounts of U.S. citizens and residents—including resident aliens—while CRS requires financial institutions in jurisdictions participating in CRS to report on almost all accounts held by nonresidents of the reporting country. Appendix V provides more detailed information on differences in reporting requirements, due diligence requirements, and definitions under FATCA and CRS. These differences in tax systems drive variations in due diligence procedures between FATCA and CRS. For example, FATCA aims to identify whether an account holder at a foreign institution is a U.S. person based on citizenship and tax residency information. In contrast, CRS aims to identify the tax residency of all account holders of a financial institution, and does not consider citizenship. Due to the multilateral nature of CRS, if an account holder is determined on the basis of the due diligence procedures to have residency in two or more countries, information would be exchanged with all jurisdictions in which the account holder is determined a resident for tax purposes. Under CRS rules, information about foreign accounts held by a U.S. citizen with a tax residence abroad would not be reported to IRS, but rather to the jurisdiction in which they were a resident for tax purposes. Because the United States taxes the worldwide income of U.S. citizens, CRS rules would need to require identification of account holders’ citizenship in member countries where they are residents if FATCA were to be aligned with CRS. Table 5 shows a comparison of individuals reported to IRS under FATCA and hypothetically under CRS. Treasury and IRS, as part of its 2017-2018 Priority Guidance Plan, are considering modifying certain elements of the existing FATCA regulations. For instance, Treasury and IRS are considering coordinating certain documentation requirements for participating FFIs with the requirements under IGAs. In December 2018, Treasury and IRS also proposed regulations intended, in part, to reduce the burdens of FATCA. The proposed regulations included a clarification of the definition of an investment entity that is similar to the guidance published by OECD interpreting the definition of a “managed by” investment entity under CRS. If the United States wanted to adopt CRS, some of the key differences between FATCA and CRS—as outlined above and in appendix V—could be aligned through regulation while others would require legislation. According to Treasury officials, to align FATCA and CRS, Congress would need to revise statutes to: provide for the collection of information for accounts that residents of partner jurisdictions maintain at U.S. financial institutions; require certain U.S. financial institutions to report the account balance (including, in the case of a cash value insurance contract or annuity contract, the cash value or surrender value) for all financial accounts maintained at a U.S. office and held by foreign residents; expand the current reporting required with respect to U.S. source income paid to accounts held by foreign residents to include similar non-U.S. source payments; require financial institutions to report the gross proceeds from the sale or redemption of property held in, or with respect to, a financial account; and require financial institutions to report information with respect to financial accounts held by certain passive entities with substantial foreign owners. While better aligning FATCA and CRS to some extent is possible, anything short of the United States fully adopting CRS would not fully eliminate the burdens of overlapping requirements that FFIs must currently meet under the two different systems. While having the United States adopt the CRS reporting system in lieu of FATCA could benefit FFIs that may otherwise have to operate two overlapping reporting systems, it would result in no additional benefit to IRS in terms of obtaining information on U.S. accounts. Additionally, it could generate additional costs and reporting burdens to U.S. financial institutions that would need to implement systems to meet CRS requirements. The extent of these costs is unknown. Further, adoption of CRS would create the circumstance where foreign accounts held by U.S. citizens with a tax residence in partner jurisdiction—including U.S. citizens who have a U.S. tax obligation—would not be reported to IRS. Tax practitioners and others we interviewed said that U.S. persons living abroad—whether or not they are required to complete a Form 8938—risk being denied access to foreign financial services. U.S. persons and tax practitioners located in four of the five countries where we conducted focus groups and interviews reported that some U.S. persons and U.S.- owned businesses encountered difficulties opening bank accounts with FFIs after FATCA was enacted, with some FFIs closing U.S. persons’ existing accounts or denying them opportunities to open new accounts. One focus group participant, for example, said that the financial institution closed down all accounts including business checking, savings, and money market accounts after FATCA was implemented, requiring this individual to find a local resident who could co-sign on a new account. Costs FFIs would incur from implementing FATCA were cited as a significant factor in increasing barriers faced by U.S. persons in accessing foreign financial services. Officials from one organization representing tax attorneys said that as a result of costs associated with FATCA implementation, FFIs have found it less burdensome to close accounts of U.S. persons or require the accounts to be moved to a Securities and Exchange Commission registered affiliate than comply with FATCA. Tax practitioners and an official from a bankers association added that because FFIs may gain only small margins of profit from U.S. persons, FFIs may believe it is too troublesome to do business with them. Additionally, officials from a foreign government agency told us that because FATCA is expensive for FFIs to continue implementing, banks in their country might charge U.S. persons seeking access to financial services additional fees to account for FATCA implementation costs. Tax practitioners, consultants working with FFIs to implement FATCA reporting requirements, and the National Taxpayer Advocate told us that FFIs with smaller asset sizes such as smaller trust companies were more prone to decline business with U.S persons. Officials from an advocacy group representing U.S. persons living abroad told the National Taxpayer Advocate that some smaller banks declined U.S. persons as customers as a business decision, believing it would cost more for them to comply with FATCA reporting requirements than maintain U.S. expatriates’ accounts. Banking associations we interviewed said that decisions made by FFIs on whether to accept U.S. persons as customers also depends on the overall risks and benefits of taking on individual U.S. persons, shaped in part from risks in not meeting FATCA reporting requirements. Representatives of a banking association and an advocacy group told us that some FFIs decided to avoid doing business with U.S. persons after they became concerned about potential penalties for failure to comply—either willfully or in error—with FATCA reporting requirements. One banking association added that such errors could affect other aspects of FFIs’ relationships with the U.S. government, such as nonprosecution agreements made with the U.S. Department of Justice. Officials from one consulting firm that helped FFIs meet FATCA reporting requirements added that FFIs’ determination of risk depends on many layers, such as the value of clients’ assets or the country in which clients reside or possess citizenship. After FATCA’s implementation, according to officials from the consulting firm, FFIs decided to turn away U.S. persons in some cases because the benefits of doing business with U.S. persons were less than the potential risks. For example, if a U.S. person only maintained a payroll account, the FFI may determine it would not make enough money to account for risks in incorrectly identifying the status of the customer as a U.S. or non-U.S. person. However, focus group participants from two countries said that FFIs may agree to accept U.S persons as customers if they have higher account balances that offset risks from FATCA reporting requirements. One focus group participant, for instance, said banks in his country will do business with a U.S. person if he or she has more than $500,000 in assets. Additionally, U.S. persons and tax practitioners we interviewed said that other factors such as language barriers and U.S. regulations designed to prevent money laundering may also inhibit U.S. persons’ access to brokerage accounts while overseas. Focus group participants and others we interviewed said that Form 8938 reporting requirements contributed to denials of employment and promotion opportunities for U.S. persons living abroad. Treasury officials noted that requirements imposed by FATCA do not directly hinder U.S. persons from gaining employment or promotion opportunities overseas. However, focus group participants, a consulting firm, and a foreign government agency noted that foreign-owned companies and nonprofit organizations such as churches did not want to hire or promote U.S. persons because they wanted to avoid exposing information to the U.S. government on their organizations’ accounts and client trust accounts where the U.S. person would have signature authority. As noted above, a U.S. person is generally required to report on the Form 8938 foreign financial accounts for which the person has signature authority if he or she has a financial interest in the account. Focus group participants and others noted that such requirements have adversely affected the ability of U.S. persons to serve on a corporate board or in a nonprofit organization, or maintain business relationships. Treasury and Department of Commerce officials stationed in one country included in our review added that FATCA implementation has played a role in dissuading foreign-owned corporations in some Asian countries from considering U.S. persons for corporate leadership positions such as directorships. This is in part because FATCA has triggered additional paperwork burden and operating costs for onboarding U.S. employees since they have had to help them meet Form 8938 reporting requirements. Two advocacy groups representing U.S. persons living abroad added that it is also harder for U.S.-based companies to justify relocating U.S. persons overseas and paying for such relocations since they also have had to help their U.S. employees meet Form 8938 reporting requirements in addition to meeting other tax filing requirements. U.S. embassy documents indicate there was increased demand for Social Security Numbers (SSN) since FATCA’s passage in 2010, driven in part by U.S. citizens applying for an SSN to gain access to foreign financial services or resolve outstanding U.S. tax obligations before completing renunciation. However, officials from two organizations representing Americans living abroad cited significant challenges faced by some U.S. persons living abroad in obtaining SSNs required to meet their U.S. tax obligations or obtain financial services. U.S. persons living abroad might not possess an SSN because their parents did not obtain one for them as a minor. Often, this may have been due to the parents leaving the United States when the child was young. State officials also said that U.S. citizens applying for U.S. passports while overseas frequently forget their SSNs or do not know if their parents ever applied for an SSN on their behalf. Officials from organizations representing U.S. persons living abroad added that without an SSN, these persons are unable to claim refunds or other tax benefits when filing their tax returns, or participate in IRS programs to voluntarily disclose previously unreported tax liabilities and assets. Additionally, some might be unable to gain or maintain access to financial accounts or other assets in their countries of residence without an SSN. According to these officials and tax practitioners we interviewed, U.S. persons living abroad face greater challenges in obtaining SSNs than those living in the United States. For instance, they faced difficulties obtaining documentation from the United States that the Social Security Administration (SSA) requires with SSN applications; traveling to Social Security offices and U.S. embassies or consulates to certify documents or submit applications in person; and receiving valid SSNs from SSA in a timely manner to file tax returns or participate in offshore disclosure programs. SSA officials also identified several challenges U.S. persons experience when applying for an SSN from abroad. For instance, SSA officials said that efforts to authenticate documents submitted with SSN applications can cause delays for U.S. persons living abroad in obtaining an SSN. Additionally, SSN applicants living abroad face significantly longer wait times than applicants living in the United States once their applications are processed. According to SSA officials, after an application is processed, it can take 3 to 6 months–-depending on the country’s mail service–-for an individual to receive a Social Security Card. This is significantly longer than the 2-week period it takes SSN applicants to receive a card after mailing in their applications from within the United States. According to Department of State (State) data, the annual number of approvals of requests for renunciations of U.S. citizenships increased nearly 178 percent during a 6-year period, from 1,601 in 2011—the year after FATCA was enacted—to 4,449 in 2016, the most recent year to which full data on renunciations were available. According to U.S. embassy documents and information provided by focus group participants and interviewees across all the countries we examined, FATCA was the reason or a contributing factor in some of these decisions and the resulting increase in total renunciations. Specific effects of FATCA implementation contributing to decisions to renounce U.S. citizenship included reduced access to foreign financial services and employment or promotion opportunities in a foreign-owned company—as identified above from our document reviews, focus groups, and interviews—and burdens in meeting FATCA reporting requirements. However, the extent to which FATCA implementation contributed to increased renunciations is unclear. State officials said that data are unavailable to determine the extent to which these renunciation decisions were the direct result of FATCA because State has no legal obligation to collect information on the motivation behind renunciation of citizenship. In response to concerns about the availability of foreign financial services, Treasury implemented regulations that allow certain low-risk local FFIs to be deemed compliant with FATCA, but only if the FFIs do not implement policies or practices that discriminate against opening or maintaining accounts for specified U.S. persons. Treasury and State also previously established joint strategies to address these challenges. For instance, Treasury and State developed guidance on FATCA that was posted on embassy websites to educate U.S. persons and others. Additionally, Treasury and State officials conducted outreach events and workshops through U.S. embassies and American chambers of commerce worldwide to provide information on FATCA and other tax filing requirements, According to State officials, the U.S. embassies in at least two countries—Switzerland and France—also worked with foreign officials and/or FFIs to increase access to financial services for U.S. citizens residing in those countries. For instance, Treasury and State officials reached agreements with FFIs in Switzerland to provide a wider range of financial services to U.S. persons. Similarly, in 2017, SSA and State implemented an interagency agreement to streamline processes for providing SSNs to U.S. persons living abroad after FATCA’s implementation in 2010. SSA officials said they are also in discussions with State on improving SSA’s website to include more transparent, specific information for SSN overseas applicants about SSA documentation requirements. Tax practitioners, advocacy groups, and Treasury officials we interviewed said FFIs have become more willing to accept U.S. persons as customers compared to when FATCA was enacted in 2010. However, U.S. persons living abroad continue to face issues gaining access to foreign financial services. For example, in a September 2018 letter sent by the Chair of the Finance Committee of the Netherlands House of Representatives to a member of Congress, U.S. citizens born outside the United States and who have never lived, studied, or worked in the United States are effectively being denied access to financial services in the Netherlands. Focus group participants added that some banks will reject U.S. clients or charge heavy fees for them to open an account. Agencies have ongoing efforts to address FATCA-related issues, as listed below, but some are ad hoc, fragmented, or otherwise not part of a broader effort between Treasury and other agencies such as State or SSA to use ongoing collaborative mechanisms to monitor and share information on such issues, and jointly develop and implement steps to address them: Treasury officials said they are participating in discussions with FFIs to address residual issues with access to foreign financial services. However, they said they have not involved other agencies in these discussions. IRS officials, in response to concerns from the French government, said they are developing a program to help streamline foreign asset- related tax compliance requirements for a small group of U.S. born citizens that have been French residents most of their lives without an SSN, and—according to State officials—did not wish to take the necessary steps to renounce their citizenship. However, no effort has been made to address these issues more broadly. State encouraged U.S. citizens to alert the nearest U.S. embassy of any practices they encounter with regard to the provision of financial services. State documents noted that some Americans have been turned away by banks or required to meet a higher deposit threshold in part because of FATCA reporting requirements. State documentation also noted that there have been cases of U.S. citizens with existing bank accounts who have been asked to close them. However, State documentation we reviewed does not highlight collaborative efforts currently underway with Treasury or other agencies to address banking access issues U.S. persons living abroad are presently encountering worldwide. As described above, SSA and State streamlined processes and policies for U.S. persons abroad seeking to obtain SSNs. However, SSA officials said they have not been involved in any ongoing efforts involving Treasury to identify systemic issues and related solutions involving SSNs for the purposes of tax compliance and citizenship renunciations. Treasury officials said they spoke with SSA officials about problems U.S. persons living abroad face in obtaining SSNs, but SSA believed that cycle times for processing SSN applications submitted by U.S. persons living abroad were not significantly greater than for applications submitted by U.S. persons living in the United States, although mailing times could vary significantly and take up to 3 to 6 months. We have previously identified key practices to enhance and sustain interagency collaboration, including defining and articulating a common outcome, establishing mutually reinforcing or joint strategies, and developing mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and report on results. One goal in IRS’s strategic plan is to collaborate with external partners proactively to improve tax administration, while objectives in SSA’s strategic plan include improving service delivery and expanding service delivery options. Additionally, according to State’s Bureau of Consular Affairs website, one of State’s key priorities is to protect the interests of U.S. citizens overseas, such as through ensuring responsive and efficient provision of consular services overseas. As noted above, there are a host of ongoing issues and challenges for U.S. persons living abroad from implementation of FATCA, such as loss of access to foreign financial services, denial of employment and promotion opportunities overseas, and difficulty obtaining SSNs from abroad. However, Treasury currently lacks a collaborative mechanism to coordinate efforts with other agencies to address these issues, and Treasury officials said they do not plan to establish them. Without effective collaborative mechanisms to monitor and share information and implement cross-agency solutions, future efforts to address such issues will continue to be fragmented and less effective than they otherwise could be. In enacting FATCA, Congress sought to reduce tax evasion by creating greater transparency and accountability over offshore assets held by U.S. taxpayers. Because of FATCA, IRS receives information on foreign financial assets from hundreds of thousands of filers annually. IRS could use this information to help ensure taxpayers holding offshore assets report and pay taxes owed on income generated from such assets. However, to take full advantage of the information, IRS must address key challenges. Specifically, Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TIN) reported by FFIs are often inaccurate or incomplete, which makes it difficult for IRS to match information reported by FFIs to individual taxpayers. As such, IRS must develop a plan to mitigate the risks that these data issues pose to agency efforts to identify and combat taxpayer noncompliance. Lack of consistent, complete, and readily available Form 8938 and related parent individual tax return data also affects IRS’s compliance activities, making it more difficult for IRS business units to extract and analyze FATCA data to improve tax compliance efforts and reduce tax revenue loss from income generated from offshore assets. At the same time, IRS has stopped following its FATCA Compliance Roadmap it developed in 2016 because, according to IRS officials, IRS moved away from updating broad strategy documents to focus on individual compliance campaigns. However, in light of the challenges IRS continues to face in fully integrating FATCA information into its compliance programs, it will not maximize use of such information and effectively leverage individual compliance campaigns unless it employs a comprehensive plan that enables IRS to better leverage such campaigns to improve taxpayer compliance. Our analysis of available data indicates that many of the Forms 8938 filed in tax year 2016 may have been filed unnecessarily. Factors that are contributing to this unnecessary reporting are unclear. While IRS has provided instructions and guidance on its website for completing Form 8938, focus group participants and tax practitioners reported confusion on whether and how to report investments in foreign accounts. Taking steps to identify and address factors contributing to unnecessary Form 8938 reporting would help reduce taxpayer burden and reduce processing costs for IRS. Reporting requirements for foreign financial assets under FATCA overlap with reporting requirements under FBAR. These overlapping requirements—implemented under two different statutes—have resulted in most taxpayers filing Forms 8938 also filing FBARs with FinCEN. Duplicative filings on foreign financial assets cause confusion, frustration, and compliance burdens for taxpayers. Duplicative filings also increased costs to the government to process and store the same or similar information. Modifying the statutes governing the requirements can fully address the issues outlined above, and can allow for the use of FATCA information for prevention and detection of financial crimes. This is similar to other statutory allowances for IRS to disclose return information for other purposes, such as for determining Social Security income tax withholding. Lastly, FATCA has created challenges for some U.S. persons living abroad that go beyond increasing their tax compliance burdens. Some U.S. persons living abroad are still facing issues accessing financial services and employment and obtaining SSNs. Treasury, State, and SSA have taken some steps to address these issues both separately and in coordination with each other. However, Treasury, as the agency ultimately responsible for effective administration of FATCA, currently lacks a collaborative mechanism with State and SSA to address ongoing issues. Establishing a formal means to collaboratively address burdens faced by Americans abroad from FATCA can help agencies develop effective solutions to mitigate such burdens. We are making the following matter for congressional consideration: Congress should consider amending the Internal Revenue Code, Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, and other statutes, as needed, to address overlap in foreign financial asset reporting requirements for the purposes of tax compliance and detection, and prevention of financial crimes, such as by aligning the types of assets to be reported and asset reporting thresholds, and ensuring appropriate access to the reported information. We are making the following four recommendations to IRS: The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should develop a plan to mitigate risks with compliance activities due to the lack of accurate and complete TINs of U.S. account holders collected from FFIs. (Recommendation 1) The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should ensure that appropriate business units conducting compliance enforcement and research have access to consistent and complete data collected from individuals’ electronic and paper filings of Form 8938 and elements of parent individual tax returns. As part of this effort, the Commissioner should ensure that IRS provides clear guidance to the business units for accessing such data in IRS’s Compliance Data Warehouse. (Recommendation 2) The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should employ a comprehensive plan for managing efforts to leverage FATCA data in agency compliance efforts. The plan should document and track activities over time to ensure individuals and FFIs comply with FATCA reporting assess and mitigate data quality risks from FFIs; improve the quality, management, and accessibility of FATCA data for compliance, research, and other purposes; and establish, monitor, and evaluate compliance efforts involving FATCA data intended to improve voluntary compliance and address noncompliance with FATCA reporting requirements. (Recommendation 3) The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should assess factors contributing to unnecessary Form 8938 reporting and take steps, as appropriate, to address the issue. Depending on the results of the assessment, potential options may include: identifying and implementing steps to further clarify IRS Form 8938 instructions and related guidance on IRS’s website on determining what foreign financial assets to report, and how to calculate and report asset values subject to reporting thresholds; and conducting additional outreach to educate taxpayers on required reporting thresholds, including notifying taxpayers that may have unnecessarily filed an IRS Form 8938 to reduce such filings. (Recommendation 4) We are also making the following recommendation to Treasury: The Secretary of the Treasury should lead efforts, in coordination with the Secretary of State and Commissioner of Social Security, to establish a formal means to collaboratively address ongoing issues— including issues accessing financial services and employment and obtaining SSNs—that U.S. persons living abroad encounter from implementation of FATCA reporting requirements. (Recommendation 5) We are also making the following recommendation to State: The Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury and Commissioner of Social Security, should establish a formal means to collaboratively address ongoing issues—including issues accessing financial services and employment and obtaining SSNs—that U.S. persons living abroad encounter from implementation of FATCA reporting requirements. (Recommendation 6) We are also making the following recommendation to SSA: The Commissioner of Social Security, in coordination with the Secretaries of State and Treasury, should establish a formal means to collaboratively address ongoing issues—including issues accessing financial services and employment and obtaining SSNs—that U.S. persons living abroad encounter from implementation of FATCA reporting requirements. (Recommendation 7) We provided a draft of this report to the Secretaries of State and the Treasury, Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and Acting Commissioner of Social Security. IRS provided written comments that are summarized below and reprinted in appendix VI. IRS did not state whether it agreed or disagreed with our four recommendations but otherwise provided responses. Regarding our recommendation to develop a plan to mitigate risks with compliance activities due to the lack of accurate and complete TINs of U.S. account holders collected from FFIs (recommendation 1), IRS reiterated that it provided a transition period, through the end of 2019, for compliance with the TIN requirements for FFIs in countries with Model 1 IGAs with the United States. IRS also said that it continued to make progress on improving FATCA filing compliance, citing efforts such as initiating a campaign addressing FFIs that do not meet their compliance responsibilities. While these efforts may help IRS obtain more accurate and complete information from financial accounts, IRS did not specify how it will mitigate the ongoing hurdles it faces in matching accounts reported by FFIs without valid TINs to accounts reported by individual tax filers and ensure compliance. Regarding our recommendation that appropriate business units have access to consistent and complete data collected from Forms 8938 and tax returns filed by individuals (recommendation 2), IRS reiterated that RAAS has been working to obtain read-only access to the IPM database but that limited budgetary resources are delaying implementation. Enabling access to consistent and complete Form 8938 and tax return data would help IRS better target compliance initiatives and leverage limited available enforcement resources. While IRS continues to work on enabling access to IPM, it could still provide clear guidance to its business units for accessing Form 8938 and tax return data in IRS’s Compliance Data Warehouse, as we recommended. Regarding our recommendation to employ a comprehensive plan for managing efforts to leverage FATCA data in agency compliance efforts (recommendation 3), IRS said the resources that would be required to develop a comprehensive plan would be better spent on enforcement activities. While implementing enforcement activities could increase compliance with FATCA reporting requirements, it risks not maximizing the value of such efforts without a comprehensive plan to manage and address the myriad of challenges discussed in this report. Further, it is our belief that IRS’s failure to execute the FATCA roadmap is not justification for abandoning a strategic approach going forward. Regarding our recommendation to assess factors contributing to unnecessary Form 8938 reporting and take appropriate steps to address the issue (recommendation 4), IRS said it will continue to observe filings of Form 8938 and, to the extent that there are unnecessary filings, assess options to inform account holders to reduce reporting and filing burdens followed by appropriate steps to implement any selected options. Our analysis of available data indicates that many Forms 8938 may have been filed unnecessarily. Implementing our recommendation reduces the risk that taxpayers file—and IRS processes—forms unnecessarily. Treasury provided written comments but did not state whether it agreed or disagreed with our recommendation that it lead efforts, in coordination with State and SSA, to establish a formal means to collaboratively address ongoing issues that U.S. persons living abroad encounter from implementation of FATCA reporting requirements (recommendation 5). Treasury said it will work collaboratively with State and SSA to answer questions that Americans abroad have regarding their tax obligations and, where appropriate, to direct U.S. citizens to resources that will help them understand the procedures applied by SSA to apply for an SSN. However, Treasury said it is not the appropriate agency to lead coordination efforts involving foreign employment issues and issues regarding access to foreign financial services and obtaining SSNs. As we noted above, Treasury is ultimately responsible for effective administration of FATCA. As such, it is in a better position than State or SSA to adjust regulations and guidance implementing FATCA to address burdens FFIs and foreign employers face from FATCA implementation while ensuring tax compliance. Additionally, Treasury has an interest in helping U.S. persons receive valid SSNs from SSA in a timely manner to meet their tax obligations. Treasury’s written response is reprinted in appendix VII. State and SSA also provided written comments in which they concurred with our recommendations to establish a formal means to address collaboratively together with Treasury ongoing issues that U.S. persons living abroad encounter with FATCA (recommendations 6 and 7). State and SSA’s written comments are reprinted in appendices VIII and IX, respectively. Treasury, State, and SSA provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretaries of State and the Treasury, Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Acting Commissioner of Social Security, and other interested parties. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-9110 or mctiguej@gao.gov. Contact points for our offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs are on the last page of this report. GAO staff who contributed to this report are listed in appendix X. The objectives of this report are to (1) assess the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) efforts to use information collected under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) to improve taxpayer compliance; (2) examine available foreign financial asset reports submitted by U.S. persons, including submissions that were below required filing thresholds; (3) examine the extent to which the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) administers overlapping reporting requirements on foreign financial assets; (4) describe similarities and differences between FATCA and Common Reporting Standard (CRS) reporting requirements; and (5) examine the effects of FATCA implementation that are unique to U.S. persons living abroad. For our first objective, we reviewed Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reports and collected information from Treasury and IRS to summarize efforts to collect complete and valid Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TIN) from foreign financial institutions (FFI). We identified criteria from our prior work identifying key practices for risk management. The key practices are derived from the Software Engineering Institute’s Capability Maturity Model® Integration for Development and Office of Management and Budget guidance. We applied these criteria to assess steps IRS has taken to manage risks in not receiving complete and valid TIN information from FFIs. We also applied criteria from our prior work on use of documented frameworks to IRS documentation on FATCA compliance activities to determine the extent to which IRS implemented a comprehensive plan to maximize use of collected data to enforce compliance with FATCA. For our second objective, we identified total maximum account values reported by individual filers of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Form 114s (commonly known as the Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts, or FBAR) in calendar years 2015 and 2016. See appendix III for more details on our methodology to evaluate these data. We also summarized the numbers of IRS Forms 8938, Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets (Form 8938) filed in tax year 2016, accounting for the data limitations described below. We also identified Forms 8938 filed in tax year 2016—the most recent year for which data were available—with available residency and asset information that reported specified foreign financial assets with aggregate values at or below end-of-year tax thresholds, which vary depending on the location of residence and filing status of such filers. For our third objective, we reviewed IRS and FinCEN documentation, and applied criteria from Fragmentation, Overlap, and Duplication: An Evaluation and Management Guide to identify the extent to which IRS and FinCEN were engaged in overlapping activities, and collecting duplicative information on foreign financial assets held by U.S. persons. We assessed the extent to which individual filers who submitted a Form 8938 in 2015 and 2016 also submitted an FBAR for the same year by determining the number and percentage of Forms 8938 with TINs that also match the TIN listed on the corresponding FBAR for the same year. For the three objectives described above, we assessed the reliability of data submitted on Forms 8938 filed by individuals for tax years 2015 and 2016, the most recent data available. These data were extracted from IRS’s Individual Return Transaction File (IRTF) and Modernized Tax Return Database (MTRDB) through IRS’s Compliance Data Warehouse (CDW). We also assessed the reliability of data from FBARs for calendar years 2015 and 2016 by (1) reviewing documentation about the data and the systems that produced them; (2) conducting electronic tests, such as identifying data with significant numbers of missing Form 8938 or FBAR records, or values of foreign financial assets reported outside an expected range; (3) tracing selections or random samples of data to source documents; and (4) interviewing IRS and FinCEN officials knowledgeable about the data. We also reviewed Form 8938 and relevant parent tax return data stored in IRS databases to determine whether IRS management is using quality information collected from Forms 8938 to achieve its objectives, as defined in our Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government. We determined that data extracted from IRTF on characteristics of Form 8938 filers and from FBAR filings was sufficiently reliable for our purposes, subject to caveats identified in this report. However, we determined we could not obtain complete data on foreign financial assets reported on Forms 8938 filed on paper. For our fourth objective, we reviewed model international agreements and other documentation, and interviewed officials from Treasury, IRS, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to compare and contrast FATCA and CRS reporting requirements. We also used the collected information to identify what changes, if any, the United States and other countries could implement to align FATCA and CRS reporting requirements. For our fifth objective, we collected documentation and conducted focus groups and semi-structured interviews with 21 U.S. persons living abroad that were subject to FATCA reporting requirements. We also conducted focus groups and interviews with tax practitioners, banking and CPA organizations, government agencies, advocacy groups representing Americans living abroad, and other organizations from the United States and five other countries (Canada, Japan, Singapore, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom). We selected these countries based on geography, relatively high numbers of U.S. expatriates and Form 8938 filers, tax information sharing agreements, and other tax treaties with the United States. The findings from the focus groups and interviews are not generalizable to other U.S. persons, tax practitioners or organizations, but were selected to represent the viewpoints of U.S. persons, FFIs, and host country tax authorities required to transmit information on foreign accounts and other specified foreign financial assets to IRS. We conducted a thematic analysis of the focus groups and interviews, and reviewed cables from U.S. embassies to identify the unique effects of FATCA implementation on U.S. persons living abroad. We collected documentation from and interviewed Treasury, IRS, Department of State, and Social Security Administration officials on steps to monitor and mitigate such effects. We also identified criteria from our prior work on key practices to enhance and sustain interagency collaboration and mechanisms to facilitate coordination. We applied the criteria to agencies’ collaborative efforts addressing issues U.S. persons living abroad faced from FATCA’s implementation, and identified the extent to which agencies established effective collaborative mechanisms to identify, assess, and implement cross-agency solutions to such issues. We conducted this performance audit from August 2017 to April 2019 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. The following IRS databases store data collected from individuals’ electronic and paper filings of Forms 8938 and/or elements of individual parent tax returns—the filer’s address and filing status—used to determine specified reporting thresholds for Form 8938 filers: Individual Master File (IMF), which serves as IRS’s system for processing individual taxpayer account data. Using this system, accounts are updated, taxes are assessed, and refunds are generated as required during each tax-filing period. Individual Returns Transaction File (IRTF), which stores edited, transcribed, and error-corrected data from the Form 1040 series and related forms for the current processing year and two prior years. Modernized Tax Return Database (MTRDB), which serves as the official repository of all electronic returns processed through IRS’s Modernized e-File system. Tax return data is stored immediately after returns are processed. International Compliance Management Model (ICMM)-FATCA International Returns (ICMM-FIR), which collects, parses, and stores data from incoming form reports–such as Forms 8938 and 8966–into the FATCA Database (FDB), which serves as the repository where ICMM-FIR stores data and from which downstream applications can pull data. Integrated Production Model (IPM), which is a downstream data repository that houses IMF data, information returns, and other data. According to IRS officials, data from IPM are consolidated and made available to a variety of downstream, security certified, systems for use in conducive analysis, case selection, and report preparation. Additionally, data from these and other IRS databases are copied to IRS’s Compliance Data Warehouse (CDW) periodically, which captures data from multiple production systems and organizes the data in a way that is conductive to analysis. Table 6 highlights several problems with the consistency and completeness of Form 8938 and relevant parent tax return data stored across the listed databases. Inconsistent and incomplete data on address and filing status of Form 8938 filers: As noted above, elements of parent tax returns— specifically the filer’s country of residence and filing status—are used to determine specified reporting thresholds for Form 8938 filers. However, IRTF and MTRDB have inconsistent and incomplete data on addresses linked to Form 8938 filers, and report inconsistent numbers of Forms 8938 filed from a U.S. residence. For example, the variable identified as containing data on foreign countries of residence in IRTF shows approximately 8,100 foreign filers in tax years 2015 and 2016, whereas a similar variable in MTRDB shows approximately 89,000 foreign filers for those same years. Additionally, FDB does not contain country codes from paper filings of Form 8938. ICCM-FIR stores information from some elements from parent tax returns—such as TINs and document locator numbers. According to IRS officials, however, ICMM-FIR lacks data on country codes and filing status of Form 8938 filers. IRS officials said that ICMM-FIR was not designed or intended to store data on Form 8938 filers; rather, it was designed to be a database for use in comparing Form 8938 and 8966 data. In general, IRS officials indicated that they would like to adjust the way ICMM-FIR stores data, but that would require modifying the way the database was established. Incomplete data on assets reported on Forms 8938: MTRDB contains detailed information on specified foreign financial assets submitted on electronic filings of Form 8938 and the country code from which the Form 8938 was filed. IRS officials said it is not designed to store information submitted on paper filings of Forms 8938 and parent tax returns. IRS officials said that while IMF processes information transcribed from individual income tax returns, there is no requirement to cross-reference information from the tax return with information submitted with an accompanying Form 8938. Additionally, while IRS officials told us that IRTF is the authoritative source for filers of Form 8938, it does not store account and other asset information submitted from Forms 8938. When asked whether there is any move to store account and other asset information collected from Forms 8938 into IRTF, IRS officials said that the decision on what returns or portions of returns are transcribed are subject to resource constraints and are prioritized from year to year. Table 7 shows that more than 900,000 individuals filed Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Form 114s (commonly known as the Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts, or FBAR) in calendar years 2015 and 2016, and declared total maximum values of accounts ranging from about $1.5 trillion to more than $2 trillion each year. We are providing a range of estimates because we found a large number of filings made potentially in error. In some cases, for instance, FBAR filers reported more than $100 trillion in foreign financial accounts. We assume many of these filings are likely made in error, but have only limited means to determine which filings have errors, and which filings have accurate information. Because we cannot independently verify the accuracy of all self-reported FBAR data, we decided to present a range of data with (1) a lower bound discarding all FBAR filings reporting total values of reported foreign financial accounts at or above $1 billion; and (2) an upper bound discarding all filings reporting total values of such accounts at or above $5 billion. Table 2 excludes amended and duplicated FBAR filings. This table also excludes FBAR filings that reported a financial interest in 25 or more financial accounts, but reported total maximum account values of $0 from parts II and III of the FBAR. Although we identified problems with the data, we determined they were reliable enough to provide an estimated range of asset values to report the scale of foreign financial accounts held by U.S. persons. Table 8 shows a detailed breakdown of 2015 and 2016 FBAR filings by residence and categories of total maximum account values reported on the FBARs. Appendix IV: Detailed Comparison of Individual Foreign Financial Asset Reporting Requirements 26 U.S.C. § 6038D; 26 C.F.R. §§ 1.6038D-1 to 1.6038D-8. 26 C.F.R. § 1.6038D-2. Filers in this category include those who identify as single, married filing separately, “head of household,” or “qualifying widow(er).” Includes maximum value of specified foreign financial assets (Form 8938) or maximum value of financial accounts maintained by a financial institution physically located in a foreign country (FBAR). Under FATCA, any income, gains, losses, deductions, credits, gross proceeds, or distributions from holding or disposing of the account are or would be required to be reported, included, or otherwise reflected on a person’s income tax return. Under FBAR reporting requirements, a person has signature or other authority if he or she has the authority (alone or in conjunction with another) to control the disposition of money, funds or other assets held in a financial account by direct communication (whether in writing or otherwise) to the person with whom the financial account is maintained. The account itself is subject to reporting, but the contents of the account do not have to be separately reported.

Stephens, and Elwood White made key contributions to this report.

House Report 114-624 included a provision for GAO to evaluate FATCA implementation and determine the effects of FATCA on U.S. citizens living abroad. GAO—among other things—(1) assessed IRS's efforts to use FATCA-related information to improve taxpayer compliance; (2) examined the extent to which Treasury administers overlapping reporting requirements on financial assets held overseas; and (3) examined the effects of FATCA implementation unique to U.S. persons living abroad. GAO reviewed applicable documentation; analyzed tax data; and interviewed officials from IRS, other federal agencies and organizations, selected tax practitioners, and more than 20 U.S. persons living overseas. Data quality and management issues have limited the effectiveness of the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) efforts to improve taxpayer compliance using foreign financial asset data collected under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). Specifically, IRS has had difficulties matching the information reported by foreign financial institutions (FFI) with U.S. taxpayers' tax filings due to missing or inaccurate Taxpayer Identification Numbers provided by FFIs. Further, IRS lacks access to consistent and complete data on foreign financial assets and other data reported in tax filings by U.S. persons, in part, because some IRS databases do not store foreign asset data reported from paper filings. IRS has also stopped pursuing a comprehensive plan to leverage FATCA data to improve taxpayer compliance because, according to IRS officials, IRS moved away from updating broad strategy documents to focus on individual compliance campaigns. Ensuring access to consistent and complete data collected from U.S. persons—and employing a plan to leverage such data—would help IRS better leverage such campaigns and increase taxpayer compliance. Due to overlapping statutory reporting requirements, IRS and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)—both within the Department of the Treasury (Treasury)—collect duplicative foreign financial account and other asset information from U.S. persons. Consequently, in tax years 2015 and 2016, close to 75 percent of U.S. persons who reported information on foreign accounts and other assets on their tax returns also filed a separate form with FinCEN. The overlapping requirements increase the compliance burden on U.S. persons and add complexity that can create confusion, potentially resulting in inaccurate or unnecessary reporting. Modifying the statutes governing the requirements to allow for the sharing of FATCA information for the prevention and detection of financial crimes would eliminate the need for duplicative reporting. This is similar to other statutory allowances for IRS to disclose return information for other purposes, such as for determining Social Security income tax withholding. According to documents GAO reviewed, and focus groups and interviews GAO conducted, FFIs closed some U.S. persons' existing accounts or denied them opportunities to open new accounts after FATCA was enacted due to increased costs, and risks they pose under FATCA reporting requirements. According to Department of State (State) data, annual approvals of renunciations of U.S. citizenship increased from 1,601 to 4,449—or nearly 178 percent—from 2011 through 2016, attributable in part to the difficulties cited above. Treasury previously established joint strategies with State to address challenges U.S. persons faced in accessing foreign financial services. However, it lacks a collaborative mechanism to coordinate efforts with other agencies to address ongoing challenges in accessing such services or obtaining Social Security Numbers. Implementation of a formal means to collaboratively address burdens faced by Americans abroad from FATCA can help federal agencies develop more effective solutions to mitigate such burdens by monitoring and sharing information on such issues, and jointly developing and implementing steps to address them. GAO is making one matter for congressional consideration to address overlap in foreign asset reporting requirements. GAO is making seven recommendations to IRS and other agencies to enhance IRS's ability to leverage FATCA data to enforce compliance, address unnecessary reporting, and better collaborate to mitigate burdens on U.S. persons living abroad. State and Social Security Administration agreed with GAO's recommendations. Treasury and IRS neither agreed nor disagreed with GAO's recommendations.""]","13388","gov_report","en","None","21a88b8ac5c42a6f566eadadaeaf2f727d9d01024b2dcd3b","Summary:","gov_report","532","\n\nThe United States has"

Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nThis report provides background information and potential oversight issues for Congress on war-related and other international emergency or contingency-designated funding since FY2001. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress has appropriated approximately $2 trillion in discretionary budget authority designated for emergencies or OCO/GWOT in support of the broad U.S. government response to the 9/11 attacks and for other related international affairs activities. This figure includes $1.8 trillion for the Department of Defense (DOD), $154 billion for the Department of State and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and $3 billion for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Coast Guard (see Figure 1 ). This CRS report is meant to serve as a reference on certain funding designated as emergency requirement s or for Overseas Contingency Ope rations/Global War on Terrorism (OCO/GWOT), as well as related budgetary and policy issues. It does not provide an estimate of war costs within the OCO/GWOT account (all of which may not be for activities associated with war or defense) or such costs in the DOD base budget or other agency funding (which may be related to war activities, such as the cost of health care for combat veterans).

Congress may consider one or more supplemental appropriations bills (colloquially called supplementals) for a fiscal year to provide funding for unforeseen needs (such as a response to a national security threat or a natural disaster), or to increase appropriations for other activities that have already been funded. Supplemental appropriations measures generally provide additional funding for selected activities over and above the amount provided through annual or continuing appropriations. Throughout the 20 th century, Congress relied on supplemental appropriations to fund war-related activities, particularly in the period immediately following the start of hostilities. For example, in 1951, a year after the start of the Korean War, Congress approved DOD supplemental appropriations totaling $32.8 billion ($268 billion in constant FY2019 dollars). In 1952, DOD supplemental appropriations totaled just $1.4 billion ($11 billion in constant FY2019), as the base budget incorporated costs related to the war effort. A similar pattern occurred, to varying degrees, during the Vietnam War and 1990-1991 Gulf War. During the post-9/11 conflicts, primarily conducted in Afghanistan and Iraq but also in other countries, Congress has, for an extended period and to a much greater degree than in previous conflicts in the 20 th century, appropriated supplemental and specially designated funding over and above the base DOD budget—that is, funding for planned or regularly occurring costs to man, train, and equip the military force. Since FY2001, DOD funding designated for OCO/GWOT has averaged 17% of the department's total budget authority (see Figure 2 ). By comparison, during the conflict in Vietnam—the only other to last more than a decade—DOD funding designated for non-base activities averaged 6% of the department's total budget authority. Supplemental appropriations can provide flexibility for policymakers to address demands that arise after funding has been appropriated. However, that flexibility has caused some to question whether supplementals should only be used to respond to unforeseen events, or whether they should also provide funding for activities that could reasonably be covered in regular appropriations acts. Congress used supplemental appropriations to provide funds for defense and foreign affairs activities related to operations in Afghanistan and Iraq following 9/11, and each subsequent fiscal year through FY2010. Initially understood as reflecting needs that were not anticipated during the regular appropriations cycle, supplemental appropriations were generally enacted as requested, and almost always designated as emergency requirements. Beginning in FY2004, DOD received some of its war-related funding in its regular annual appropriations; these funds were designated as emergency. When funding needs for war and non-war-related activities were higher than anticipated, the Bush Administration submitted supplemental requests. In the FY2011 appropriations cycle, the Obama Administration moved away from submitting supplemental appropriations requests to Congress for war-related activities and used the regular budget and appropriation process to fund operations. This approach implied that while the funds might be war-related, they largely supported predictable ongoing activities rather than unanticipated needs. In concert with this change in budgetary approach, the Obama Administration began formally using the term Overseas Contingency Op erations in place of the Bush Administration's term Global War on Terror . Both the Obama and Trump Administrations requested that OCO funding be designated in a manner that would effectively exempt such funding from the BCA limits on discretionary defense spending. Currently, there is no overall procedural or statutory limit on the amount of emergency or OCO/GWOT-designated spending that may be appropriated on an annual basis. Both Congress and the President have roles in determining how much emergency or OCO/GWOT spending is provided to federal agencies each fiscal year. Such spending must be designated as such within the President's budget request for congressional consideration. The President must separately designate the spending after Congress enacts appropriations for it to be available for expenditure. The emergency funding designation predated the OCO/GWOT designation. Through definitions statutorily established by the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA; P.L. 99-177 ), spending designated as emergency requirements is for ""unanticipated"" purposes, such as those that are ""sudden ... urgent ... unforeseen ... and temporary."" The BBEDCA does not further specify the types of activities that are eligible for that designation. Thus, any discretionary funding designated by Congress and the President as being for an emergency is effectively exempted from certain statutory and procedural budget enforcement mechanisms, such as the BCA limits on discretionary spending. Debate of what should constitute OCO/GWOT or emergency activities and expenses has shifted over time, reflecting differing viewpoints about the extent, nature, and duration of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere. Over the years, both Congress and the President have at times adopted more, and at times less, expansive definitions of such designations to accommodate the strategic, budgetary, and political needs of the moment. Prior to February 2009, U.S. operations in response to the 9/11 attacks were collectively referred to as the Global War on Terror , or GWOT. Between September 2001 and February 2009, there was no separate budgetary designation for GWOT funds—instead, funding associated with those operations was designated as an emergency requirement. The term OCO was not applied to the post-9/11 military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan until 2009. In February 2009, the Obama Administration released A New Era of Responsibili ty: Renewing America's Promise , a presidential fiscal policy document. That document did not mention or reference GWOT; instead, it used the term OCO in reference to ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The first request for emergency funding for OCO—not GWOT—was delivered to Congress in April 2009. Since the FY2010 budget cycle, DOD has requested both base budget and OCO funding as part of its annual budget submission to Congress. Beginning with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (NDAA; P.L. 111-84 ), the annual defense authorization bills have referenced the authorization of additional appropriations for OCO rather than the names of U.S. military operations conducted primarily in Afghanistan and Iraq. In 2011, the BCA ( P.L. 112-125 ) amended the BBEDCA to create the Overseas Contingency Ope rations/Global War on Terrorism designation, which provided Congress and the President with an alternate way to exempt funding from the BCA caps without using the emergency designation. Beginning with the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 ( P.L. 112-74 ), annual appropriations bills have referenced the OCO/GWOT designation. The foreign affairs agencies began formally requesting OCO/GWOT funding in FY2012, distinguishing between what is referred to as enduring, ongoing or base costs versus any extraordinary, temporary costs of the State Department and USAID in supporting ongoing U.S. operations and policies in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Congress, having used OCO/GWOT exemption for DOD, adopted this approach for foreign affairs, though its uses for State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) activities have never been permanently defined in statute. For the first foreign affairs OCO/GWOT appropriation, in FY2012, funds were provided for a wide range of recipient countries beyond the countries in the President's request, including Yemen, Somalia, Kenya, and the Philippines. In addition to country-specific uses, OCO/GWOT-designated funds were also appropriated for the Global Security Contingency Fund. All budgetary legislation is subject to a set of enforcement procedures associated with the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 ( P.L. 93-344 ), as well as other rules, such as those imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011 ( P.L. 112-125 ) as amended. Those rules provide mechanisms to enforce both procedural and statutory limits on discretionary spending. Enacted on August 2, 2011, the BCA as amended sets limits on defense and nondefense spending. As part of an agreement to increase the statutory limit on public debt, the BCA aimed to reduce annual federal budget deficits by a total of at least $2.1 trillion from FY2012 through FY2021, with approximately half of the savings to come from defense. The spending limits (or caps ) apply separately to defense and nondefense discretionary budget authority. The caps are enforced by a mechanism called sequestration . Sequestration automatically cancels previously enacted appropriations (a form of budget authority) by an amount necessary to reach prespecified levels. The BCA effectively exempted certain types of discretionary spending from the statutory limits, including funding designated for OCO/GWOT. As a result, Congress and the President have designated funding for OCO to support activities that, in previous times, had been funded within the base budget. This was done, in part, as a response to the discretionary spending limits enacted by the BCA. By designating funding for OCO for certain activities not directly related to contingency operations, Congress and the President can effectively continue to increase topline defense, foreign affairs, and other related discretionary spending without triggering sequestration. Congress has repeatedly amended the legislation to raise the spending limits (thus lowering its deficit-reduction effect by corresponding amounts). Congress has passed four bills that revised the automatic spending caps initially established by the BCA, including the following: American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA; P.L. 112-240 ); Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (BBA 2013; P.L. 113-67 ); Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 2015; P.L. 114-74 ); and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018; P.L. 115-123 ). On February 9, 2018, three days before President Donald Trump submitted his FY2019 budget request, Congress passed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018, P.L. 115-123 ). The act raised the discretionary spending limits set by the BCA from $1.069 trillion for FY2017 to $1.208 trillion for FY2018 and to $1.244 trillion for FY2019. The BBA 2018 increased FY2019 discretionary defense funding levels (excluding OCO) by the largest amounts to date—$85 billion, from $562 billion to $647 billion, and nondefense funding (including SFOPS) by $68 billion, from $529 billion to $597 billion. It did not change discretionary spending limits for FY2020 and FY2021. DOD documents indicate the department in recent years has used OCO funding for activities viewed as unrelated to war. For example, the department's FY2019 budget request estimates $358 billion in OCO funding from FY2015 through FY2019. Of that amount, DOD categorizes $68 billion (19%) for activities unrelated to operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. These activities are described as ""EDI/Non-War,"" referring in part to the European Deterrence Initiative, and ""Base-to-OCO,"" referring to OCO funding used for base-budget requirements. Similarly, a DOD Cost of War report from June 2018 shows $1.8 trillion in war-related appropriations from FY2001 through FY2018 for operations primarily conducted in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. Of that total, DOD categorizes $219 billion (12%) as other than ""war funds."" These funds are described as ""Classified,"" ""Modularity,"" ""Fuel (non-war),"" ""Noble Eagle (Base),"" and ""Non-War."" International affairs agencies also began increasing the share of their budgets designated for OCO, and applying the designation to an increasing range of activities apparently unrelated to conflicts. OCO as a share of the international affairs budget grew from about 21% in FY2012 to nearly 35% in FY2017. Unlike DOD, however, the State Department and USAID have not specified whether any OCO-designated funds are considered part of the agencies' base budgets. According to a DOD budget document from FY2016, the Obama Administration planned to ""transition all enduring costs currently funded in the OCO budget to the base budget beginning in 2017 and ending by 2020."" The plan was to describe ""which OCO costs should endure as the United States shifts from major combat operations, how the Administration will budget for the uncertainty surrounding unforeseen future crises, and the implications for the base budgets of DOD, the Intelligence Community, and State/OIP. This transition will not be possible if the sequester-level discretionary spending caps remain in place."" The BCA remained in effect and OCO funding was used for base-budget requirements. Some defense officials and policymakers say OCO funding enables a flexible and timely response to an emergency or contingency and provides a political and fiscal safety valve to the BCA caps and threat of sequestration. They say if OCO funding were not used in such a manner and discretionary spending limits remained in place, DOD and other federal agencies would be forced to cut base budgets and revise strategic priorities. For example, former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has said if Congress allows the FY2020 and FY2021 defense spending caps to take effect, the 2018 National Defense Strategy, which calls for the United States to bolster its military advantage against potential competitors such as Russia and China, ""is not sustainable."" Critics, including Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, have described the OCO account as a ""slush fund"" for military and foreign affairs spending unrelated to contingency operations. Mulvaney, former director of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), has described the use of OCO funding for base budget requirements as ""budget gimmicks."" Critics argue what was once generally restricted to a fund for replacing combat losses of equipment, resupplying expended munitions, transporting troops to and through war zones, and distributing foreign aid to frontline states has ""ballooned into an ambiguous part of the budget to which government financiers increasingly turn to pay for other, at times unrelated, costs."" OMB criteria for OCO funding include the combat losses of ground vehicles, aircraft, and other equipment; replenishment of munitions expended in combat operations; facilities and infrastructure in the theater of operations; transport of personnel, equipment, and supplies to and from the theater; among other items and activities. Determining which activities are directly related, tangentially related, or unrelated to war operations is often a point of debate. Some have questioned the use of OCO funding to purchase F-35 fighter jets: ""It is jumping the shark.... There's no pretense that it has anything to do with the region."" Others have argued it makes sense for the military to use OCO funding to purchase new aircraft to replace planes used in current conflicts and no longer in production: ""What are the conditions that are making the combatant commanders and those with train/equip authority to say, 'We need more of this?'"" Congress has appropriated approximately $2 trillion in discretionary budget authority for war-related and other international emergency or contingency-designated activities since 9/11. This figure is a CRS estimate of funding designated for emergencies or OCO/GWOT in support of the broad U.S. government response to the 9/11 attacks, as well as other foreign affairs activities, from FY2001 through FY2019. This includes $1.8 trillion for DOD, $154 billion for the Department of State and USAID, and $3 billion for DHS and the Coast Guard (see Table 1 ). These figures do not include emergency-designated funding appropriated in this period for domestic programs, such as disaster response. From FY2001 through FY2009, DOD received $1.8 trillion in appropriations for OCO/GWOT, or approximately 17% of the department's total discretionary budget authority of $10.8 trillion during the period. The department's OCO/GWOT funding peaked in FY2008 both in terms of nominal dollars, at $186.9 billion, and as a share of its discretionary budget, at 28.1% (see Figure 3 ), after the Bush Administration surged additional U.S. military personnel to Iraq. The department's OCO funding also increased as a share of its discretionary spending from FY2009 to FY2010 following the Obama Administration's deployment of more U.S. military personnel to Afghanistan, and again in FY2017 following enactment of legislation in response to the Trump Administration's request for additional appropriations. In FY2019, the department's OCO/GWOT funding totaled $68.8 billion, or 10% of its discretionary spending. In terms of appropriations titles, more than two-thirds of OCO/GWOT funding since FY2001 has been for Operation and Maintenance (O&M)—nearly double the percentage of base budget funding for O&M over the same period (see Figure 4 ). O&M funds pay for the operating costs of the military such as fuel, maintenance to repair facilities and equipment, and the mobilization of forces. DOD describes ""war-related operational costs"" as operations, training, overseas facilities and base support, equipment maintenance, communications, and replacement of combat losses and enhancements. In terms of the military services, more than half (55%) of OCO/GWOT funding since FY2001 has gone to the Army—more than double the percentage of base budget funding for the service during this period (see Figure 5 ). Emergency appropriations were initially provided as general ""defense-wide"" appropriations. Beginning in FY2003, as operations evolved and planning developed, allocations increased and were specifically provided for the services. OCO funding for DOD has not decreased at the same rate as the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria has decreased. For example, the number of U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria decreased from a peak of 187,000 personnel in FY2008 (including 148,000 in Iraq and 39,000 in Afghanistan) to an assumed level of nearly 18,000 personnel in FY2019 (including 11,958 personnel in Afghanistan and 5,765 personnel in Iraq and Syria)—a decline of approximately 169,000 personnel (90%). Meanwhile, OCO funding decreased from a peak of $187 billion in FY2008 to $69 billion in FY2019—a decline of approximately $118 billion (63%). While the number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria has decreased since FY2009, the number of U.S. troops deployed or stationed elsewhere to support those personnel has fallen by a lesser degree and, in recent years, remained relatively steady. For example, the number of support forces—that is, personnel from units and forces operating outside of Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and other countries (including those stationed in the continental United States or otherwise mobilized) decreased from 112,000 personnel in FY2009 to an assumed level of 76,073 personnel in FY2019—a decline of 35,927 personnel (32%). In addition, when these support forces are combined with in-country force levels, the total force level decreases by a percentage more similar to the OCO budget, from 297,000 personnel in FY2009 to an assumed level of 93,796 personnel in FY2019—a decline of 203,204 personnel (68%) (see Figure 6 ). Some of these support forces serve in U.S. Central Command's area of responsibility, which includes 20 countries in West Asia, North Africa, and Central Asia, and whose forward headquarters is based in Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. According to DOD, the reason OCO funding has not fallen in proportion to the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria is ""due to the fixed, and often inelastic, costs of infrastructure, support requirements, and in-theater presence to support contingency operations."" For example, in FY2019, the department requested $20 billion in OCO funding for ""in-theater support""—nearly 30% of the OCO request and more than any other functional category. However, some analysts have noted the U.S. military's fixed costs in Afghanistan remained relatively stable at roughly $7 billion a year from FY2005 through FY2013 until after the BCA went into effect—and have since increased to roughly $32 billion a year, suggesting ""that roughly $25 billion in 'enduring' or base budget costs migrated into the Afghanistan budget, effectively circumventing the budget caps. The actual funding needed for operations in Afghanistan is roughly $20 billion in FY2019."" Title 10, Section 101, of the United States Code, defines a contingency operation as any Secretary of Defense-designated military operation ""in which members of the armed forces are or may become involved in military actions, operations, or hostilities against an enemy of the United States or against an opposing military force."" Since the 1990s NATO intervention in the Balkans, DOD Financial Management Regulations (FMR) have defined contingency operations costs as those expenses necessary to cover incremental costs ""that would not have been incurred had the contingency operation not been supported."" Such incremental costs would not include, for example, base pay for troops or planned equipment modernization, as those expenditures are normal peacetime needs of the DOD. In September 2010, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in collaboration with DOD, issued criteria for the department to use in making war/overseas contingency operations funding requests (see Appendix A ). In January 2017, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) concluded the criteria for deciding whether items belong in the base budget or OCO funding ""are outdated and do not address the full scope of activities"" in the budget request. ""For example, they do not address geographic areas such as Syria and Libya, where DOD has begun military operations; DOD's deterrence and counterterrorism initiatives; or requests for OCO funding to support requirements not related to ongoing contingency operations"" it states. Section 1524 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 ( P.L. 115-91 ), directed the Secretary of Defense to ""update the guidelines regarding the budget items that may be covered by overseas contingency operations accounts."" Congress has enacted legislation directing DOD to compile reports on the costs of certain contingency operations. Section 1266 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 ( P.L. 115-91 ) directs the Secretary of Defense to submit the Department of Defense Supplemental and Cost of War Execution report, known as the Cost of War report, on a quarterly basis to the congressional defense committees and the GAO: ""Not later than 45 days after the end of each fiscal year quarter, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense committees and the Comptroller General of the United States the Department of Defense Supplemental and Cost of War Execution report for such fiscal year quarter."" The conference report accompanying the Department of Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act, 2019 and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 115-245 ) requires DOD to report incremental costs for operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other countries in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility and directs: the Secretary of Defense to continue to report incremental costs for all named operations in the Central Command Area of Responsibility on a quarterly basis and to submit, also on a quarterly basis, commitment, obligation, and expenditure data for the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund, the Counter-Islamic State of Iraq and Syria Train and Equip Fund, and for all security cooperation programs funded under the Defense Security Cooperation Agency in the Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide Account. DOD's June 2018 Cost of War report to Congress details $1.5 trillion in obligations associated with certain contingency operations from FY2001 through FY2018. That figure includes $757.1 billion for those conducted primarily in Iraq—Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), Operation New Dawn (OND), and Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR); $727.7 billion for those conducted primarily in Afghanistan—Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS); and $27.8 billion for those conducted primarily in the United States (see Table 2 and Figure 7 ). DOD's quarterly Cost of War reports are intended to provide Congress, GAO, and other stakeholders insight into the how the department obligates war-related appropriations. The reports include base and OCO obligations related to war activities, as well as obligation data broken down by certain major operations, service, component, agency, and appropriation. However, as GAO has noted, ""the proportion of OCO appropriations not associated with specific operations identified in the statutory Cost of War reporting requirement has trended upward"" in part because the criteria DOD uses for making OCO funding requests is outdated and not always used. More recently, the June 2018 Cost of War report does not appear to reference three recently classified overseas contingency operations targeting militants affiliated with al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS): Operation Yukon Journey in the Middle East, Northwest Africa Counterterrorism, and East Africa Counterterrorism. Some observers have noted other limitations to Cost of War reports, such as incomplete accounting of costs, limited distribution of the documents and underlying data, and formatting that makes it difficult to reconcile the data with information contained in budget justification documents. Between FY2001 and FY2018, Congress appropriated a total of $154 billion in OCO funds for State Department and USAID. For FY2018 (the most recent full-year appropriations for foreign affairs agencies), OCO funding amounted to 22% of the total appropriations for State Department, Foreign Operations and Related Programs appropriation. The Obama Administration's FY2012 International Affairs budget request was the first to include a request for OCO funds for ""extraordinary and temporary costs of operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan."" At the time, the Administration indicated that the use of this designation was intended to provide a transparent, whole-of-government approach to the exceptional war-related costs incurred in those three countries, thus better aligning the associated military and civilian costs. This first foreign affairs OCO request identified the significant resource demands placed on the State Department as a result of the transitions from military-led to civilian-led missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the importance of a stable Pakistan for the U.S. effort in Afghanistan. The FY2012 foreign affairs OCO request included: for Iraq, funding for the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, consulates throughout Iraq, security costs in light of the then-planned U.S. military withdrawal, a then-planned civilian-led Police Development and Criminal Justice Program, military and development assistance in Iraq, and oversight of U.S. foreign assistance through the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction; for Afghanistan, funding to strengthen the Afghan government and build institutional capacity, support State/USAID and other U.S. government agency civilians deployed in Afghanistan, provide short-term economic assistance to address counterinsurgency and stabilization efforts, and provide oversight of U.S. foreign assistance programs in Afghanistan through the Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction; and for Pakistan, funding to support U.S. diplomatic presence and diplomatic security in Pakistan, provide Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Funds (PCCF) to train and equip Pakistani forces to eliminate insurgent sanctuaries and promote stability and security in neighboring Afghanistan and the region. In subsequent years, the Administration designated certain State Department activities in Syria and other peacekeeping activities as OCO, and Congress accepted and broadened this expanded use of OCO in annual appropriations. In the FY2017 budget request, the Administration further broadened its use of State OCO funds, applying the designation to funds for countering Russian aggression, counterterrorism, humanitarian assistance, and aid to Africa. In addition to OCO funds requested through the normal appropriations process, the Administration in recent years requested emergency supplemental funding (designated as OCO) to support State/USAID efforts in countering the Islamic State and to respond to global health threats such as the Ebola and Zika viruses. For FY2019, the Trump Administration requested no OCO/GWOT funding for the Department of State and USAID, although the FY2019 House and Senate SFOPS bills ( H.R. 6385 and S. 3108 , 115 th Congress) would have appropriated approximately $8 billion in OCO-designated funding for various priorities. The estimated $154.1 billion in emergency and OCO/GWOT appropriations enacted to date for State/USAID includes major non-war-related programs, such as aid for the 2004 tsunami along Indian Ocean coasts, 2010 earthquake in Haiti, 2013 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, and 2015 worldwide outbreak of the Zika virus; as well as diplomatic operations (e.g., paying staff, providing security, and building and maintaining embassies). OCO/GWOT has also funded a variety of foreign aid programs, ranging from the Economic Support Fund to counter-narcotics in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq, among other activities in other countries. Figure 8 depicts the emergency or OCO appropriations for foreign affairs activities. Since 2012, when the OCO designation was first used for foreign affairs, more OCO funds have been appropriated than were requested each year, and those have also been authorized to be used in additional countries. Since January 2002, approximately $3 billion of post-9/11 emergency and OCO-designated funding has been provided to the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) for its traditional homeland security missions and for USCG operations in support of U.S. Navy activities. This funding has been provided at various times as either an appropriation to the Coast Guard's operating expenses accounts, or as a transfer from Navy accounts to the Coast Guard. Open-source information on the use of those funds has varied. One FY2009 supplemental appropriations request included funding as a transfer, with the intent of funding ""Coast Guard operations in support of OIF and OEF, as well as other classified activities."" The FY2017 OCO request for annual appropriations for Navy Operations and Maintenance included $163 million for Coast Guard operational support for the deployment of patrol boats to the Northern Arabian Gulf and a port security unit to Guantanamo Bay, among other pay and equipment expenses. The Trump Administration initially requested a total of $89 billion in OCO funding for FY2019. All the funding was requested by DOD. In an amendment to the budget after Congress raised the BCA spending caps as part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018; P.L. 115-123 ), the Administration removed the OCO designation from $20 billion of the funding, in effect, shifting that amount into the DOD base budget request. In a statement on the budget amendment, Mulvaney said the request fixes ""long-time budget gimmicks"" in which OCO funding has been used for base budget requirements. Beginning in FY2020, ""the Administration proposes returning to OCO's original purpose by shifting certain costs funded in OCO to the base budget where they belong,"" he wrote. Of the revised amount of $69 billion requested for DOD OCO funding in FY2019: $46.3 billion (67%) was for Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS) in Afghanistan and related missions; $13 billion (22%) for Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) in Iraq and Syria and related missions; $4.8 billion (9%) for the European Deterrence Initiative (EDI) to boost the U.S. military presence in eastern Europe to deter Russian military aggression; and $0.9 billion (1%) for security cooperation (see Figure 9 ). The FY2019 OCO budget assumes a total force level (average annual troop strength) of 93,796 personnel. That figure includes: 11,958 primarily in Afghanistan (OFS); 5,765 primarily in Iraq and Syria (OIR); 59,463 for in-theater support; and 16,610 primarily in the continental United States (CONUS) or otherwise mobilized (see Figure 10 ). The number of personnel actually in-country or in-theater at any given time may exceed or fall below those assumed levels. The FY2019 force level assumes an increase of 3,153 personnel (3.5%) from the FY2018 assumed level, all of which is assumed for in-theater support. (For analysis of troop level and budget trends, see the section, "" Trends in OCO Funding and Troop Levels ,"" earlier in this report.) As previously discussed, DOD acknowledges ""OCO funding has not declined at the same rate as the in-country troop strength … due to the fixed, and often inelastic, costs of infrastructure, support requirements, and in-theater presence to support contingency operations."" The departments lists the following as OCO cost drivers: In-theater support, including infrastructure costs like command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence (C4I) and base operations for U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) locations; Persistent demand for combat support such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets used to enhance force protection; Equipment reset, which lags troop level changes and procurement of contingency-focused assets like munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles and force protection capabilities that may not be linked directly to in-country operations; and International programs and deterrence activities, which are linked to U.S. engagement in contingency operations and support U.S. interests but are not directly proportional to U.S. troop presence. DOD also breaks down the FY2019 OCO budget request by functional category (see Table 3 ). By this measure, the largest portion of OCO funding was $20 billion for in-theater support, followed by operations and force protection (including the incremental cost of military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and other countries), at $14.7 billion; and unspecified classified programs, at $9.9 billion. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), approximately $47 billion (68%) of the FY2019 OCO budget request consists of enduring activities—that is, ""those that would probably continue in the absence of overseas conflicts""—that could be funded in the DOD base budget. CBO associates enduring activities with the following DOD functional categories: in-theater support, classified programs, equipment reset and readiness, European Deterrence Initiative, security cooperation, and joint improvised-threat defeat. Executive Branch budget documents for FY2019 show differing projections for how much OCO would be apportioned over the Future Years Defense Program (also known as the FYDP, pronounced ""fiddip,"" the five-year period from FY2019 through FY2023). For example, Table 1-11 in DOD's National Defense Budget Estimates for FY2019, citing OMB data, projects five-year OCO funding at $359 billion. However, Table 1-9 of the same document puts the figure at $149 billion after assuming a higher amount of OCO funding shifting into the base budget. According to OMB, the President's initial FY2019 budget request projected increasing caps on defense discretionary base budget authority by $84 billion (15%) to $660 billion in FY2020 and by $87 billion (15%) to $677 billion in FY2021. It also projected defense funding for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) totaling $73 billion in FY2020 and $66 billion in FY2021. Thus, projected defense discretionary funding would total $733 billion in FY2020 and $743 billion in FY2021. FY2019 DOD budget documents show the same defense discretionary topline for FY2020 and FY2021. But they list an ""Outyears Placeholder for OCO"" of $20 billion in fiscal years FY2020-FY2023, and an ""OCO to Base"" amount of $53 billion in FY2020 and $45.8 billion in each year from FY2021-FY2023. The documents do not break down what accounts or activities are included in these amounts. The emergence of any new contingencies or conflicts would likely change DOD assumptions about OCO needs. Congress has appropriated a total of $68.8 billion for DOD OCO funding in FY2019, including the following amounts: $67.9 billion in defense funds provided in the Department of Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act, 2019 and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 115-245 ), which Congress passed on September 26, 2018; and $921 million in defense funds provided in the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 115-244 ), which Congress passed on September, 21, 2018. For the Department of State and USAID, as well as the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Coast Guard, FY2019 OCO levels have not yet been determined. They remain at prorated FY2018 levels because of continuing resolutions (CR) to fund certain agencies through December 21, 2018. The FY2019 House and Senate SFOPS bills ( H.R. 6385 and S. 3108 , 115 th Congress) would have appropriated approximately $8 billion in OCO-designated funding for various priorities. The House committee-reported version of the Homeland Security appropriations bill ( H.R. 6776 , 115 th Congress) would not have appropriated any OCO/GWOT funding for the Coast Guard, while the Senate committee-reported version of the bill ( S. 3109 , 115 th Congress) would have appropriated $165 million for OCO/GWOT funding for the Coast Guard. Any decision by the 116 th Congress to change discretionary defense and nondefense spending limits that remain in effect for FY2020 and FY2021 under the Budget Control Act (BCA; P.L. 112-25 ) could impact future OCO funding levels. Lawmakers may consider the following questions: Will Congress keep the BCA as is and rely on OCO funding that is not subject to the caps to meet agency requirements? Will Congress repeal the BCA and use less OCO funding? Will Congress amend the BCA limits for future years and continue to use OCO funding, as it has in the past? Will Congress significantly reduce DOD and international affairs funding to stay within the BCA caps and not use OCO funding? In a November 2018 report, the National Defense Strategy Commission, a bipartisan panel created by Congress, issued recommendations related to OCO and the BCA. Recommendation No. 24 states, ""Congress should eliminate the final two years of caps under the BCA."" Recommendation 29 states, ""To better prepare for major-power competition, Congress should gradually integrate OCO spending back into the base Pentagon budget. This also requires a dollar-for-dollar increase in the BCA spending caps, should they remain in force, so that this transfer does not result in an overall spending cut."" Both House and Senate FY2019 committee-reported appropriations bills from the 115 th Congress included about $8 billion in OCO funding for State/USAID. It remains to be seen if the 116 th Congress will pass this OCO level as requested or extend the continuing resolution. Congress could enact legislation to authorize and appropriate a level of base and OCO spending to meet current or revised discretionary defense spending caps in any number of ways. In FY2019 budget documents from OMB and DOD, the Trump Administration projected increasing defense spending in FY2020 and FY2021 beyond the statutory limits of the Budget Control Act of 2011 ( P.L. 112-25 ), but by differing amounts based on differing OCO projections. These figures serve as possible scenarios or options for Congress to consider. According to OMB budget documents, the President's initial FY2019 budget request projected $733 billion in defense discretionary spending in FY2020, including a base budget of $660 billion (which assumes an $84 billion, or 15%, increase in the BCA defense cap—or repeal of the legislation altogether) and an OCO defense budget of $73 billion (see Figure 11 ). According to DOD budget documents, the President's revised FY2019 budget request projected $733 billion in defense discretionary spending in FY2020, including a base budget of $713 billion (which assumes a $137 billion, or 24%, increase in the BCA defense cap—what would be the largest increase to the BCA defense caps yet—or repeal of the legislation altogether) and an OCO budget of $20 billion. Alternatively, assuming no change in the cap and congressional support for the Administration's projected $733 billion topline in FY2020, Congress could keep the BCA defense cap unchanged at $576 billion and designate an additional $157 billion for OCO. According to OMB budget documents, the President's initial FY2019 budget request projected $743 billion in defense discretionary spending in FY2021, including a base budget of $677 billion (which assumes an $87 billion, or 15%, increase in the BCA defense cap—or repeal of the legislation altogether) and an OCO budget of $66 billion (see Figure 11 ). According to DOD budget documents, the President's revised FY2019 budget request projected $743 billion in defense discretionary spending in FY2021, including a base budget of $723 billion (which assumes a $133 billion, or 23%, increase in the BCA defense cap—or repeal of the legislation altogether) and an OCO budget of $20 billion. Alternatively, assuming no change in the cap and congressional support for the Administration's projected $743 billion topline in FY2020, Congress could keep the BCA defense cap unchanged at $590 billion and designate an additional $153 billion for OCO. As previously discussed, these figures would change with different toplines for the national defense budget function (050). Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the National Defense Strategy Commission have recommended that Congress increase the defense budget between 3% and 5% a year above inflation (""real growth"") to meet U.S. strategic goals. President Donald Trump has said the discretionary defense spending request would total $700 billion in FY2020, a decrease of 2% in nominal terms from FY2019. Trump said, ""We know what the budget—the new budget is for the Defense Department. It will probably be $700 billion."" However, some media outlets have since reported that the President intends to request a discretionary defense budget of $750 billion in FY2020. Senator James Inhofe, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Representative Mac Thornberry, ranking member of the House Armed Services Committees in the 116 th Congress, have argued, ""Any cut in the defense budget would be a senseless step backward."" Thornberry has also said transferring recurring OCO costs into the regular budget ""makes sense … it makes for more predictable budgeting, but it's all about what happens on the topline."" Representative Adam Smith, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee in the 116 th Congress, has said of the defense budget: ""I think the number is too high, and it's certainly not going to be there in the future … We've got a debt, we've got a deficit, we've got infrastructure problems, we've got healthcare, education—there's a whole lot that is necessary to make our country safe, secure, and prosperous."" Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan has talked about a flat topline for national defense: ""When you look at the $700 billion, it's not just for one year drop down, [or] a phase, it's a drop and then held constant"" over the FYDP. Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)/Chief Financial Officer David Norquist, who is also performing the duties of the Deputy Secretary of Defense, at one time was reportedly preparing two budgets for FY2020—one assuming $733 billion for national defense and another assuming $700 billion. An analyst has noted ""returning enduring OCO costs to the base budget, particularly a vast majority of those enduring costs over a short period as DOD has outlined, could significantly complicate an agreement between congressional Democrats and Republicans to increase both the defense and nondefense BCA budget caps for FY2020 and FY2021."" As analyst noted, ""OCO has become an even less-defined pot of money … Congress needs to properly question the DOD budget planners on the future of OCO."" In a January 2017 report, GAO concluded, ""Without a reliable estimate of DOD's enduring OCO costs, decision makers will not have a complete picture of the department's future funding needs or be able to make informed choices and trade-offs in budget formulation and decision making."" The department states it has not fully estimated those costs in part because of the BCA. In a response to GAO, DOD wrote, ""Developing reliable estimates of enduring OCO costs is an important first step to any future effort to transition enduring OCO costs to the base budget. In the context of such an effort, the Department would consider developing and reporting formal estimates of those costs. However, until there is sufficient relief from the budgetary caps established in the Budget Control Act of 2011, the Department will need OCO to finance counterterrorism operations, in particular [OFS] and [OIR]."" In an October 2018 report, the Congressional Budget Office estimated OCO funding for DOD enduring activities—that is, those that would probably continue in the absence of overseas conflicts—totaled more than $50 billion a year (in 2019 dollars) from 2006 to 2018—and are projected to total about $47 billion a year starting in FY2020. This figure appears to be consistent with projections published by DOD. According to the department's FY2019 budget documents, DOD projected $53 billion for ""OCO to Base"" in FY2020 and $45.8 billion for ""OCO to Base"" for FY2021 through FY2023. Some analysts have concluded: Uncertainty created by current reliance on OCO, particularly to fund base budget needs, could be detrimental to national security on three levels: (a) by undermining budget controls and contributing thereby to larger deficits, (b) by generating insecurity in the defense workforce and in defense suppliers, and (c) by creating long-term uncertainty in defense planning. The alternative, transitioning longer-term OCO expenses to the base budget, could be achieved through a combination of increased budget caps, targeted cuts in inefficient Defense programs, and increased revenues. For example, a potential enduring activity in the OCO budget is the European Deterrence Initiative (EDI). It was previously known as the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI), an effort that began in June 2014 to increase the number of U.S. military personnel and prepositioned equipment in Central and Eastern Europe intended in part to reassure NATO allies after Russia's military seized Crimea. As some analysts have noted, ""Because it is in the OCO part of the budget request, EDI funding does not include a projection for how much funding will be allocated in future years, which can create uncertainty in the minds of allies and adversaries alike about the U.S. military's commitment to the program."" On the other hand, some contend that it is precisely EDI's flexibility that allows the commander of European Command to quickly respond to changing security and posture needs in Europe, and ensure that monies intended for European deterrence will not be redirected to other DOD priorities. In its November 2018 report, the National Defense Strategy Commission quoted the late military strategist Bernard Brodie, who wrote ""strategy wears a dollar sign."" The panel concluded that relying on OCO funding to increase the defense budget ""is not the way to provide adequate and stable resources"" for the type of great power competition outlined in the Secretary of Defense's 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS), which calls for the United States to bolster its competitive military advantage relative to threats posed by China and Russia: Because of budgetary constraints imposed by the BCA, lawmakers and the Department of Defense have increasingly relied upon the overseas contingency operations (OCO) fund to pay for warfighting operations in the greater Middle East, as well as other activities and initiatives. Yet this approach to resourcing has produced problems and distortions of its own. For one thing, the amount of money devoted to OCO since the BCA was enacted no longer corresponds to warfighting operations in the greater Middle East. Furthermore, such operations are no longer a top priority as articulated in the NDS. Finally, reorienting the military toward high-end competition and conflict will require new capabilities beyond the current program of record. OCO is not the way to provide adequate and stable resources for such a long-term endeavor, given its lack of predictability and the limitations on what OCO funds can be used to buy."" Appendix A. Statutes, Guidance, and Regulations The designation of funding as emergency requirements or for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism (OCO/GWOT) is governed by several statues as well as Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance and the Department of Defense (DOD) Financial Management Regulation (FMR). The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act (BBEDCA) of 1985 BBEDCA, as amended, includes the statutory definitions of emergency and unanticipated as they relate to budget enforcement through sequestration. The act also allows for appropriations to be designated by Congress and the President as emergency requirements or for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism . Such appropriations are effectively exempt from the statutory discretionary spending limits. Title 10, United States Code—Armed Forces 10 U.S.C. 101—Definitions Section 101 provides definitions of terms applicable to Title 10. While it does not define overseas contingency operations, it does include a definition of a contingency operations . Administration and Internal Guidance In addition to statutory requirements, the DOD and the Department of State are subject to guidance on OCO spending from the Administration. In October 2006 , under the Bush Administration, then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England directed the services to break with long-standing DOD regulatory policies and expand their request for supplemental funding to reflect incremental costs related to the ""longer war on terror."" There was no specific definition for the ""longer war on terror,"" now one of the core missions of the DOD. In February 2009, at the beginning of the Obama Administration, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued updated budget guidance that required DOD to move some OCO costs back into the base budget. However, within six months of issuing the new criteria, officials waived restrictions related to pay and that would have prohibited end-strength growth. In a letter from OMB to the then-Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) Robert Hale, the agency characterized its 2009 criteria as ""very successful"" for delineating base and OCO spending but stated, ""This update clarifies language, eliminates areas of confusion and provides guidance for areas previously unanticipated."" GAO subsequently reported that the revised guidance significantly changed the criteria used to build the fiscal year 2010 OCO funding request by: specifying stricter definitions for repair and procurement of equipment; limiting applicability of OCO funds for RDT&E; excluding pay and allowances for end-strength above the level requested in the budget; excluding enduring family support initiatives; and excluding base realignment and closures (BRAC) amounts. OMB again revised its guidance in September 2010 following a number of GAO reports that had concluded DOD reporting on OCO costs was of ""questionable reliability,"" due in part to imprecisely defined financial management regulations related to OCO spending. (as of September 9, 2010) Source: Letter from Steven M. Kosiak, Associate Director for Defense and Foreign Affairs, OMB, to Robert Hale, Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller, ""Revised War Funding Criteria,"" September 9, 2010. DOD Financial Management Regulations DOD incorporated the September 2010 OMB criteria for war costs into the Financial Management Regulation. Table 1 includes the general cost categories DOD uses in accounting for costs of contingency operations. Appendix B. Transfer Authorities, Special Purpose Accounts In addition to the supplemental appropriations and emergency or OCO/GWOT designation, the Department of Defense and the Department of State also have the authority to shift funds from one budget account to another in response to operational needs. For DOD, these transfers (sometimes called reprogramings ) are statutorily authorized by 10 U.S.C. 2214—Transfer of funds: procedures and limitations. This authority allows the Secretary of Defense to reallocate funds for higher priority items, based on unforeseen military requirements, after receiving written approval from the four congressional defense committees. DOD may also reprogram funds within an account from one activity to another, as long as the general purpose for the use of those funds remains unchanged. Specific limits to transfer or reprogramming authorities have also been added to these general authorities through provisions in annual defense authorization and appropriation acts. The FY2019 defense appropriations bill sets the base budget transfer cap at $4 billion and the OCO transfer cap at $2 billion. The Department of State's OCO transfer authority has been provided in appropriations acts and has specifically authorized the Administration to transfer OCO funds only to other OCO funds within Title VIII SFOPS appropriations, not between OCO and base accounts. The transfer authority is capped, specified by account, and requires regular congressional notification procedures. Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund (OCOTF) The OCOTF was established for DOD in FY1997 as a no year transfer account (meaning amounts are available until expended) in order to provide additional flexibility to meet operational requirements. Transfers from the OCOTF are processed using existing reprogramming procedures. A quarterly report is submitted to the congressional oversight committees, documenting all transfers from the OCOTF to DOD components base budget accounts. Beginning in FY2002, funds to support Southwest Asia, Kosovo, and Bosnia contingency requirements were appropriated directly to DOD components' Operation and Maintenance (O&M) and Military Personnel accounts rather than to the OCOTF for later disbursement. FY2014 was the last year the Administration requested a direct appropriation to the OCOTF. Contingency Operations Funded in the DOD Base Budget As first mandated by section 8091 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2008 ( P.L. 110-116 ), Congress has required DOD to provide separate annual budget justification documents detailing the costs of U.S. armed forces' participation in all named contingency operations where the total cost of the operation exceeds $100 million or is staffed by more than 1,000 U.S. military personnel. Funding for certain DOD contingency operations has been moved to the base budget request, and is no longer designated as emergency or OCO/GWOT requirements. This movement of funding from the OCO request to the base budget request typically occurs as the operational activities of an enduring contingency operation evolve over time and DOD determines that certain elements of the associated military operations have become stable enough to be planned, financed, and executed within the base budget. For example, funding for Operation Noble Eagle, which provides fighter aircraft on 24/7 alert at several U.S. military bases, was moved from the GWOT request to the base budget request in 2005. Contingency operations and other activities funded wholly or in part through DOD's base budget have included: NATO Operations in the Balkans . The U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force provide support to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization-led operations in the Balkans region. Most U.S. forces are deployed to Kosovo in support of the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR). A small number of U.S. personnel are deployed to the NATO headquarters in Sarajevo in Bosnia and Herzegovina; Joint Task Force - Bravo . U.S. forces support this task force, which operates from Soto Cano Air Base in Honduras and supports joint, combined, and interagency exercises and operations in Central America to counter the influence of transnational organized crime; carry out humanitarian assistance and disaster relief; and build military capacity with regional partners and allied nations to promote regional cooperation and security; Operation Juniper Shield. Previously known as Operation Enduring Freedom-Trans Sahara (OEF-TS), this operation supports efforts to defeat violent extremist organizations in East Africa. This operation also provides military-to-military engagement with partner African countries, as well as readiness for crisis response and evacuation of U.S. military, diplomatic, and civilian personnel; Operation Noble Eagle . This operation funds the continuing efforts to defend the United States from airborne attacks, maintain the sovereignty of the United States airspace, and defend critical U.S. facilities from potentially hostile threats or unconventional attacks; Operation Enduring Freedom- Horn of Africa . This operation was established to support efforts to defeat violent extremist organizations in East Africa; provide military-to-military engagement with partner African countries, as well as readiness for crisis response and evacuation of U.S. military, diplomatic, and civilian personnel throughout East Africa; Operation Enduring Freedom- Caribbean and Central America . A U.S. regional military operation initiated in 2008, under the operational control of Special Operations Command-South, this operation was established to focus on counterterrorism to support DOD's overall military objectives and the larger fight against terrorism. Operation Observant Compass . This operation was established to support the deployment of approximately 100 U.S. military personnel assisting the Ugandan People's Defense Force and neighboring partner African countries in countering the Lord's Resistance Army operations. Operation Spartan Shield. This operation was established to support ongoing U.S. Central Command missions. Other Congressionally Authorized Funds or Programs Through the OCO authorization and appropriation process, Congress has created numerous funds and programs that are designed to finance specific overseas contingency operations-related activities that do not fit into traditional budgetary accounts. Many of these funds and programs are supplied with amounts that are available until expended—however, authorization for the specified fund or program has an expiration date, thereby requiring further congressional action for reauthorization of affected funds or programs. Congress has also provided increased transfer authority to provide greater flexibility for U.S. government activities in situations that are typically unpredictable. Examples of these types of congressionally authorized OCO programs or funds have included: Afghan istan Security Forces Fund (ASFF) and Counter-ISIS Train and Equip Fund (CTEF) . These funds were established to provide funding and support for the training, equipping, and expansion of selected military and security forces in support of U.S. objectives; Counterterrorism Partnership s Fund . This fund was established to provide funding and support to partner nations engaged in counterterrorism and crisis response activities; Command er's Emergency Response Program. This program was established to support infrastructure improvements, such as road repair and construction and enable military commanders on the ground to respond to urgent humanitarian relief and reconstruction needs by undertaking activities that will immediately aid local populations and assist U.S. forces in maintaining security gains; Joint Improvised Explosive Device (IEDs) Defeat Fund . This fund was established to coordinate and focus all counter-IED efforts, including ongoing research and development, throughout DOD. Due to the enduring nature of the threat, DOD began moving associated funding to the base budget in FY2010; Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle (MRAP) Fund . This fund was intended to expedite the procurement and deployment of MRAPs to Iraq and Afghanistan; European Deterrence Initiative (EDI) . Initially the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI), this effort was established to provide funding and support to NATO allies and partners to ""reassure allies of the U.S. commitment to their security and territorial integrity as members of the NATO Alliance, provide near-term flexibility and responsiveness to the evolving concerns of our allies and partners in Europe, especially Central and Eastern Europe, and help increase the capability and readiness of U.S. allies and partners;"" Global Security Contingency Fund . This fund was established to provide funding for the Department of State and the Department of Defense ""to facilitate an interagency approach to confronting security challenges;"" Complex Crise s Fund . This fund was established to provide funding through the State Department and USAID ""to help prevent crises and promote recovery in post-conflict situations during unforeseen political, social, or economic challenges that threaten regional security;"" Migration and Refugee Assistance Fund . This fund was established to provide funding to respond to refugee crises in Africa, the Near East, South and Central Asia, and Europe and Eurasia; and Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative . This initiative was established to provide assistance, including training, equipment, lethal weapons, of a defensive nature; logistics support; supplies and services; sustainment; and intelligence support to the military and national security forces of Ukraine.

Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress has appropriated approximately $2 trillion in discretionary budget authority designated as emergency requirements or for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism (OCO/GWOT) in support of the broad U.S. government response to the 9/11 attacks and for other related international affairs activities. This figure amounts to approximately 9.4% of total discretionary spending during this period. Congress has used supplemental appropriation acts or designated funding for emergency requirements or OCO/GWOT—or both—in statute. These funds are not subject to limits on discretionary spending in congressional budget resolutions or to the statutory discretionary spending limits established by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-125). The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA; P.L. 99-177) allows emergency funding to be excluded from budget control limits. The BCA added the OCO/GWOT designation to the BBEDCA exemption, thereby providing Congress and the President with an alternate way to exclude funding from the BCA spending limits. While there is no overall statutory limit on the amount of emergency or OCO/GWOT spending, both Congress and the President have fundamental roles in determining how much of the spending to provide each fiscal year. Congress must designate any such funding in statute on an account-by-account basis. The President is also required to designate it as such after it is appropriated to be available for expenditure. Debate over what should constitute OCO/GWOT or emergency activities and expenses has shifted over time, reflecting differing viewpoints about the extent, nature, and duration of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere. Funding designated for OCO/GWOT has also been used to fund base-budget requirements of the DOD and State Department and to prevent or respond to crises abroad, including armed conflict, as well as human-caused and natural disasters. Some defense officials and policymakers argue OCO funding allows for flexible response to contingencies, and provides a ""safety valve"" to the spending caps and threat of sequestration—the automatic cancellation of budget authority largely through across-the-board reductions of nonexempt programs and activities—under the BCA. Critics, however, have described OCO/GWOT as a loophole or ""gimmick""—morphing from an account for replacing combat losses of equipment, resupplying expended munitions, and transporting troops through war zones, to a ""slush fund"" for activities unrelated to contingency operations. Congress appropriated approximately $103 billion for OCO in FY2017 (8.5% of all discretionary appropriations), $78 billion for OCO in FY2018 (5.5% of all discretionary appropriations), and $68.8 billion for OCO so far in FY2019. Discretionary appropriations for FY2019 are not yet final; a continuing resolution expired December 21, 2018. Following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123), which raised discretionary budget caps for defense and foreign affairs agencies in FY2018 and FY2019, the Administration proposed shifting some OCO funding into the base, or regular, budget. Although Congress has generally not followed Administration requests for reduced funding for foreign affairs and domestic activities and has increased funding for defense, the President has asked cabinet secretaries to propose spending cuts of 5% in FY2020. Such proposals, if requested in a budget submission, may create difficult choices for Congress in FY2020 and FY2021—the final two years of the BCA discretionary spending limits. Congress\'s decisions on OCO/GWOT designations will affect how much agency funding is available for military operations and foreign affairs activities overseas, how much is subject to the BCA caps, and how much is incorporated into regular budgets and long-term budget projections.']","9854","gov_report","en","None","8be9961b3148717dd324148abf0ab947fb11adb0b9ca3fc6","Summary:","gov_report","532","\nThis report provides aims topline, Analysis, and Budgetary Issues.

Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nThe DRC is a vast, mineral-rich nation with an estimated population of about 83 million people and an area that is roughly one-quarter the size of the United States, according to the United Nations. Figure 1 shows the DRC’s provinces and adjoining countries. Since gaining its independence from Belgium in 1960, the DRC has undergone political upheaval and armed conflict. From 1998 to 2003, the DRC and eight other African countries were involved in what has become known as “Africa’s World War,” which resulted in a death toll of an estimated 5 million people in the DRC, according to the U.S. Department of State (State). The eastern DRC has continued to be plagued by violence, often perpetrated against civilians by illegal armed groups and some members of the Congolese national military. Notably, in 2012, an illegal armed group occupied the city of Goma and other cities in the eastern DRC and clashed with the Congolese national army. During this time, the United Nations reported numerous cases of sexual violence against civilians, including women and children, which were perpetrated by armed groups and some members of the Congolese national military. In 2017, the United Nations reported that serious violations of human rights remain widespread in the DRC, including continued acts of sexual violence by government security forces as well as nonstate armed groups. Various industries, particularly manufacturing industries, use the four conflict minerals specifically named in the Dodd-Frank Act—tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold—in a wide variety of products. For example, tin is used to solder metal pieces and is also found in food packaging, steel coatings on automobile parts, and some plastics. Tungsten is used in automobile manufacturing, drill bits and cutting tools, and other industrial manufacturing tools and is the primary component of filaments in incandescent light bulbs. Most tantalum is used to manufacture capacitors that enable energy storage in electronic products such as cell phones and computers or to produce alloy additives used in turbines in jet engines. Gold is held as bullion by central bank reserves and used in making jewelry and also in the electronics industry, for example, to manufacture cell phones and laptops. In August 2012, SEC adopted its conflict minerals disclosure rule in response to Section 1502(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act. The act required that SEC promulgate disclosure and reporting regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals originating from the DRC and covered countries. In the summary section of the adopting release for the rule, SEC noted that to accomplish the goal of helping to end the human rights abuses in the DRC caused by the conflict, Congress chose to use the Dodd-Frank Act’s disclosure requirements to bring greater public awareness of the sources of companies’ conflict minerals and to promote the exercise of due diligence on conflict mineral supply chains. The SEC disclosure rule addresses the four conflict minerals named in the Dodd-Frank Act from the DRC and covered countries. The rule outlines a process for companies to follow, as applicable, to comply with the rule (see app. II). The process broadly requires a company to 1. determine whether it manufactures, or contracts to be manufactured, products with “necessary” conflict minerals; 2. conduct a reasonable country-of-origin inquiry (RCOI) concerning the origin of those conflict minerals; and 3. exercise due diligence, if appropriate, to determine the source and chain of custody of those conflict minerals, adhering to a nationally or internationally recognized due diligence framework, if such a framework is available for these necessary conflict minerals. If companies choose to disclose that their products are “DRC conflict free,” the SEC disclosure rule requires companies to obtain an independent private-sector audit (IPSA). Our review of companies’ conflict minerals disclosures filed with the SEC in 2017 found that, in general, they were similar to disclosures filed in the prior 2 years. In 2017, a similar number of companies filed conflict minerals disclosures as in 2015 and 2016. Based on our review of a generalizable sample, we found that almost all companies that filed conflict minerals disclosures in 2017 reported performing inquiries about their conflict minerals’ country of origin, similar to the results we previously reported for 2016 and 2015. In their 2017 disclosure reports, many companies described actions they took to improve data collection processes, and most companies indicated challenges in determining the country of origin. Our review of company filings found that almost all companies required to conduct due diligence, as a result of their country- of-origin inquires, reported performing it. SEC issued revised guidance in April 2017, indicating that the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance would not recommend enforcement action if companies did not report on specified due diligence disclosure requirements. In 2017, 1,165 companies filed conflict minerals disclosures—almost as many companies as filed in 2016 and 2015 (1,230 and 1,281 respectively). Our analysis of a generalizable sample of filings found that an estimated 90 percent of the companies that filed in 2017 were domestic and an estimated 10 percent were foreign companies, similar to the domestic-to-foreign ratio we found in 2016 and 2015. While not all companies reported the minerals used, of those that disclosed this information, an estimated 69 percent reported using tin, 54 percent reported using tantalum, 59 percent reported using tungsten, and 63 percent reported using gold, figures that are similar to the percentages reported in 2016. Our analysis of a generalizable sample of 2017 filings found that, as in 2016 and 2015, almost all companies that filed conflict minerals disclosures indicated that they performed country-of-origin inquiries. Specifically, an estimated 100 percent of the companies reported that they performed such an inquiry, similar to the percentages that we estimated reported doing so in 2016 and 2015. As a result of the inquiries they conducted, an estimated 53 percent of companies reported in 2017 whether the conflict minerals in their products came from covered countries—similar to the estimate of 49 percent in 2016 and in 2015 but significantly higher than the estimate of 30 percent in 2014 (see fig. 2). In the filings we reviewed, many companies indicated they had taken actions to improve their data collection processes, such as gathering missing information about their supply chains and working with suppliers to encourage conflict-free sourcing. In interviews, representatives of selected companies that filed conflict minerals disclosures in 2017 and other industry participants noted that (1) awareness among suppliers about the use of conflict minerals had continued to increase and (2) the process for collecting data on supply chains had become more routine and standardized. However, as in prior years, our review of filings found that most companies reported challenges in determining the country of origin of conflict minerals, in part due to lack of access to suppliers and complex supply chains involving many suppliers and processing facilities. Our review of company filings found that almost all companies that were required, as a result of their country-of-origin inquires, to conduct due diligence on the source and chain of custody of the conflict minerals in their products reported doing so. In 2017, an estimated 96 percent reported conducting due diligence, compared with 96 and 97 percent in 2016 and 2015 respectively. An estimated 87 percent of companies in 2017 reported using a due diligence framework prescribed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidance for conducting due diligence on the source and chain of custody of the conflict minerals in their products. That result is comparable to an estimated 92 percent that we reported in 2016 and an estimated 95 percent that we reported in 2015. The remaining 13 percent of the companies that reported conducting due diligence in 2017 did not specify a framework for their due diligence activities. After conducting due diligence, an estimated 37 percent of the companies reported in 2017 that they were able to determine that their conflict minerals came from covered countries or from scrap or recycled sources, compared with an estimated 39 and 23 percent in 2016 and 2015, respectively. An estimated 47 percent of the companies in 2017 reported that they could not definitively confirm the source of the conflict minerals in their products, compared with an estimated 55 and 67 percent in 2016 and 2015, respectively. However, as in previous years, almost all of the companies that reported conducting due diligence in 2017 reported that they could not determine whether the conflict minerals financed or benefited armed groups. Four companies in our sample reported determining that the minerals in their products did not finance or benefit armed groups in covered countries, and declared some products “DRC- conflict free.” Three of these companies included the required independent private-sector audit (IPSA) report, and one company did not include an IPSA report. Overall, a total of 16 companies filed an IPSA report in 2017, compared with 19 in 2016. In April 2017, the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance issued revised guidance indicating that it would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission if companies did not report on specified due diligence disclosure requirements. The SEC disclosure rule requires companies, if applicable, to report on their due diligence in a conflict minerals report (see app. II for additional detail on the disclosure requirements). SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance staff told us that they received inquiries from a small number of companies about the filing process for 2017. In response to these inquiries, these staff noted that they advised companies that the companies had the flexibility to determine whether or not to report on their due diligence and to report their country-of-origin inquiry findings in either the Form SD or in a conflict minerals report. However, the Division of Corporation Finance staff also told us that, regardless of the division’s revised guidance, the SEC could still initiate enforcement action if companies do not report on their due diligence, as required by the SEC disclosure rule. In our sample, three companies cited the updated guidance and other statements issued by the SEC in their filings as a rationale for not reporting on due diligence activities. In interviews, representatives of some companies and other industry participants told us that even though the revised guidance and other statements made by the SEC raised some uncertainty about the filing process, generally, companies plan to continue to report similar conflict minerals disclosure information. We identified two new population-based surveys since our last report related to sexual violence in Burundi and Uganda published in 2018; the most recent information for eastern DRC and Rwanda is from 2016. We also identified some new case-file data on sexual violence in the DRC; however, as we reported previously, case-file data on sexual violence are not suitable for estimating an overall rate of sexual violence. We identified two new population-based surveys related to sexual violence that were conducted in Uganda and Burundi in 2016 and 2017, respectively, and whose results were published in 2018. The Uganda Demographic and Health Survey was conducted from June to December 2016 by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics with technical assistance from ICF International. The survey estimated that 12.7 percent of women nationwide, ages 15-49, reported they had experienced sexual violence in the 12-month period preceding the survey, while 21.9 percent reported they had experienced sexual violence at some point in their lifetime. In addition, 4 percent of men nationwide, ages 15-49, reported they had experienced sexual violence in the 12-month period preceding the survey, while 8.3 percent reported they had experienced sexual violence at some point in their lifetime. The Burundi Demographic and Health Survey was conducted from October of 2016 to March of 2017 by the Burundi Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies with technical assistance from ICF International. The survey estimated that 12.7 percent of women nationwide, ages 15- 49, reported they had experienced sexual violence in the 12-month period preceding the survey, while 23.1 percent reported they had experienced sexual violence at some point in their lifetime. In addition, 1.9 percent of men nationwide, ages 15-49, reported they had experienced sexual violence in the 12-month period preceding the survey, while 6.1 percent reported they had experienced sexual violence at some point in their lifetime. The most recent information on the rate of sexual violence for eastern DRC and Rwanda is from 2016 and is discussed in our previous reports. Figure 3 shows the publication dates for the population-based surveys with data on rates of sexual violence in the eastern DRC, Rwanda, Uganda, and Burundi that have been published since 2007. State and United Nations entities have provided additional case-file information about instances of sexual violence in the DRC and adjoining countries. State’s annual country reports on human rights practices provided the following case-file data pertaining to sexual violence in the DRC and Burundi: DRC. In 2017, the UN documented 267 adult victims and 171 child victims, including two boys, of sexual violence in conflict. This violence was perpetrated by illegal armed groups as well as state security forces and civilians and was concentrated in North Kivu Province and in the Kasai region, according to State. Burundi. One government organization—Humara Center— responsible for investigating cases of sexual violence and rape received 197 cases of sexual and gender-based violence through early December 2017, according to State. Observers stated many women were reluctant to report rape, in part due to fear of reprisal, according to State. In addition, UN entities reported the following case-file data about sexual violence in the DRC: DRC. In 2017, the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the DRC verified 195 cases of conflict-related sexual violence, with illegal armed groups responsible for 80 percent of the cases and DRC security forces responsible for the remaining 20 percent. United Nations officials we interviewed raised concerns about a resurgence of sexual violence in certain regions in the DRC due to a variety of factors, including political instability arising from the government’s postponement of the presidential election originally scheduled to take place in November 2016. We provided a draft of this report to the SEC, State, and the U.S. Agency for International Development for comment. SEC provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. State and USAID did not provide comments. We are sending copies of this report to appropriate congressional committees and to the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Secretary of State, and the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development. The report is also available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-8612 or gianopoulosk@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix III. In this report, we provide information about (1) companies’ disclosures filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2017 compared with disclosures filed in the prior 2 years and (2) the rate of sexual violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighboring countries published in 2017 and early 2018. To examine the fourth annual company disclosures filed with the SEC in 2017 in response to the SEC disclosure rule, we downloaded the specialized disclosure reports (Form SD) and conflict minerals reports (CMR) from SEC’s publically available Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) database in September 2017. We downloaded 1,165 filings identified as Form SDs and the CMRs included in EDGAR. To review the completeness and accuracy of the EDGAR database, we reviewed relevant documentation, interviewed knowledgeable SEC officials, and reviewed prior GAO reports on internal controls related to SEC’s financial systems. We determined that the EDGAR database was sufficiently reliable for identifying the universe of SD filings. We reviewed the conflict minerals section of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) and the requirements of the SEC disclosure rule to develop a data collection instrument (DCI) that guided our analysis of Form SDs and CMRs that contain the information disclosed by the filing companies. Our DCI was not a compliance review of the Form SDs and CMRs. The questions were written in both yes-no and multiple-choice formats. An analyst reviewed the Form SDs and CMRs and recorded responses to the DCI for all of the companies in the sample. A second analyst also reviewed the Form SDs and CMRs and verified the responses recorded by the first analyst. Analysts met to discuss and resolve any discrepancies. We randomly sampled 100 Form SDs from a population of 1,165 to create estimates generalizable to the population of all companies that filed. All estimates based on our sample have a margin of error of plus or minus 10 percentage points or less at the 95-percent confidence level. Because we followed a probability procedure based on random selections, our sample is only one of a large number of samples that we might have drawn. Since each sample could have provided different estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our particular sample’s results as a 95-percent confidence interval. This is the interval that would contain the actual population value for 95 percent of the samples we could have drawn. We also attended an industry conference on conflict minerals and spoke with company representatives to provide additional perspective. To address our second objective, we identified and assessed any information on sexual violence in the eastern DRC and the three adjoining countries—Rwanda, Uganda, and Burundi—that had been published or otherwise had become available in 2017 and early 2018. We discussed the collection of sexual violence–related data in the DRC and adjoining countries, including population-based survey data and case-file data, during interviews with U.S. Department of State and U.S. Agency for International Development officials and with representatives of nongovernmental organizations and researchers whom we interviewed for our prior review of sexual violence rates in the eastern DRC and adjoining countries. We also interviewed officials from the United Nations Population Fund and the United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General in New York on Sexual Violence in Conflict. In addition, we conducted Internet searches to identify new academic articles containing any additional information on sexual violence published in 2017 and early 2018. We conducted this performance audit from September 2017 to June 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) conflict minerals disclosure rule requires certain companies to file a specialized disclosure report, known as the Form SD, if the company manufactures, or contracts to have manufactured, a product or products containing conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or the production of those products. The rule also requires each company, as applicable, to provide a description of the measures the company took to exercise due diligence in determining the source and chain of custody of the conflict minerals, the facilities used to process them, their country of origin, and the efforts made to determine the mine or location of origin with the greatest possible specificity. Form SD provides general instructions for filing conflict minerals disclosures and specifies the information that companies must provide. Companies were required to file under the rule for the first time by June 2, 2014, and annually thereafter on May 31. Figure 4 shows the SEC’s flowchart summarizing the conflict minerals disclosure rule.

GAO-10-1030. Washington, D.C.: September 30, 2010.\n\n","[""Over the past decade, the United States and the international community have sought to improve security in the DRC. In the eastern DRC, armed groups have committed severe human rights abuses, including sexual violence, and reportedly profit from the exploitation of “conflict minerals”— in particular, tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold, according to the United Nations. Congress included a provision in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that, among other things, required the SEC to promulgate regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals from the DRC and adjoining countries. The SEC adopted these regulations in 2012. The act also included a provision for GAO to annually assess the SEC regulations' effectiveness in promoting peace and security and report on the rate of sexual violence in the DRC and adjoining countries. In this report, GAO provides information about (1) companies' conflict minerals disclosures filed with the SEC in 2017 compared with disclosures filed in the prior 2 years and (2) the rate of sexual violence in the eastern DRC and adjoining countries published in 2017 and early 2018. GAO analyzed a generalizable random sample of SEC filings and interviewed relevant officials. GAO reviewed U.S., United Nations, and international organizations' reports; interviewed DRC officials, and other stakeholders; and conducted fieldwork in New York at the United Nations headquarters. GAO is not making any recommendations. GAO's review of companies' conflict minerals disclosures filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2017 found that, in general, they were similar to disclosures filed in the prior 2 years. In 2017, 1,165 companies filed conflict minerals disclosures—about the same as in 2016 and 2015. Percentages of companies reporting country-of-origin inquiries in 2017 were also similar to the percentages from those 2 prior years. As a result of the inquiries they conducted, an estimated 53 percent of companies reported in 2017 whether the conflict minerals in their products came from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries—similar to the estimated 49 percent in 2016 and 2015 but significantly higher than the estimate of 30 percent in 2014 (see figure). In their 2017 disclosure reports, many companies described actions they took to improve data collection processes, and most companies indicated some challenges in determining the country of origin. Similar to the prior 2 years, almost all companies required to conduct due diligence, as a result of their country-of-origin inquiries, reported doing so. After conducting due diligence to determine the source and chain of custody of any conflict minerals used, an estimated 37 percent of these companies reported in 2017 that they were able to determine that their conflict minerals came from covered countries or from scrap or recycled sources, compared with 39 and 23 percent in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Four companies in GAO's sample declared their products “DRC conflict-free,” and of those, three included the required Independent Private Sector Audit report (IPSA), and one did not. In 2017, 16 companies filed an IPSA; 19 did so in 2016. GAO found information on the rate of sexual violence in the 2017 Uganda and Burundi Demographic and Health Surveys. For Uganda, 22 percent of women and 9 percent of men reported they had experienced sexual violence at least once in their lifetime. For Burundi, 23 percent of women and 6 percent of men reported they had experienced sexual violence at least once in their lifetime. The most recent information on the rate of sexual violence for eastern DRC and Rwanda is from 2016 and is discussed in our previous GAO reports.""]","3558","gov_report","en","None","0867ce8275f7a6d527058c76ff165eb872f89416e4acdf0c","Summary:","gov_report","532","\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is a vast, mineral-rich nation with an estimated population of 83 million people. Since gaining its independence from Belgium in 1960, the DRC has experienced political upheaval and armed conflict. The DRC was involved in the ""Africa's World War"" from 1998 to 2003, which resulted in an estimated 5 million deaths. The eastern DRC continues to this day is plagued by violence, often perpetrated by illegal armed groups and some members of the Congolese national military. In 2012, an illegal armed group occupied the city of Goma and other cities in the eastern DRC, clashing with the Congolese national army. The United Nations reported numerous cases of sexual violence against civilians, including women and children, committed by both armed groups and some members of the Congolese national military. In 2017, the United Nations reported that serious human rights violations remain widespread in the DRC, including continued acts of sexual violence by government security forces and non-state armed groups.\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted a conflict minerals disclosure rule in response to the Dodd-Frank Act in 2012. The rule requires companies to disclose the source and chain of custody of conflict minerals in their products. In 2017, 1,165 companies filed conflict minerals disclosures with the SEC, and 967% of them reported conducting due diligence on the source and chain of their conflict minerals. 87% of companies reported using a due diligence framework prescribed by the Organization for Economic Co-Cooperation and Development (OECD).\n\nThe report also includes information on the rate of sexual violence in the eastern DRC and neighboring countries, including Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda. The United Nations and State Department officials provided information on the collection of sexual violence-related data in the DRC and adjoining countries, including population-based survey data and case-file data. The report also includes information on the resurgence of sexual violence in the DRC due to political instability."
"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nSeveral U.S. agencies have roles and responsibilities related to the screening and vetting of NIV applicants, as shown in table 1. Key Visa Adjudication Process Terms Validity period: The length of time during which a nonimmigrant visa (NIV) is valid for use by a foreign national seeking to travel to a U.S. port of entry and apply for admission into the United States. Entries: The number of applications for admission into the country permitted under a single NIV. Reciprocity arrangements: An understanding or arrangement between the U.S. government and another country on the length of time visas issued by either or both nations are valid for admission. There are many NIVs, and for the purposes of this report, we have placed the majority of NIVs into one of seven groups, as shown in table 2. The validity period and number of entries varies depending on (1) the particular NIV and (2) reciprocity arrangement with an individual’s country of nationality, among other factors. For example, a foreign national of one country may be issued a tourist visa valid for 1 year that allows for a single U.S. entry, while a foreign national of another country may be issued a tourist visa valid for 5 years and that permits multiple entries. However, the authorized period of stay—that is, the amount of time that the nonimmigrant is permitted to remain in the United States after being admitted—has no relation to the validity period. For more information on the various NIVs, see appendix I. State is generally responsible for the adjudication of NIV applications, and manages the NIV application process, including the consular officer corps and its functions at more than 220 visa-issuing posts overseas. Depending on various factors, such as the particular NIV sought, the applicant’s background, and visa demand, State officials noted that the length of the visa adjudication process can vary from a single day to months. This screening and vetting process for determining who will be issued or refused a visa contains several steps, as shown in figure 1: Petitions. Prior to State’s adjudication process, some NIVs require applicants to first obtain an approved petition from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), as shown in table 3. For example, applicants seeking an employment-based NIV or a U.S. citizen’s foreign national fiancé(e) seeking U.S. entry to conclude a valid marriage, must obtain an approved petition from USCIS prior to applying for their NIV. The petitioner (i.e., a U.S. citizen, organization or business entity) completes the petition on behalf of the applicant (i.e., the beneficiary), and the petition would be submitted to a U.S.-based USCIS service center for adjudication. USCIS Background Checks. As part of the adjudication process for visas requiring a USCIS-approved petition before the NIV application is submitted to State, USCIS conducts background checks on U.S.- based petitioners and foreign beneficiaries. For example, petitioner and beneficiary information is screened against TECS—DHS’s principal law enforcement and antiterrorism database that includes enforcement, inspection, and operational records. Further, for U.S. citizens petitioning for a K-1 visa on behalf of their fiancé(e), an FBI fingerprint check may also be required of the U.S. citizen petitioner. If the background checks identify a potential match to derogatory information, the background check unit at the USCIS service center that received the petition is to conduct further research to confirm the match, such as running checks against other government systems and collaborating with other government agencies. If all background check hits have been resolved and documented, and there is no reason not to proceed, USCIS will adjudicate the petition. In fiscal year 2017, USCIS reported that it received about 640,000 petitions for NIVs, and approved over 550,000. NIV Application. After having obtained USCIS approval of the NIV petition, as applicable, the foreign national begins the consular process by completing an online NIV application, known as a DS-160. Upon submitting an application, the applicant can schedule an interview at a post overseas and pays the processing fee. Key Visa Adjudication Process Terms Inadmissible: Individuals are inadmissible to the United States if they fall within the classes of foreign nationals defined as such under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), as amended, Pub. L. No. 82-414, tit. II, ch. 2, § 212(a), 66 Stat. 163, 182-87 (1952) (classified, as amended, at 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)), such as foreign nationals who have engaged in terrorist or criminal activities or previously violated U.S. immigration law. If a visa applicant is found inadmissible, and has not obtained a waiver from the Department of Homeland Security, the applicant would be statutorily ineligible for a visa. Ineligible: An individual is ineligible for a visa if it appears to the Department of State consular officer, based on the application or supporting documentation, that the applicant is not qualified to receive a visa under any provision of law. If the consular officer decides that an applicant is ineligible for visa issuance, the refusal may be based on statutory grounds of inadmissibility under INA § 212(a), or may be due to the individual’s failure to otherwise satisfy the applicable eligibility requirements for the particular visa, as defined in the INA. For example, a consular officer may refuse a J-1 exchange visitor visa to an applicant coming to the United States to perform services as a member of the medical profession if the applicant does not either demonstrate competency in oral and written English or hold a degree from an accredited school of medicine, as required of such visa applicants under INA § 212(j). eligibility concerns related to visa applicants. Prior to adjudicating the visa application, consular officers must review all such security check results. Some applicants are not subjected to all of the security checks depending on certain characteristics, such as age and visa category. For example, State does not generally require that fingerprints be collected for applicants who are either under 14 years old or over 79 years old, or for foreign government officials seeking certain visas. As needed, some applicants undergo an interagency review process called a security advisory opinion (SAO), which is a multi-agency, U.S-based review process for certain NIV applicants. For example, SAOs are mandatory in cases of certain security check hits, a foreign national’s background, or a foreign national’s intention while in the United States. In addition, consular officers have the discretion to request an SAO for any visa applicant. Through the SAO process, consular officers send additional information on applicants to U.S.- based agencies, who review that information against their holdings. Department of State data indicate that consular officers made over 180,000 requests for SAOs for NIV applicants in fiscal year 2017. Adjudication. If the consular officer determines that the applicant is eligible for the visa on the basis of the application, supporting documentation, and other relevant information such as statements made in an interview, he or she will take the applicant’s passport for final processing, but the visa cannot be printed until all security checks have been returned and reviewed. If the consular officer determines that the applicant is inadmissible to the United States or otherwise ineligible under the applicable visa eligibility criteria, he or she informs the applicant that the visa has been refused, and identifies the provision(s) of law under which the visa was refused. Recurrent vetting. In March 2010, shortly after the December 2009 attempted bombing by a foreign national traveling to the United States on a valid visa, CBP began vetting individuals with NIVs on a recurrent basis. This program has led State to revoke visas after they have been issued when information was later discovered that rendered the individual inadmissible to the United States or otherwise ineligible for the visa. In addition, CBP analysts may take other actions as needed after identifying new derogatory information, such as recommending that the airline deny boarding to the traveler because the traveler is likely to be deemed inadmissible upon arrival in the United States (known as a no-board recommendation) or making a referral to ICE, which may seek to remove the individual if already within the United States. According to NCTC, KFE also conducts recurrent vetting of NIV holders against emerging threat information. The total number of NIV applications that consular officers adjudicated annually (or, NIV adjudications) peaked at about 13.4 million in fiscal year 2016, which was an increase of approximately 30 percent since fiscal year 2012. In fiscal year 2017, NIV adjudications decreased by about 880,000 adjudications, or about 7 percent. Figure 2 shows the number of applications adjudicated each year from fiscal year 2012 through 2017. Appendix II includes additional data on NIV adjudications related to this and the other figures in this report. Annual Monthly Trends. State data from fiscal years 2012 through 2016 indicate that NIV adjudications generally followed an annual cycle, ebbing during certain months during the fiscal year; however, adjudications in fiscal year 2017 departed slightly from this trend. Specifically, from fiscal years 2012 through 2016, the number of NIV adjudications typically peaked in the summer months. State officials noted that the summer peak is generally due to international students who are applying for their visas for the coming academic year. However, in fiscal year 2017, the summer months did not experience a similar increase from previous months, departing from the trend over the previous five fiscal years, according to State data. Instead, NIV adjudications peaked in December of fiscal year 2017. State officials attributed some of the decline in fiscal year 2017 to a decrease in Chinese NIV applicants, which we discuss later in this report. Figure 3 shows monthly NIV adjudications for fiscal years 2012 through 2017. State data on NIV applications adjudicated from fiscal years 2012 through 2017 indicate that the number of adjudications by visa group, applicant’s country of nationality, and location of adjudication were generally consistent, with some exceptions. Visa Group. From fiscal years 2012 through 2017, about 80 percent of NIV adjudications were for tourist and business visitors as shown in figure 4. The next largest groups were visas for students and exchange visitors and temporary workers, which accounted for an average of 9 percent and 6 percent, respectively, of all adjudications during this time period. Although adjudications for visas in some categories increased, others decreased over time. For example, as shown in figure 5, NIV adjudications for temporary workers increased by approximately 50 percent from fiscal years 2012 through 2017 (592,000 to 885,000). During the same time period, adjudications for tourist and business visitors also increased by approximately 20 percent overall (from 8.18 million to 9.97 million), but decreased from fiscal years 2016 to 2017. However, NIV adjudications for student and exchange visitor visas decreased by about 2 percent from fiscal years 2012 through 2017 (1.01 million to 993,000) overall, but experienced a peak in fiscal year 2015 of 1.2 million. Appendix I includes additional information on NIV adjudication by visa group from fiscal years 2012 through 2017. State officials identified reasons to explain these trends: Temporary Workers. Although there was an increase in adjudications across all types of temporary worker visas, the largest percentage increase was for H-2A visas, which are for foreign workers seeking to perform agricultural services of a temporary or seasonal nature. Specifically, adjudications of H-2A visas increased by 140 percent from fiscal years 2012 to 2017 (from about 71,000 to 170,000). State officials noted that H-2A visas are not numerically limited by statute. Further, State officials stated that they believe U.S. employers are increasingly less likely to hire workers without lawful status and are petitioning for lawfully admitted workers, which in part led to an increase in H-2A visa demand. Tourist and Business Visitors. State officials partly attributed the overall changes to tourist and business visitor visas to the extension of the validity period of such visas for Chinese nationals, which represented the largest single country of nationality for tourist and business visitor visas in fiscal year 2017 (17.7 percent). In November 2014, the United States and the People’s Republic of China reciprocally increased the validity periods of multiple-entry tourist and business visitor visas issued to each other’s citizens for up to 10 years. The change in policy was intended to support improved trade, investment, and business by facilitating travel between the two countries. According to State officials, extending validity periods can create an initial increase in demand for such visas, followed by a period of stabilization or even decline as NIV holders would be required to apply for renewal less frequently. According to State officials, in early fiscal year 2015, the increase in the validity period to 10 years for such visas created a spike in Chinese demand in fiscal year 2015, and by fiscal year 2016, the initial demand for these visas had been met and Chinese economic growth was simultaneously slowing, resulting in fewer adjudications for such visas in fiscal year 2017. State data for this time period indicate that the number of adjudications for tourist and business visitor visas for Chinese nationals increased from 1.58 million in fiscal year 2014 to 2.54 million in fiscal year 2015, followed by a decline to 2.34 million in fiscal year 2016 and 1.76 million in fiscal year 2017. Student and Exchange Visitors. Similar to tourist and business visitors, State officials partly attributed the overall changes in student and exchange visitor visa adjudications to the extension of the validity period of such visas for Chinese nationals, which represented the largest single country of nationality for student and exchange visitor visas in fiscal year 2017 (19 percent). In November 2014, the United States extended the validity period of the F visa for academic students from 1 year to 5 years. State officials noted that similar to tourist and business visitor visas, there was an initial surge in Chinese F-visa applicants due to the new 5-year F-visa validity period that began in fiscal year 2015, but the number dropped subsequently because Chinese students with such 5-year visas no longer needed to apply as frequently for F visas. State data for this time period indicate that the number of visa adjudications for F visas for Chinese nationals increased from about 267,000 in fiscal year 2014 to 301,000 in fiscal year 2015, followed by a decline of 172,000 in fiscal year 2016 and 134,000 in fiscal year 2017. Applicant’s Country of Nationality. In fiscal year 2017, more than half of all NIV adjudications were for applicants of six countries of nationality: China (2.02 million, or 16 percent), Mexico (1.75 million, or 14 percent), India (1.28 million, or 10 percent), Brazil (670,000, or 5 percent), Colombia (460,000, or 4 percent), and Argentina (370,000, or 3 percent), as shown in figure 6. Location of Adjudication. State data indicate that the geographic distribution of NIV adjudications across visa-issuing posts worldwide remained relatively consistent from fiscal years 2012 through 2017. NIV adjudications from visa-issuing posts in the Western Hemisphere comprised the largest proportion worldwide during this time period; however, this proportion decreased from 48.8 percent in fiscal year 2012 to 41.7 percent in fiscal year 2017. During the same time period, the proportion of NIV adjudications at visa-issuing posts in other regions increased slightly. For example, the percentage of NIV adjudications from posts in Africa increased from 3.8 percent to 5.5 percent, and the percentage of adjudications from posts in South and Central Asia increased from 7.9 percent to 11.2 percent from fiscal years 2012 through 2017. Figure 7 provides the proportion of NIV adjudications at visa- issuing posts from each region from fiscal years 2012 through 2017. The percentage of NIVs refused—known as the refusal rate—increased from fiscal years 2012 through 2016, and was about the same in fiscal year 2017 as the previous year. As shown in figure 8, the NIV refusal rate rose from about 14 percent in fiscal year 2012 to about 22 percent in fiscal year 2016, and remained about the same in fiscal year 2017; averaging about 18 percent over the time period. As a result, the total number of NIVs issued peaked in fiscal year 2015 at about 10.89 million, before falling in fiscal years 2016 and 2017 to 10.38 million and 9.68 million, respectively. The NIV refusal rate can fluctuate from year to year due to many factors. For example, according to State officials, removing a large, highly- qualified set of travelers from the NIV applicant population can drive up the statistical refusal rate. State officials also noted that when a country joins the Visa Waiver Program or a visa for certain nationalities increase from 1-year to 10-year visa validity periods, these individuals no longer apply for visas and affect the overall refusal rate. Further, State officials noted that changes in political and economic conditions in individual countries can affect visa eligibility, which in turn affects the overall refusal rate. State officials noted that the degree to which an applicant might seek to travel to the United States unlawfully is directly related to political, economic, and social conditions in their countries. For example, if global or regional economic conditions deteriorate, more applicants may have an incentive to come to the United States illegally by, for example, obtaining a NIV with the intent to unlawfully stay for a particular time period or purpose other than as permitted by their visa, which then would increase the number of NIV applications that consular officers are refusing. From fiscal years 2012 through 2017, the refusal rate varied by visa group. The highest refusal rate was for tourists and business visitors, which rose from about 15 percent in fiscal year 2012 to over 25 percent in fiscal year 2017, as shown in figure 9. Other visa categories, such as foreign officials and employees, transit and crewmembers, and fiancé(e)s and spouses, had refusal rates below 5 percent during this time period. State officials noted that because different visa categories have different eligibility and documentary requirements, they have different refusal rates. For example, F, J, and H visas require documentation of eligibility for student, exchange, or employment status, respectively. According to State data, while the majority of NIV refusals from fiscal years 2012 through 2017 were a result of consular officers finding the applicants ineligible, a relatively small number of refusals were due to terrorism and other security-related concerns. NIV applicants can be refused a visa on a number of grounds of inadmissibility or other ineligibility under U.S. immigration law and State policy. For the purposes of this report, we have grouped most of these grounds for refusal into one of seven categories, as shown in table 4. State data indicate the more than 90 percent of NIVs refused each year from fiscal years 2012 through 2017 were based on the consular officers’ determination that the applicants were ineligible nonimmigrants—in other words, the consular officers believed that the applicant was an intending immigrant seeking to stay permanently in the United States, which would generally violate NIV conditions, or that the applicant otherwise failed to demonstrate eligibility for the particular visa he or she was seeking. For example, an applicant applying for a student visa could be refused as an ineligible nonimmigrant for failure to demonstrate possession of sufficient funds to cover his or her educational expenses as required. Similarly, an applicant could be refused as an ineligible nonimmigrant for indicating to the consular officer an intention to obtain a student visa to engage in unsanctioned activities while in the United States, such as full-time employment instead of pursuing an approved course of study. According to State data, the second most common reason for refusal during this time period was inadequate documentation, which accounted for approximately 5 percent of refusals each year. In such cases, a consular officer determined that the application failed to include necessary documentation for the consular officer to ascertain whether the applicant was eligible to receive a visa at that time. If, for example, the applicant provides sufficient additional information in support of the application, a consular officer may subsequently issue the visa, as appropriate. Our analysis of State data indicates that relatively few applicants— approximately 0.05 percent—were refused for terrorism and other security-related reasons from fiscal years 2012 through 2017. Security- related reasons can include applicants who have engaged in genocide, espionage, or torture, among other grounds. Terrorism-related grounds of inadmissibility include when an applicant has engaged in or incited terrorist activity, is a member of a terrorist organization, or is the child or spouse of a foreign national who has been found inadmissible based on terrorist activity occurring within the last five years, among other reasons. As shown in figure 10, in fiscal year 2017, State data indicate that 1,256 refusals (or 0.05 percent) were based on terrorism and other security-related concerns, of which 357 refusals were specifically for terrorism-related reasons. In calendar year 2017, the President issued two executive orders and a presidential proclamation that required, among other actions, visa entry restrictions for nationals of certain countries of concern, a review of information needed for visa adjudication, and changes to visa (including NIV) screening and vetting protocols and procedures (see timeline in figure 11). Initially, the President issued Executive Order 13769, Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States (EO-1), in January 2017. In March 2017, the President revoked and replaced EO-1 with the issuance of Executive Order 13780 (EO-2), which had the same title as EO-1. Among other things, EO-2 suspended entry of certain foreign nationals for a 90 day period, subject to exceptions and waivers. It further directed federal agencies—including DHS, State, DOJ and ODNI—to review information needs from foreign governments for visa adjudication and develop uniform screening and vetting standards for U.S. entities to follow when adjudicating immigration benefits, including NIVs. In September 2017, as a result of the reviews undertaken pursuant to EO-2, the President issued Presidential Proclamation 9645, Enhancing Vetting Capabilities and Processes for Detecting Attempted Entry into the United States by Terrorists or Other Public-Safety Threats (Proclamation), which imposes certain conditional restrictions and limitations on the entry of nationals of eight countries—Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen—into the United States for an indefinite period. These restrictions are to remain in effect until the Secretaries of Homeland Security and State determine that a country provides sufficient information for the United States to assess adequately whether its nationals pose a security or safety threat. Challenges to both EOs and the Proclamation have affected their implementation and, while EO-2’s entry restrictions have expired, the visa entry restrictions outlined in the Proclamation continue to be fully implemented as of June 2018, consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court’s June 26, 2018, decision, which held that the President may lawfully establish nationality-based entry restrictions under the INA, and that Proclamation 9645 itself “is squarely within the scope of Presidential authority.” A more detailed listing of the executive actions and related challenges to those actions brought in the federal courts can be found in appendix III. Our analysis of State data indicates, out of the nearly 2.8 million NIV applications refused in fiscal year 2017, 1,338 were refused due to visa entry restrictions implemented in accordance with the executive actions. To implement the entry restrictions, in March 2017, State directed its consular officers to continue to accept all NIV applications and determine whether the applicant was otherwise eligible for a visa without regard to the applicable EO or Proclamation. If the applicant was ineligible for the visa on grounds unrelated to the executive action, such as having prior immigration violations, the applicant was to be refused on those grounds. If the applicant was otherwise eligible for the visa, but fell within the scope of the nationality-specific visa restrictions implemented pursuant to the applicable EO or Proclamation and was not eligible for a waiver or exception, the consular officer was to refuse the visa and enter a refusal code into State’s NIV database indicating that the applicant was refused solely due to the executive actions. More than 90 percent of the NIV applications refused in fiscal year 2017 pursuant to an executive action were for tourist and business visitor visas, and more than 5 percent were for students and exchange visitors. State data also indicate that the number of applications adjudicated for nationals of the 7 countries identified in EO-1—Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen—decreased by 22 percent in fiscal year 2017, as compared to a 7 percent general decrease in NIV adjudications worldwide that year. For example, as shown in table 5, the decrease in adjudications from fiscal years 2016 to 2017 for nationals of the 7 countries identified in EO-1 ranged from around 12 percent to more than 40 percent. As directed by the executive actions, DHS, State, DOJ, and ODNI took several steps to enhance NIV screening and vetting processes given their responsibilities for implementing the presidential actions. Among other things, the responsibilities included: (1) a review of information needed for visa adjudication; (2) the development of uniform screening standards for immigration programs; and (3) implementation of enhanced visa screening and vetting protocols and procedures. Review of information needed for visa adjudication. In accordance with EO-2, DHS conducted a worldwide review, in consultation with State and ODNI, to identify additional information needed from foreign countries to determine that an individual is not a security or public-safety threat when adjudicating an application for a visa, admission, or other immigration benefit. According to State officials, an interagency working group composed of State, DHS, ODNI, and National Security Council staff was formed to conduct the review. To conduct this review, DHS developed a set of criteria for information sharing in support of immigration screening and vetting, as shown by table 6. According to DHS officials, to develop these criteria, DHS, in coordination with other agencies, identified current standards and best practices for information collection and sharing under various categories of visas to create a core list of information needed from foreign governments in the visa adjudication process. For example, State sent an information request to all U.S. posts overseas requesting information on host nations’ information sharing practices, according to State officials. To assess the extent to which countries were meeting the newly established criteria, DHS officials stated that they used various information sources to preliminarily develop a list of countries that were or were not meeting the standards for adequate information sharing. For example, DHS officials stated that they reviewed information from INTERPOL on a country’s frequency of reporting lost and stolen passport information, consulted with ODNI for information on which countries are terrorist safe havens, and worked with State to obtain information that State officials at post may have on host nations’ information sharing practices. According to the Proclamation, based on DHS assessments of each country, DHS reported to the President on July 9, 2017, that 47 countries were “inadequate” or “at risk” of not meeting the standards. DHS officials identified several reasons that a country may have been assessed as “inadequate” with regard to the criteria. For example, some countries may have been willing to provide information, but lacked the capacity to do so. Or, some countries may not have been willing to provide certain information, or simply did not currently have diplomatic relations with the U.S. government. As was required by EO-2, State engaged with foreign governments on their respective performance based on these criteria for a 50-day period. In July 2017, State directed its posts to inform their respective host governments of the new information sharing criteria and request that host governments provide the required information or develop a plan to do so. Posts were directed to then engage more intensively with countries DHS’s report preliminarily deemed “inadequate” or “at risk”. Each post was to submit an assessment of mitigating factors or specific interests that should be considered in the deliberations regarding any travel restrictions for nationals of those countries. DHS officials stated that they reviewed the additional information host nations provided to State and then reevaluated the initial classifications to determine if any countries remained “inadequate.” On September 15, 2017, in accordance with EO-2, DHS submitted to the President a list of countries recommended for inclusion in a presidential proclamation that would prohibit certain categories of foreign nationals of such countries from entering the United States. The countries listed were Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen— which were assessed as “inadequate,” and Somalia, which was identified as a terrorist safe haven. The Presidential Proclamation indefinitely suspended entry into the United States of certain nonimmigrants from the listed countries (see table 7) and directed DHS, in consultation with State, to devise a process to assess whether the entry restrictions should be continued, modified or terminated. In September 2017, State issued additional guidance to posts on implementation of the Presidential Proclamation. As of July 2018, State continues to accept and process the NIV applications of foreign nationals from the eight countries covered by the Proclamation. Such applicants are to be interviewed, according to State guidance, and consular officers are to determine if the applicant is otherwise eligible for the visa, meets any of the proclamation’s exceptions, or qualifies for a waiver. Development of uniform screening standards for U.S. immigration benefit programs. Consistent with EO-2, State, DHS, DOJ, and ODNI developed a uniform baseline for screening and vetting standards and procedures by the U.S. government. According to State officials, an interagency working group comprised of State, DHS, DOJ, and ODNI staff is implementing these requirements. Based on its review of existing screening and vetting processes, DHS officials stated that the working group established uniform standards for (1) applications, (2) interviews, and (3) security system checks (i.e., biographic and biometric). Regarding applications, DHS officials stated that the group identified data elements against which applicants are to be screened and vetted. In February 2018, DHS Office of Policy officials stated that they had taken steps to create more consistency across U.S. government forms that collect information used for screening and vetting purposes, such as State’s DS-160 NIV application as well as 12 DHS forms. For example, officials stated that they anticipate issuing Federal Register notices announcing the intended changes to such forms. Regarding interviews, DHS officials stated that the working group established a requirement for all applicants seeking an immigration benefit, including NIV applicants, to undergo a baseline uniform national security and public safety interview. DHS officials stated that the working group modeled its interview baseline on elements of the refugee screening interview. To help implement this standard, DHS officials stated that the department is offering more training courses in enhanced communications (i.e. detecting deception and eliciting responses) and making such courses accessible to other U.S. government entities and U.S. officials overseas. Regarding security checks, the working group identified certain checks that should be conducted for all applicants seeking an immigration benefit, including NIV applicants. For example, DHS officials stated that the working group concluded that all applicants for U.S. immigration benefits should be screened against DHS’s TECS, among other federal databases. In February 2018, DHS Office of Policy officials stated that they were also exploring the extent to which current screening and vetting technologies can be expanded. For example, technology that is being used to screen applicants for counterterrorism concerns can potentially be modified to screen applicants for other concerns such as public safety or participation in transnational organized crime. However, these officials noted such changes to technology can take a long time. DHS officials stated that each department and agency is responsible for implementing the uniform standards for their relevant immigration programs. For example, with regard to maintaining information electronically, State officials stated that for nonimmigrant and immigrant visas, as of May 2018, they collected most, but not all, of the application data elements. In addition to executive actions taken in calendar year 2017, the President issued National Security Presidential Memorandum 9 on February 6, 2018, which directed DHS, in coordination with State, DOJ, and ODNI, to establish a National Vetting Center to optimize the use of federal government information in support of the national vetting enterprise. This memorandum stated that the U.S. government must develop an integrated approach to the use of intelligence and other data, across national security components, in order to improve how departments and agencies coordinate and use information to identify individuals presenting a threat to national security, border security, homeland security, or public safety. The center is to be overseen and guided by a National Vetting Governance Board, consisting of six senior executives designated by DHS, DOJ, ODNI, State, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Department of Defense. Further, within 180 days of the issuance of the memorandum, these six departments and agencies, in coordination with the Office of Management and Budget, are to jointly submit to the President for approval an implementation plan for the center, addressing, among other things, the initial scope of the center’s vetting activities; the roles and responsibilities of agencies participating in the center; a resourcing strategy for the center; and a projected schedule to reach both initial and full operational capability. On February 14, 2018, the Secretary of Homeland Security selected an official to serve as the Director of the National Vetting Center and delegated the center’s authorities to CBP. DHS Office of Policy officials stated in February 2018 that the center is intended to serve as the focal point of the larger screening and vetting enterprise, and will coordinate policy and set priorities. The center will use the uniform baselines for screening and vetting standards and procedures established per EO-2 to set short- and long-term priorities to improve screening and vetting across the U.S. government. Further, these officials stated screening and vetting activities will continue to be implemented by the entities that are currently implementing such efforts, but roles and responsibilities for screening and vetting for immigration benefits may be modified in the future based on the work of the center. According to DHS Office of Policy officials, efforts to implement National Security Presidential Memorandum 9, such as the development of an implementation plan, are ongoing as of June 2018. Implementation of new visa screening and vetting protocols and procedures. In response to the EOs and a March 2017 presidential memorandum issued the same day as EO-2, State has taken several actions to implement new visa screening and vetting protocols and procedures. For example, State sought and received emergency approval from the Office of Management and Budget in May 2017 to develop a new form, the DS-5535. The form collects additional information from a subset of visa applicants to more rigorously evaluate applicants for visa ineligibilities, including those related to national security and terrorism. The new information requested includes the applicant’s travel history over the prior 15 years, all phone numbers used over the prior 15 years, and all email addresses and social media handles used in the last 5 years. State estimated that, across all posts, the groups requiring additional vetting represented about 70,500 individuals per year. We provided a draft of the sensitive version of this report to DHS, DOJ, State, and ODNI. DHS, DOJ, and State provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until seven days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies of this report to the Secretaries of Homeland Security and State, the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-8777or GamblerR@gao.gov. Key contributors to this report are listed in appendix IV. There are many nonimmigrant visas (NIV), which are issued to foreign nationals such as tourists, business visitors, and students seeking temporary admission into the United States. For the purposes of this report, we placed the majority of NIVs into one of seven groups. In the following enclosures, we provide a descriptive overview of each group on the basis of our analysis of the Department of State’s (State) fiscal years 2012 through 2017 NIV data. Each enclosure also contains the following: Description of the group. In this section, we provide a narrative description of the group, as well as a table of the specific NIVs that comprise the group. Characteristics of the applicants. In this section, we provide the number of annual NIV adjudications for fiscal years 2012 through 2017, the specific NIVs adjudicated in fiscal year 2017 within the group, the regions to which applicants applied for these NIVs in fiscal year 2017, and the top five nationalities that applied for NIVs in the group in fiscal year 2017. Issuances. In this section, we provide the number of NIVs issued within this group for fiscal years 2012 through 2017. Refusals. In this section, we provide the refusal rate for the entire NIV group for fiscal years 2012 through 2017. For the NIVs that were refused in fiscal year 2017 for this group, we also provide the top ground for refusal. NIV applicants can be refused a visa on a number of grounds of inadmissibility or other ineligibility under U.S. immigration law and State policy. However, across all visa groups, the top categories were either ineligible nonimmigrant or inadequate documentation: Ineligible nonimmigrant. For most NIV categories, the applicant is presumed to be an intending immigrant until the applicant establishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer that he or she is entitled to a nonimmigrant status. An applicant may be refused under this provision if, among other things, the consular officer determines the applicant lacks sufficient ties to his or her home country, or intends to abandon foreign residence; that evidence otherwise indicates an intent to immigrate to the United States permanently; or that the applicant is likely to violate the terms of the visa after being admitted. Inadequate documentation. The consular officer determined that the application is not in compliance with the INA because, for example, it lacks necessary documentation to allow the consular officer to determine visa eligibility. In such cases, the applicant would not be found eligible for the visa unless and until satisfactory documentation is provided to the consular officer or after the completion of administrative processing, such as security advisory opinions.

The Department of State (State) is generally responsible for the adjudication of NIV applications, and manages the application process, including the consular officer corps and its functions at more than 220 U.S. embassies and consulates (i.e., visa-issuing posts) overseas. Depending on various factors, such as the particular NIV sought, the applicant’s background, and visa demand, State officials noted that the length of the visa adjudication process can vary from a single day to months. This appendix provides descriptive statistics of NIV adjudications, issuances, and refusals for fiscal years 2012 through 2017. Specific details are shown in table 8 below. State data from fiscal years 2012 through 2016 indicate that NIV adjudications generally followed an annual cycle, ebbing during certain months during the fiscal year; however, adjudications in fiscal year 2017 departed slightly from this trend. Specifically, from fiscal years 2012 through 2016, the number of NIV adjudications typically reached its highest peak in the summer months, as shown in table 9. For example, State officials noted that a summer peak is generally due to international students who are applying for their visas for the coming academic year. There are many NIVs, and for the purposes of this report, we have placed the majority of NIVs into one of seven groups. Table 10 includes the annual NIV adjudications, issuances, and refusal rates, for each visa group for fiscal years 2012 through 2017. NIV applicants seeking to travel to the United States represent many different nationalities, but the countries of nationality with the most NIV adjudications have remained relatively consistent in recent years. Table 11 provides the top 25 countries of nationality for NIV adjudications for fiscal years 2012 through 2017. NIV applicants can apply for their NIVs at more than 220 visa-issuing U.S. posts overseas. Table 12 describes the regions to which NIV applicants applied from fiscal years 2012 through 2017. NIV applicants can be refused a visa on a number of grounds of inadmissibility or other ineligibility under U.S. immigration law and State policy. For the purposes of this report, we have grouped most of these grounds for refusal into one of seven categories, and group the remaining into a miscellaneous category, as shown in table 13. From January through October 2017, the administration took various executive actions establishing nationality-based entry restrictions for certain categories of foreign nationals from designated countries. This appendix supplements information included in this report to provide a more comprehensive presentation of changes to U.S. immigration policy affecting nonimmigrant and immigrant entry into the United States, and outlines the legal standards applied, and precedent developed and relied upon, by federal courts in resolving challenges to the executive actions. In particular, it describes relevant aspects of the executive actions specifically addressed in this report—Executive Orders 13769 and 13780, both titled Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States, and Presidential Proclamation 9645, Enhancing Vetting Capabilities and Processes for Detecting Attempted Entry into the United States by Terrorists or Other Public-Safety Threats—that imposed visa entry restrictions on certain countries’ nationals and included provisions addressing NIV screening and vetting, as well as other executive actions on immigration issued by the current administration. Furthermore, this appendix provides a detailed account of the interrelated challenges to these executive actions brought in the federal courts through June 2018. In summary, on March 6, 2017, the President issued Executive Order (EO) 13780, Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States, which instituted visa and refugee entry restrictions, and an accompanying memorandum addressed to the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security and the Attorney General, calling for heightened screening and vetting of visa applications and other immigration benefits. EO 13780 stated that it is U.S. policy to improve the screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with the visa-issuance process and U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). Enforcement of sections 2(c) and 6(a) of EO 13780 which established visa entry restrictions for nationals of six countries of particular concern—Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen—for a 90-day period, and suspended all refugee admissions for 120 days, was enjoined by federal district court orders issued in March 2017. On appeal, the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the Fourth and Ninth Circuits generally upheld these decisions. Upon review by the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2017, the injunction was partially lifted except with respect to foreign nationals who have bona fide ties to the United States Implementation of EO 13780 commenced on June 29, 2017. On September 24, 2017, pursuant to section 2(e) of EO 13780, the President issued Presidential Proclamation 9645, Enhancing Vetting Capabilities and Processes for Detecting Attempted Entry Into the United States by Terrorists or Other Public-Safety Threats. This proclamation restricts entry into the United States of certain categories of foreign nationals from eight countries—Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen—for an indefinite period. Preliminary injunctions issued by the U.S. District Courts for the Districts of Maryland (Maryland federal district court) and Hawaii (Hawaii federal district court) in October 2017 prohibited implementation of these visa entry restrictions except with respect to North Korean and Venezuelan nationals. On December 4, 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court issued two orders staying these district court injunctions; and on January 19, 2018, the Supreme Court granted the government’s petition for review of the December 22, 2017, decision of the Ninth Circuit, which partially affirmed the Hawaii federal district court’s preliminary injunction. As of June 2018, these latest visa entry restrictions continue to be fully implemented consistent with the Supreme Court’s June 26, 2018, decision, which held that the President may lawfully establish nationality-based entry restrictions, and that Proclamation 9645 itself “is squarely within the scope of Presidential authority.” The following sections describe these executive actions and related litigation in greater detail. On January 27, 2017, the President issued EO 13769, Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States, which directed a review of information needs for adjudicating visas and other immigration benefits to confirm individuals seeking such benefits are who they claim to be, and are not security or public-safety threats. To temporarily reduce investigative burdens during the review period, the EO suspended U.S. entry for nationals of seven countries of particular concern—Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. In addition, EO 13769 put USRAP on hold for 120 days and indefinitely barred admission of Syrian refugees. Shortly after its issuance, however, the EO faced numerous legal challenges in federal courts across the country involving various constitutional and statutory issues such as detainee applications for writs of habeas corpus, alleged religious or nationality-based discrimination, and the extent of the EO’s applicability to certain categories of foreign nationals, including U.S. lawful permanent residents (LPR) and dual nationals holding passports issued by a listed country as well as another nation not subject to visa entry restrictions. On February 3, 2017, the Washington federal district court entered a nationwide temporary restraining order (TRO) prohibiting enforcement of the EO’s entry restrictions. In rejecting the government’s argument that a TRO only cover the particular states at issue, the court reasoned that partial implementation would “undermine the constitutional imperative of ‘a uniform Rule of Naturalization’ and Congress’s instruction that the ‘immigration laws of the United States should be enforced vigorously and uniformly.’” On February 9, 2017, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the nationwide injunction, thereby denying the government’s emergency motion for a stay of the Washington federal district court’s TRO pending appeal, because the government did not show a likelihood of success on the merits of its appeal, or that failure to enter a stay would cause irreparable injury. On March 6, 2017, however, the President issued EO 13780, which revoked and replaced EO 13769, and established revised restrictions on entry for nationals of the same countries of particular concern, except Iraq. On March 6, 2017, the President signed EO 13780, Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States, which revoked and replaced EO 13769 and put in place revised visa and refugee entry restrictions, and issued an accompanying memorandum calling for heightened screening and vetting of visa applications and other immigration benefits. In general, sections 2(c) and 6(a) of EO 13780 barred visa travel for nationals of six designated countries—Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen—for 90 days, and all refugee admission for 120 days. On March 15, 2017, sections 2 and 6 of the EO were enjoined on statutory grounds (i.e., based on potential violation of U.S. immigration law) pursuant to the order of the Hawaii federal district court granting the plaintiffs’ motion for a TRO. On March 16, 2017, the Maryland federal district court issued a preliminary injunction barring implementation of visa entry restrictions on a nationwide basis with respect to nationals of the six listed countries. On May 25, 2017, the Fourth Circuit affirmed the Maryland federal district court’s injunction on constitutional grounds (i.e., based on potential violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution). On June 12, 2017, the Ninth Circuit generally affirmed the Hawaii federal district court’s ruling, but vacated the district court’s order to the extent it enjoined internal review procedures not burdening individuals outside the Executive Branch, therefore permitting the administration to conduct the internal reviews of visa information needs as directed in the EO. On June 14, 2017, the President issued a memorandum to the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security, Attorney General, and Director of National Intelligence, directing that sections 2 and 6 of EO 13780 were to be implemented 72 hours after all applicable injunctions are lifted or stayed. On June 26, 2017, the Supreme Court granted, in part, the government’s application to stay the March 15 and 16 injunctions of the Hawaii and Maryland federal district courts, as generally upheld on May 25 and June 12 by the Fourth and Ninth Circuits. The Court explained that the administration may enforce visa and refugee travel restrictions under sections 2 and 6 except with respect to an individual who can “credibly claim a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.” In the case of a visa or refugee applicant who is the relative of a person in the United States, such foreign national would be exempt from entry restrictions provided the family connection with their U.S. relative meets the “close familial relationship” standard. The Court further explained that a qualifying relationship with a U.S. entity would have to be formal, documented, and formed in the ordinary course, and not for the purpose of evading EO 13780. On June 29, 2017, the day that implementation of EO 13780 began, the State Department issued guidance providing that a close familial relationship exists for the parents, spouse, children, adult sons or daughters, sons and daughters-in-law, and siblings of a person in the United States, but not for such person’s grandparents, grandchildren, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, sisters-in-law, brothers-in-law or other relatives. The State of Hawaii filed a motion with the Hawaii federal district court seeking, among other things, a declaration that the partial injunction in place after the Supreme Court’s ruling prohibited application of travel restrictions to fiancés, grandparents, grandchildren, brothers and sisters in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and cousins of persons in the United States. On July 13, 2017, the Hawaii federal district court ruled, among other things, that section 2 of the EO, generally barring travel to the United States for nationals of certain countries, does not apply to the grandparents, grandchildren, brothers and sisters in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins of persons in the United States, who were initially excluded from the administration’s interpretation of “close family.” The government appealed this decision to the Supreme Court. On July 19, 2017, the Supreme Court denied the government’s motion seeking further clarification of its June 26 ruling, stayed the Hawaii federal district court’s order to the extent it included refugees covered by a formal assurance from a U.S.-based resettlement agency within the scope of the preliminary injunction, pending appeal to the Ninth Circuit, and left unchanged the district court’s broader formulation of exempt “close family.” On September 7, 2017, the Ninth Circuit upheld the Hawaii federal district court’s definition of close family members who are not to be subjected to travel restrictions, and rejected the government’s argument that refugees who had undergone a stringent review process and been approved by U.S.-based resettlement agencies lack a bona fide relationship to the United States, thus allowing admission of such refugees. On September 11, 2017, the Supreme Court temporarily enjoined aspects of the Hawaii federal district court’s holding that would permit admission of certain refugees with formal assurances from a U.S. resettlement entity. The next day, on September 12, 2017, the Supreme Court indefinitely stayed the Ninth Circuit’s September 7 ruling with respect to refugees covered by a formal assurance, thereby permitting the administration to suspend entry of such refugees. On September 24, 2017, pursuant to section 2(e) of EO 13780, the President issued Presidential Proclamation 9645, Enhancing Vetting Capabilities and Processes for Detecting Attempted Entry Into the United States by Terrorists or Other Public Safety Threats, which expanded the scope and duration of visa entry restrictions from six to eight countries, and from a 90-day to an indefinite period for the listed countries. On September 25, 2017, in light of the September 24 proclamation, the Supreme Court directed the parties to file briefs addressing whether, or to what extent, the cases before it regarding EO 13780 are moot. On October 10, 2017, after receiving the parties’ supplemental briefs, the Supreme Court decided that because section 2(c) of EO 13780 expired on September 24, there was no live case or controversy; and without expressing a view on the merits, the Court vacated and remanded the Maryland case to the Fourth Circuit with instructions to dismiss as moot the challenge to EO 13780. On October 24, 2017, consistent with its October 10 ruling, the Supreme Court also vacated and remanded the Hawaii case related to EO 13780 to the Ninth Circuit with instructions to dismiss it as moot. Consequently, after challenges to EO 13780 visa and refugee entry restrictions, as curtailed by the Supreme Court’s ruling of June 26, 2017, were rendered moot, litigation continued with respect to the President’s proclamation of September 24, 2017. On September 24, 2017, pursuant to section 2(e) of EO 13780, the President issued Presidential Proclamation 9645 (the Proclamation), Enhancing Vetting Capabilities and Processes for Detecting Attempted Entry Into the United States by Terrorists or Other Public-Safety Threats, which imposes certain conditional restrictions and limitations on entry into the United States of nationals of eight countries—Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen—for an indefinite period. According to the Proclamation, travel restrictions are tailored to each nation’s information sharing and identity management deficiencies based on standard immigration screening and vetting criteria established by the Secretary of Homeland Security, and are to remain in effect until such time as the Secretaries of Homeland Security and State determine that a country provides sufficient information for the United States to assess adequately whether its nationals pose a security or safety threat. On October 17, 2017, the Hawaii federal district court issued a TRO, on statutory grounds, enjoining on a nationwide basis the implementation and enforcement of travel restrictions provided for under the Proclamation, except with respect to North Korean or Venezuelan nationals. On the same day, the Maryland federal district court granted in part plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction, primarily on constitutional grounds, thereby prohibiting implementation of visa entry restrictions nationwide, except for nationals of North Korea and Venezuela as well as other covered foreign nationals who lack a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States. On October 20, 2017, the Hawaii federal district court converted its October 17 TRO into a preliminary injunction, thereby continuing the nationwide prohibition on enforcement or implementation of the suspension on entry for nationals of Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen. The district court did not stay its ruling or hold it in abeyance should an appeal be filed in the Ninth Circuit. On November 13, 2017, the Ninth Circuit granted, in part, the government’s request for an emergency stay of the Hawaii federal district court’s preliminary injunction, thereby allowing visa entry restrictions to go into effect with respect to the nationals of Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen. However, consistent with the Supreme Court’s June 2017 ruling, the court ordered that those with a bone fide relationship to a person or entity in the United States not be subject to such travel restrictions. On November 20, 2017, the government petitioned the Supreme Court for a stay of the preliminary injunction issued by the Hawaii federal district court, pending consideration and disposition of the government’s appeal from that injunction to the Ninth Circuit and, if that court affirms the injunction, pending filing and disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari and any further proceedings in the Supreme Court. On November 28, 2017, plaintiffs in the challenge to the Proclamation arising out of Hawaii asked that the Supreme Court deny the government’s request to lift the partial injunction left in place by the Ninth Circuit. On the same day, plaintiffs in the case arising out of Maryland requested that the Supreme Court not grant a stay of the federal district court’s preliminary injunction. In both cases, plaintiffs assert that the more expansive visa entry restrictions violate U.S. immigration law; additionally, for the Maryland case, plaintiffs argue that such restrictions are unconstitutional as a form of discrimination based on national origin. On December 4, 2017, the Supreme Court issued two orders staying the Maryland and Hawaii federal district courts’ orders of October 17 and 20 that preliminarily enjoined implementation of the Proclamation, pending decisions of the Ninth and Fourth Circuits in the government’s appeals, and of the Supreme Court regarding a petition for a writ of certiorari (if sought). As a result, the Proclamation’s visa entry restrictions were permitted to go into full effect unless and until they are either enjoined by the courts of appeals and a writ of certiorari is not sought thereafter, or the Supreme Court either denies a petition for certiorari (thereby resulting in termination of the Supreme Court’s stay order) or grants such petition followed by a final injunction prohibiting current or future implementation of the Proclamation’s restrictions. The Supreme Court further noted its expectation that the courts of appeals will render decisions “with appropriate dispatch,” in light of both courts having decided to consider their respective cases on an expedited basis. On December 8, 2017, the Department of State announced that it began fully implementing the Proclamation, as permitted by the Supreme Court, at the opening of business at U.S. embassies and consulates overseas. On December 22, 2017, the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part and vacated in part the Hawaii federal district court’s October 20 order enjoining enforcement of visa entry restrictions under the Proclamation, while limiting the preliminary injunction’s scope to foreign nationals who have a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States. Without reaching plaintiffs’ constitutional claims, the court of appeals concluded that the Proclamation exceeded the scope of authority delegated to the President by Congress under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), in particular, sections 202(a)(1)(A) (immigrant visa nondiscrimination) and 212(f) (presidential suspension of, or imposition of restrictions on, alien entry), by deviating from statutory text, legislative history and prior executive practice; not including the requisite finding that entry of certain foreign nationals would be detrimental to U.S. interests; and contravening the INA’s prohibition on nationality-based discrimination in the issuance of immigrant visas. However, the court stayed its decision, given that the Supreme Court’s December 4 order lifted the federal district courts’ injunctions pending not only review by the courts of appeals, but also “disposition of the Government’s petition for a writ of certiorari, if such writ is sought.” On January 5, 2018, the government filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking review of the December 22, 2017, judgment of the Ninth Circuit which left in place the Hawaii federal district court injunction of the Proclamation’s visa entry restrictions for individuals with bona fide ties to the United States. On January 19, 2018, the Supreme Court granted the government’s certiorari petition and will therefore consider, and issue an opinion on the merits of, the Ninth Circuit’s decision. On February 15, 2018, the Fourth Circuit affirmed the preliminary injunction granted by the Maryland federal district court on constitutional grounds, but stayed its decision pending the outcome of the Ninth Circuit case before the Supreme Court. The court of appeals found that “laintiffs offer undisputed evidence that the President has openly and often expressed his desire” to bar the entry of Muslims into the United States. Therefore, the court concluded that, in light of the President’s official statements, the Proclamation likely violates the Establishment Clause as it “fails to demonstrate a primarily secular purpose,” and also goes against the basic principle that government is not to act with religious animus. On February 23, 2018, Fourth Circuit challengers filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking for the Supreme Court to consolidate their case with the Court’s ongoing review of the Ninth Circuit decision. These petitioners requested that the Court additionally consider their argument that the preliminary injunction should not have been limited to individuals with a bona fide relationship to a person or entity in the United States. On February 26, 2018, the Supreme Court granted Fourth Circuit petitioners’ motion to expedite consideration of their certiorari petition. On April 10, 2018, the President issued a proclamation announcing that because Chad has improved its identity-management and information sharing practices sufficiently to meet U.S. baseline security standards, nationals of Chad will again be able to receive visas for travel to the United States. On June 26, 2018, the Supreme Court held that the President lawfully exercised the broad discretion granted to him under INA § 212(f) (presidential suspension of, or imposition of restrictions on, alien entry), by issuing Proclamation No. 9645, which established nationality-based visa entry restrictions applicable to categories of foreign nationals from eight (now seven) countries for an indefinite period. In addition, while three individual plaintiffs had standing to bring an Establishment Clause challenge to entry restrictions prohibiting their relatives from coming to the United States, the Court found the Proclamation to be legitimate on its face as a way to prevent entry of certain foreign nationals where the government determines there is insufficient information for visa vetting. As a result of the Supreme Court’s June 26, 2018, decision, which held that the establishment of nationality-based entry restrictions is a lawful exercise of the President’s broad discretion in matters of immigration and national security, the visa entry restrictions imposed on categories of foreign nationals from certain countries pursuant to Presidential Proclamation 9645 continue to be fully implemented , as they have been since the Supreme Court’s December 4, 2017, orders staying the lower courts’ injunctions. On October 24, 2017, the same day the 120-day suspension of refugee admissions under EO 13780 expired, the President signed EO 13815, Resuming the United States Refugee Admissions program With Enhanced Vetting Capabilities, which resumed USRAP and directed that special measures be applied to certain categories of refugees posing potential threats to the security and welfare of the United States. On December 23, 2017, the Washington federal district court issued a nationwide preliminary injunction on aspects of EO 13815 (and its accompanying memorandum), thus prohibiting the administration from: (1) temporarily suspending admission of refugees from 11 previously identified countries of concern, and reallocating resources from the processing of their applications during the 90-day review period (except for those lacking a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States); and (2) indefinitely barring admission of, and application processing for, all following-to-join refugees. On January 5, 2018, the Washington federal district court denied the government’s motion for reconsideration of the court’s December 23, 2017, order temporarily halting enforcement of refugee entry restrictions that were to be implemented as part of the resumption of USRAP under the EO. Specifically, the government “ask the court to ‘modify its preliminary injunction to exclude from coverage refugee applicants who seek to establish a on the sole ground that they have received a formal assurance from a resettlement agency.’” In denying the government’s motion for reconsideration, the court relied on the September 7, 2017, decision of the Ninth Circuit which, among other things, rejected the notion that refugees with formal assurances from U.S.-based resettlement agencies do not meet the Supreme Court’s bona fide relationship standard. The court treated this Ninth Circuit ruling as binding precedent given that the Supreme Court’s indefinite stay of September 12 neither vacated the Ninth Circuit’s decision, nor provided any underlying reason(s) that would allow another court to discern its rationale. On January 9, 2018, the Washington federal district court also denied the government’s emergency motion for a stay of the court’s December 23, 2017, preliminary injunction, pending appeal to the Ninth Circuit. On January 31, 2018, DHS announced additional security measures to prevent exploitation of USRAP. Specifically, these security measures include additional screening for certain nationals of high-risk countries, a more risk-based approach to administering USRAP, and a periodic review and update of the refugee high-risk countries list and selection criteria. Therefore, as of June 2018, while the administration has announced additional security measures to strengthen the integrity of USRAP, the Washington federal district court’s December 23, 2017, preliminary injunction of EO 13815 continues to: (1) prohibit implementation of the temporary suspension of admission, and reallocation of resources from processing applications, of refugees from 11 previously identified countries of concern; and (2) forbid enforcement of the indefinite bar on entry of following-to-join refugees. In addition to the contact named above, Kathryn Bernet (Assistant Director), Colleen Corcoran, Eric Hauswirth, Thomas Lombardi, Amanda Miller, Sasan J. “Jon” Najmi, Erin O’Brien, Garrett Riba, and Dina Shorafa made significant contributions to this report.\n\n","[""Previous attempted and successful terrorist attacks against the United States have raised questions about the security of the U.S. government's process for adjudicating NIVs, which are issued to foreign nationals, such as tourists, business visitors, and students, seeking temporary admission into the United States. For example, the December 2015 shootings in San Bernardino, California, led to concerns about NIV screening and vetting processes because one of the attackers was admitted into the United States under a NIV. In 2017, the President issued executive actions directing agencies to improve visa screening and vetting, and establishing nationality-based visa entry restrictions, which the Supreme Court upheld in June 2018. GAO was asked to review NIV screening and vetting. This report examines (1) outcomes and characteristics of adjudicated NIV applications from fiscal years 2012 through 2017, and (2) key changes made to the NIV adjudication process in response to executive actions taken in 2017. GAO analyzed State NIV adjudication data for fiscal years 2012 through 2017, the most recent and complete data available. GAO visited seven consular posts selected based on visa workload and other factors. GAO reviewed relevant executive orders and proclamations, and documents related to implementing these actions. This is a public version of a sensitive report issued in June 2018. Information that DHS, State, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence deemed sensitive has been removed. The total number of nonimmigrant visa (NIV) applications that Department of State (State) consular officers adjudicated annually peaked at about 13.4 million in fiscal year 2016, and decreased by about 880,000 adjudications in fiscal year 2017. NIV adjudications varied by visa group, country of nationality, and refusal reason: Visa group. From fiscal years 2012 through 2017, about 80 percent of NIV adjudications were for tourists and business visitors. During this time, adjudications for temporary workers increased by about 50 percent and decreased for students and exchange visitors by about 2 percent. Country of nationality. In fiscal year 2017, more than half of all NIV adjudications were for applicants of six countries of nationality: China (2.02 million, or 16 percent), Mexico (1.75 million, or 14 percent), India (1.28 million, or 10 percent), Brazil (670,000, or 5 percent), Colombia (460,000, or 4 percent), and Argentina (370,000, or 3 percent). Refusal reason. State data indicate that over this time period, 18 percent of adjudicated applications were refused; more than 90 percent were because the applicant did not qualify for the visa sought, and a small percentage (0.05 percent) were due to terrorism and security-related concerns. In 2017, two executive orders and a proclamation issued by the President required, among other actions, visa entry restrictions for nationals of certain listed countries of concern, the development of uniform baseline screening and vetting standards, and changes to NIV screening and vetting procedures. GAO's analysis of State data indicates that, out of the nearly 2.8 million NIV applications refused in fiscal year 2017, 1,338 applications were refused due to visa entry restrictions implemented per the executive actions. State, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and others developed standards for screening and vetting by the U.S. government for all immigration benefits, such as for the requirement for applicants to undergo certain security checks. Further, State sought and received emergency approval from the Office of Management and Budget in May 2017 to develop a new form to collect additional information from some visa applicants, such as email addresses and social media handles.""]","11506","gov_report","en","None","aa553d37bf5e68ec9f38976761e2c37ea3495ef11650ce0d","Summary:","gov_report","532","\nThe report:\nThe U.S. government has implemented various visa and immigration policies to screening and vetting procedures to ensure the safety and security of the U.S. citizens.

"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nThe federal government has recognized 573 Indian tribes as distinct, independent political communities with tribal sovereignty. There are different categories of tribal lands, with differing implications with respect to ownership and administration. Reservations are defined geographic areas with established boundaries recognized by the United States. Tribal lands vary in size, demographics, and location. For example, those lands smallest in size are less than one square mile, and the largest, the Navajo Nation, is more than 24,000 square miles (the size of West Virginia). Tribal land locations can range from extremely remote, rural locations to urban areas. Figure 1 shows tribal lands in the United States according to the 2010 Census. The term “broadband” commonly refers to Internet access that is high speed and provides an “always-on” connection, so users do not have to reestablish a connection each time they access the Internet. Broadband service may be “fixed”—that is, providing service to a single location, such as a customer’s home—or “mobile,” that is, providing service wherever a customer has access to a mobile wireless network, including while on the move, through a mobile device, such as a smartphone. Fixed and mobile broadband providers deploy and maintain infrastructure to connect consumers to the Internet. Providers offer fixed Internet service through a number of technologies, such as copper phone lines, fiber-optic lines, coaxial cables, wireless antennas, satellites, or a mix of technologies (see fig. 2). To install fixed or wireless infrastructure, providers must obtain permits from government entities with jurisdiction over the land or permission from public utilities to deploy infrastructure on existing utility poles. The federal government has emphasized the importance of ensuring Americans have access to broadband, and a number of agencies, including FCC, currently provide funding to subsidize broadband deployment in areas in which the return on investment has not attracted private investment. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, specifies that consumers in “rural, insular, and high-cost areas” should have access to telecommunication services and rates that are “reasonably comparable” to consumers in urban areas. To achieve this goal, FCC administers the High-Cost program, which provides subsidies to providers of phone service in rural, insular, and other remote areas. In 2011, FCC launched a series of reforms to its High-Cost program, including adding support for broadband services, and created the Connect America Fund, which provides subsidies to fixed and mobile providers of telecommunications and broadband services in rural, insular, and other remote areas where the costs of providing service is high. To be eligible for Universal Service Fund support from FCC, a provider must be designated an Eligible Telecommunications Carrier by the appropriate state or by FCC and must meet certain service obligations. The Connect America Fund has distributed approximately $4.5 billion per year, and has separate funding mechanisms targeted to specific goals. For example, there are funds for fixed-phone and broadband service and funds for mobile service, including a Tribal Mobility Fund (Phase 1) that awarded nearly $50 million in 2014 for the provision of 3G and 4G service to unserved tribal areas. In addition to FCC, a number of other agencies provide funding for broadband deployment in unserved or underserved areas. For example, the United States Department of Agriculture’s Community Connect Program, which provides grants to rural communities to provide high- speed Internet service to unserved areas. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) mandated the development of a nationwide map of broadband availability. To implement the act, the National Telecommunications & Information Administration (NTIA)—an agency within the Department of Commerce—established a grant program to enable U.S. states and territories to collect state-level broadband mapping data. NTIA used these data to launch the National Broadband Map (www.broadbandmap.gov) in February 2011. As the funding for the NTIA’s program came to an end in 2014, NTIA stopped collecting data to update the map and, according to FCC officials, created a memorandum of understanding with FCC through which FCC agreed to maintain public access to the last version of the map. FCC issued rules in 2013 to begin collecting broadband deployment data, in addition to the broadband subscription data it had collected from providers since 2000. FCC sought, but did not receive, $3 million to update the National Broadband Map in its fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2016 budgets. In 2018, Congress directed FCC to develop a report by March 23, 2019, evaluating broadband coverage in certain tribal lands (to include an assessment of areas that have adequate broadband coverage, as well as an assessment of unserved areas), and to complete a proceeding to address unserved areas by September 23, 2020. Currently, FCC requires broadband providers to report on their broadband deployment by filing a form twice a year (Form 477). Fixed broadband providers submit a list of the census blocks in which their broadband service is available, and mobile providers submit “shapefiles”—a geospatial depiction of the coverage area, which FCC refers to as “polygons”—of their coverage areas. FCC uses providers’ 477 data to develop a statutorily mandated annual report on advanced telecommunications capability. In addition, in 2016, FCC began publishing its own maps of broadband deployment, using the information from providers’ Form 477 filings. In February 2018, FCC launched an updated map of fixed broadband deployment (https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/#/). This map allows users to search for broadband deployment by address and provides summary-level statistics regarding broadband deployment in specific tribal lands (see fig. 3). According to FCC officials, this new map format will support more frequent data updates. FCC also provides national maps of mobile LTE coverage; these maps do not allow users to access data at the same level of granularity as the maps of fixed broadband (see fig. 4). FCC collects and uses data that capture broadband availability to measure broadband access on tribal lands, leading to overstatements of broadband access on tribal lands. Specifically, FCC’s method of collecting mobile and fixed broadband data from providers (the Form 477) does not accurately or completely capture broadband access on tribal lands because it (1) captures nationwide broadband availability data— areas where providers may have broadband infrastructure—but does so in a way that leads to overstatements of availability, and (2) does not capture information on factors that FCC and tribal stakeholders have stated can affect broadband access on tribal lands, such as affordability, service quality, and denials of service. Nonetheless, FCC uses its Form 477 broadband availability data in annual broadband deployment reports to measure the percentage of Americans living on tribal lands with or without access to broadband, and to measure progress toward FCC’s strategic goal of increasing all Americans’ access to affordable broadband. By using broadband availability data to measure broadband access on tribal lands, FCC overstates broadband access on tribal lands. FCC’s Form 477, its primary method of collecting nationwide broadband data, collects information on broadband availability, which identifies where providers have broadband infrastructure and could potentially provide broadband services but not where consumers can actually access those services. Moreover, the Form 477’s mobile broadband data- collection methods are not standardized, and its fixed broadband data- collection methods are not sufficiently granular to provide information about broadband availability on tribal lands. FCC’s Form 477 requires mobile broadband providers to report their coverage areas by submitting geospatial data depicting the areas in which consumers could expect to receive the minimum advertised speed. FCC has previously noted the importance of collecting nationally standardized, uniform broadband data from providers to assess broadband availability and allow for easy comparison across providers. However, the Form 477 does not require that providers use a standardized method with defined technical parameters (such as signal strength, or amount of interference) when determining their coverage area, resulting in data that cannot be meaningfully compared across providers, according to FCC. To map their coverage areas, providers may use predictive models based on different measurement methods and a variety of factors known to affect mobile broadband service such as topography, tree cover, and buildings, among other factors. Providers and tribal stakeholders have expressed concern with the accuracy of FCC’s mobile broadband data, and FCC has acknowledged concerns that the lack of a standardized method resulted in data that were unreliable for the purposes of determining mobile broadband coverage for specific geographic areas, such as tribal lands. About half of the tribal government representatives we interviewed told us that they believe FCC’s data overstate mobile LTE broadband availability on their lands. For example, a few representatives expressed concerns with the accuracy of the mobile data in areas with varied terrain, such as mountains and valleys. In comments to FCC, broadband providers have also raised concerns regarding the accuracy of the mobile coverage data generated by the Form 477 for the purposes of identifying areas eligible for funding through FCC’s Mobility Fund Phase II program, which provides federal funding to increase mobile broadband services in unserved areas. In 2017, in response to such concerns, FCC reversed its prior decision to use the Form 477 data to identify specific areas eligible for federal funding through the Mobility Fund Phase II program. Instead, FCC undertook a one-time special data collection, for which it required providers to measure their coverage based on a common set of standards, in order to better identify unserved areas that would be presumptively eligible for funding. FCC plans to allow parties, including tribal governments, to challenge the data where they believe the data overstate mobile broadband coverage through August, 2018. Additionally, in an August 2017 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, FCC requested comment on potential changes to modernize its Form 477 data collection, including whether it should require all providers to use a standardized method when submitting mobile coverage data on the form. FCC officials told us that they do not have a timeline for the development of a final rule, and as of August 2018, FCC had not yet issued a final rule on modernizing the Form 477. The Form 477 collects fixed broadband data that are not sufficiently granular to accurately depict broadband availability on tribal lands. Specifically, FCC directs fixed broadband providers to submit a list of census blocks where service is available on the Form 477. FCC defines “available” as whether the provider does—or could, within a typical service interval or without an extraordinary commitment of resources— provide service to at least one end-user premises in a census block. Thus, in its annual reports and maps of fixed broadband service, FCC considers an entire block to be served if a provider reports that it does, or could offer, service to at least one household in the census block. FCC does not define a typical service interval or an extraordinary commitment of resources in its Form 477 instructions. However, FCC officials stated that providers should not report service in areas in which major construction would be required to provide service. A few providers told us that the lack of clear guidance from FCC regarding how to determine where broadband is available has led different providers to interpret the Form 477 directions in different ways, which can affect the accuracy and consistency of reporting from provider to provider. For example, in a filing with FCC, one provider stated that it had misapplied the definition of “available” and, as a result, overstated the availability of its services by almost 3,000 census blocks. As shown in figure 5, FCC’s definition of availability leads to overstatements of fixed broadband availability on tribal lands by: (1) counting an entire census block as served if only one location has broadband, and (2) allowing providers to report availability in blocks where they do not have any infrastructure connecting homes to their networks if the providers determine they could offer service to at least one household. Almost all the providers and private companies, and most of the representatives of tribal governments and organizations we spoke with told us that due to these issues, FCC’s definition of availability results in data that overstate broadband availability. According to FCC officials, FCC requires providers to report fixed broadband availability where they could provide service within a “typical service interval” and without “an extraordinary commitment of resources” in order to: (1) ensure that it captures instances in which a provider has a network nearby but has not installed the last connection to the homes, and (2) identify where service is connected to homes, but homes have not subscribed. FCC officials also told us that FCC measures availability at the census block level because sub-census block data may be costly to collect. In 2013, FCC considered collecting more granular nationwide data on broadband deployment but decided against collecting these data because it determined that the burden would outweigh the benefit. However, FCC, tribal stakeholders, and providers have noted that FCC’s approach leads to overstatements of availability. For example, in its 2017 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on modernizing the Form 477 data collection, FCC acknowledged that by requiring a provider to report where it could provide service, it is impossible to tell whether the provider would be unable or unwilling to take on additional subscribers in a census block it lists as served. According to FCC, this limits the value of the data to inform FCC policies. In addition, several providers and tribal stakeholders we interviewed said that some “digital subscriber line” (DSL) and fixed wireless providers may overstate their service areas on the Form 477 because they may not take into account technological or terrain limitations that would affect their ability to actually provide service. FCC has also recognized that by measuring availability at the census block level, not every person will have access to broadband in a block that the data show as served, and FCC has noted that in rural areas, such as tribal lands, census blocks can be large and providers may only deploy service to a portion of the census block. A few representatives for tribal governments and organizations noted that the use of census blocks may uniquely overstate broadband availability on tribal lands when census blocks contain both tribal and non-tribal areas, because availability in the non-tribal portion of the block can result in the tribal area of the census block also being counted as served. FCC is considering requiring providers to report whether they are willing and able to serve additional customers in a census block and collecting sub-census block data in its 2017 proposed rulemaking on modernizing the Form 477. About one-third of the parties that commented on FCC’s proposals were not in favor of FCC collecting these more granular data on the Form 477, stating that the data would be less accurate and more burdensome for providers to collect and report, among other reasons, and questioned whether more detailed information on nationwide broadband availability is necessary. We heard similar concerns from a few of the providers and trade associations we interviewed. However, about one- third of the parties that commented on FCC’s proposals were in favor of collecting more granular data, stating that such data would be more useful for policymakers and more accurate. Additionally, a few tribally owned and non-tribal providers we interviewed told us that providers already maintain data for business purposes that would allow them to report more granular information on broadband availability. One stakeholder we spoke with pointed out that, as the federal government and states work to ensure the last remaining unserved areas—rural, low- population density areas including tribal lands—have service, sub- census-block-level data are needed to ensure that governments are making wise and accurate investments. FCC does not collect information on several factors that FCC and tribal stakeholders have stated can affect broadband access. FCC and tribal stakeholders have noted that broadband access can be affected by factors such as the affordability and quality of the broadband services being offered, and the extent to which providers deny service to those who request it. By collecting and using data on factors that can affect broadband access, FCC would have more complete information on the extent to which Americans living on tribal lands have access to broadband Internet services. Affordability: FCC has noted that affordability of broadband services can affect broadband access but does not collect information on the cost of broadband service on tribal lands on the Form 477. For example, in the National Broadband Plan, FCC cited affordable access to robust broadband service as a long-term goal, and in its Strategic Plan 2018–2022, FCC acknowledged that affordability is an important factor affecting broadband access and a key driver of the digital divide. Moreover, most of the representatives of tribal governments and organizations we spoke to told us that the affordability of broadband services is an important factor for understanding whether or not people on tribal lands could realistically access broadband services. Tribal government officials from one tribe we spoke with told us that residents on their lands cannot access broadband because it is too costly. For example, a provider that advertises services on the tribe’s land charges $130 per month for broadband services, approximately one-and-a-half times the average rate providers charge for comparable services in urban areas, according to FCC (see fig. 6). In the 2018 Broadband Deployment Report, FCC acknowledged that affordability can influence a consumer’s decision on whether to purchase broadband, but FCC did not consider cost in its assessment of broadband access on tribal lands, stating that pricing does not go to the congressional requirement to assess deployment and availability in conducting its inquiry as required by Congress under section 706 of the Telecommunications Act and also citing a lack of reliable comprehensive data on this issue. In addition, FCC officials we interviewed acknowledged that while broadband service may be technically available, it may be prohibitively expensive for some, which may make availability alone an incomplete indicator of broadband access. Quality of Service: In the Telecommunications Act of 1996 Congress recognized the importance of service quality by defining advanced telecommunications capability as any technology that enables users to originate and receive high-quality voice, data, graphics, and video telecommunications. In keeping with this legislation, FCC has consistently set thresholds for speeds that qualify as broadband services and has stated that “latency” and consistency of service figure prominently into whether a broadband service is able to provide advanced capabilities and thus whether users can access high-quality telecommunications. Likewise, almost all of the representatives for tribal governments or organizations we interviewed told us that quality of service is a key component of access to broadband and that routine outages, slow speeds, and high latency keep people on tribal lands from consistently accessing the Internet. Most tribal stakeholders and a few providers we interviewed told us that factors such as terrain, weather, and type of technology can all affect the quality of service an end user receives and, ultimately, the subscribers’ ability to access the Internet (see fig. 7). For example, some representatives of tribal governments and organizations told us issues like oversubscription— when a provider signs up more customers than its equipment can handle—and outdated or limited infrastructure result in low-quality services that cannot support advanced and, in some cases, basic functions. Though FCC uses the Form 477 to collect some data on advertised speeds from providers, FCC does not collect data on actual speeds, service outages, and latency on the form. In its 2018 Broadband Deployment Report, FCC stated that it did not consider FCC data on actual speed, latency, or consistency of service when evaluating broadband access due to the lack of appropriate data. FCC noted that the lack of Form 477 data on actual speeds in particular constrained evaluation of mobile broadband access. Service Denials: FCC has recognized that information on denials of service is pertinent to understanding actual broadband access but does not collect data on service denials in the Form 477. Specifically, in the National Broadband Plan, FCC recommended that FCC collect data to determine whether broadband service is being denied to potential residential customers based on the income of the residents in a particular geographic area. Some representatives of the tribal governments or organizations told us that that they were aware of a provider denying service to residents of tribal lands, despite the provider reporting broadband availability on at least a portion of those lands, according to our analysis of the Form 477 data. These representatives told us that they believed service was denied because of disputes with the tribal government, low demand for service, or the high costs of extending services to the home on tribal lands. Some representatives of tribal governments or organizations we spoke with also told us that providers may have denied service because their equipment was at capacity and could not accommodate new users (see fig. 8). For example, on three of the tribal lands we visited, we observed fiber optic cable located close to government and residential structures that did not have broadband access via fiber. According to tribal government officials, despite the physical proximity of the fiber optic cable, the tribal government and residents could not access it because the provider was not offering service or was unwilling or unable to build to the structures. A few providers we interviewed stated that they may not provide services to individuals who request them because of high-costs, administrative barriers, or technical limitations. However, FCC does not collect data on service denials on the Form 477. In its Strategic Plan 2018–2022 and the National Broadband Plan, FCC identified increasing all Americans’ access to affordable broadband as a long-term, strategic goal. Congress has similarly directed FCC to develop policies and programs aimed at increasing access to affordable broadband in all regions of the United States, including tribal lands, and required FCC to report annually on its progress. According to the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), as enhanced by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA), agencies should use accurate and reliable data to measure progress toward achieving their goals. Additionally, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that agencies should use quality information— information that is complete, appropriate, and reliable—to inform decision-making processes and evaluate the agency’s performance in achieving goals. According to these standards, agencies should also communicate quality information externally to achieve the agency’s goals. However, FCC has used its Form 477 data, which do not accurately or completely measure broadband access on tribal lands, as its primary source to evaluate progress toward FCC’s strategic goal of increasing broadband access and to develop maps and reports intended to depict broadband access on tribal lands. For example, in its 2018 Broadband Deployment Report, FCC found that 64.6 percent of Americans residing on tribal lands have access to fixed broadband services. By using these data, FCC has overstated the extent to which Americans living on tribal lands can actually access broadband Internet services and FCC’s progress toward increasing broadband access. As a result, the digital divide may appear less significant as a national challenge, and FCC and tribal stakeholders working to target broadband funding to unserved or underserved tribal lands will be limited in their ability to make informed decisions. This increases the risk that residents living on tribal lands will continue to lack broadband access. Some tribal officials stated that inaccurate data have affected their ability to plan their own broadband networks and obtain federal broadband funding, and most of the tribal stakeholders we interviewed identified a pressing need for accurate data on the gaps in broadband access on tribal lands in order to ensure that tribes can qualify for federal funding and to effectively target the areas that need it most. For example, representatives for one tribal government that is providing broadband services said the government will not be able to use a federal grant to build broadband infrastructure in areas of their reservation that lack access, because the Form 477 data overstate actual access on the tribe’s land. As more than three quarters of the tribal governments we spoke to are working to provide broadband services on their lands in some capacity, overstating broadband access on tribal lands could affect the ability of a number of tribes to access federal funding to increase broadband access on their lands. As previously discussed, FCC is considering proposals to modify its Form 477 data collection as part of a 2017 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, but FCC officials told us that the Commission does not have a timeline for issuance of a final rule. While some of FCC’s proposals could help address some of the limitations identified above by, for example, collecting more granular nationwide broadband availability data, FCC has not addressed specifically the collection of more accurate and complete data on broadband access for tribal lands in this proceeding. FCC has identified the need to improve broadband data for tribal lands in particular, and as previously noted, in 2018 Congress directed FCC to develop a report evaluating broadband coverage in certain tribal lands and initiate a proceeding to address the unserved areas identified in the report. FCC officials told us that FCC has not determined how it will address this requirement, but it is currently considering its options, including potentially addressing the requirement as part of its ongoing proposed rulemaking on modernizing the Form 477 data collection. An evaluation of broadband coverage on tribal lands that relies on the current Form 477 data would be subject to the limitations described above, including the overstatement of broadband access on tribal lands. Additionally, FCC has demonstrated that it is possible in some circumstances to collect more granular data when such data collection is targeted to a specific need or area. For example, in 2017 FCC began requiring certain providers that receive funding through the Connect America Fund to report the latitude and longitude of locations where broadband is available, and FCC has noted that these more granular data are extremely useful to the Commission, especially for rural areas where census blocks can be quite large. A few large providers and trade associations similarly stated in public comments on FCC’s proposed rulemaking to modernize the Form 477 process that FCC should target its collection of more granular broadband data to areas where the data are most likely to be overstated—specifically, large, rural census blocks with low population densities, such as those on tribal lands. Additionally, as discussed above, FCC undertook a one-time special data collection for Mobility Fund II to ensure that the mobile broadband data it collected would be reliable for the intended use. By developing and implementing methods for collecting and reporting accurate and complete data on broadband access specific to tribal lands, FCC would be able to better identify tribal areas without access to broadband and to target federal broadband funding to the tribal areas most in need. FCC uses data submitted by broadband providers via the Form 477 process to develop maps and datasets depicting broadband services nationwide, and in specific locations, such as tribal lands, but does not have a formal process to obtain input from tribes on the accuracy of the broadband data. FCC’s 2010 National Broadband Plan noted the need for the federal government to improve the quality of data regarding broadband on tribal lands and recommended that FCC work with tribes to ensure that any information collected is accurate and useful. It also noted that tribal representatives should have the opportunity to review mapping data about tribal lands and offer supplemental data or corrections. Similarly, federal internal control standards note the need for federal agencies to communicate with external entities, such as tribal governments, and to enable these entities to provide quality information to the agency that will help it achieve its objectives. FCC officials told us that they address questions and concerns regarding provider coverage claims submitted to the Office of Native Affairs and Policy, which will work with tribal governments to help them identify inaccurate broadband data for tribal lands, and share tribal questions and concerns with the appropriate FCC bureaus. However, FCC does not have a formal process for tribes (or other governmental entities) to provide input to ensure that the broadband data FCC collects through the 477 process, or the resulting maps that FCC creates to depict broadband on tribal lands, are accurate. Similarly, FCC does not use other methods to verify provider-submitted Form 477 data on tribal lands against other sources of information, such as on-site tests or data collected by other agencies. When discussing the lack of a formal process for tribal representatives or other governmental entities to provide feedback on the accuracy of the 477 broadband data, FCC officials noted that if consumers and local officials have information on individual locations that lack broadband service, such information does not indicate that the entire census block lacks broadband service. Additionally, FCC officials noted that providers attest to the accuracy of the data and that FCC staff validate the data by conducting internal checks to identify possible errors, such as unlikely changes in a providers’ coverage area, and may follow-up with a provider to discuss such changes. However, these checks do not include soliciting input from tribes. About half of the tribal stakeholders we spoke to raised concerns that FCC’s broadband deployment data rely solely on unverified information submitted by providers. Additionally, most tribal stakeholders we interviewed told us that consistent with the recommendations in the National Broadband Plan, FCC should work directly with tribes to obtain information from them to improve the accuracy of its broadband deployment data for tribal lands. These stakeholders identified several ways in which FCC could work with tribes on this issue, including: conducting on-site visits with tribal stakeholders to observe the extent to which broadband infrastructure and services are present; conducting outreach and technical assistance for tribal stakeholders to raise awareness and use of FCC’s broadband data; and providing opportunities for the tribes to collect their own data or submit feedback regarding the accuracy of FCC’s data. FCC’s National Broadband Plan notes the importance of supporting tribal efforts to build technical expertise with respect to broadband issues, and federal internal control standards state that federal agencies should obtain quality information from external entities. Officials we interviewed in FCC’s Office of Native Affairs and Policy told us that they provide some outreach and technical assistance to tribal officials at regional and national workshops, and FCC officials stated that they conducted specific outreach to tribal entities regarding the Mobility Fund Phase II challenge process, while, about half of the tribal representatives we spoke to stated that they were not aware of the Form 477 data or corresponding maps, or raised concerns about a lack of outreach from FCC to inform tribes about the data. Some tribal stakeholders stated that if FCC were to solicit tribal input as part of its verification of the broadband data and maps, technical training and assistance could help tribes use and provide feedback on the data, or improve the collection and submission of their own data. A few of the stakeholders we interviewed noted that tribes can face difficulties when they attempt to challenge FCC’s broadband availability data. For example, in 2013, prior to the auction that distributed Tribal Mobility Fund Phase 1 support, FCC allowed interested parties to challenge FCC’s preliminary determinations regarding which census blocks lacked 3G or better service and would be eligible for support in the auctions. However, all of the tribal entities that challenged the accuracy of FCC’s data were unsuccessful in increasing the number of eligible areas. According to FCC officials, the tribal entities did not provide sufficient or sufficiently verifiable information to support their challenges. A few tribal stakeholders provided varying reasons for this, one of which was the need for more technical expertise to help the tribe meet FCC’s requirements. Because FCC lacks a formal process to obtain tribal input on its broadband data, FCC is missing an important source of information regarding areas in which the data may overstate broadband service on tribal lands. Tribal stakeholders are able to provide a first-hand perspective on the extent to which service is available within their lands and the extent to which factors like affordability, service quality, and service denials affect residents’ ability to access broadband. FCC plans to award nearly $2 billion in support from the Connect America Fund to areas that it has identified as lacking broadband, including tribal lands. Any inaccuracies in its broadband data could affect FCC’s funding decisions and the ability of tribal lands to access broadband in the future. Additionally, in its 2017 report on tribal infrastructure, the National Congress of American Indians stressed the importance of including tribal governments in a leadership role with respect to collecting data on local infrastructure needs. Specifically, it stressed the need for the federal government to invest in tribal data systems and researchers to generate useful, locally specific data that can inform the development and implementation of infrastructure development projects and assess the effectiveness of those projects over time. By establishing a process to obtain input from tribal governments on the accuracy of provider- submitted broadband data that includes outreach and technical assistance, as recommended in the National Broadband Plan, FCC could help tribes develop and share locally specific information on broadband access, which would in turn improve the accuracy of FCC’s broadband data for tribal lands. The success of such an effort may rely on the tribes’ knowledge of, and technical ability to participate in, the process. When discussing the need to improve data regarding broadband on tribal lands, FCC’s 2010 National Broadband Plan recommended that FCC develop a process for tribes to receive information from providers about broadband services on tribal lands. In 2011, FCC required that Eligible Telecommunications Carriers (providers receiving Universal Service Funds from FCC) serving tribal lands meaningfully engage with tribes regarding communications services (including broadband). Specifically, the providers must file an annual report documenting that this engagement included a discussion of, among other things, a needs assessment and deployment planning for communications services, including broadband. FCC’s 2012 guidance on fulfilling the engagement obligations, which FCC officials confirmed is still in effect, noted that the stated goal of the engagement requirement was to benefit tribal government leaders, providers, and consumers by fostering a dialogue between tribal governments and providers that would lead to improved services on tribal lands. The guidance further noted that the tribal engagement process “cannot be viewed as simply another ‘check the box’ requirement by either party,” and states that a provider should “demonstrate repeated good faith efforts to meaningfully engage with the tribal government.” Finally, FCC noted in its 2012 guidance that the guidance would evolve over time based on the feedback of both tribal governments and broadband providers and that FCC would develop further guidance and best practices. This approach is consistent with federal internal control standards, which call for agencies to communicate with, and obtain quality information from, external parties. About half of the tribal stakeholders we interviewed raised concerns about difficulties accessing information from providers regarding broadband deployment on their tribe’s lands, a key part of the provider engagement process, according to FCC’s guidance. For example, a representative from one tribe stated that a provider declined his requests to meet more than once a year to discuss the provider’s deployment of broadband services on the tribe’s land. A representative from another tribal government stated that some providers are very focused and transparent about their broadband plans and work with the tribe, while other providers treat tribal engagement as a “box to check” and send the tribe broadband deployment information that is not useful because it is redacted. Similarly, some tribal stakeholders stated that providers heavily redacted deployment information (which providers may consider proprietary) or required the tribe sign non-disclosure agreements to access deployment data. According to one tribal stakeholder, these non-disclosure agreements could possibly require tribes to waive tribal sovereign immunity in order to view the data. Some of the industry stakeholders we interviewed stated that they attempt to engage with tribes but the level of responsiveness from tribes varies. For example, some stakeholders stated that they send letters and do not hear back from tribes. One stakeholder stated that they make repeated attempts to contact tribes when they do not hear back after their initial contact, while another stated that a provider meets regularly with some tribes. Although FCC stated in its 2012 guidance that it would update the tribal engagement guidance and develop best practices based on feedback from tribal governments and broadband providers, it has taken limited steps to obtain such feedback from providers and tribal governments to determine whether its guidance is enabling meaningful tribal engagement. Additionally, FCC has not updated the guidance or issued best practices. Thus, FCC has limited information regarding whether its tribal engagement requirement is fulfilling its intended purpose. FCC officials we interviewed said that the Office of Native Affairs and Policy (ONAP) provided information and, in some cases, held training sessions about the tribal engagement obligation during workshops with tribal representatives, and encouraged representatives to contact ONAP with any concerns. ONAP officials also noted that they handle complaints from tribes regarding a lack of provider engagement and reach out to providers to address tribal concerns. ONAP officials stated that they have had internal discussions about whether the guidance is clear or needs revision, but this has not gone beyond internal discussions. A few of the tribal stakeholders provided examples of the benefits of providers engaging with tribes to ensure tribal representatives have access to information regarding broadband availability on their lands. For example, one representative stated that this information could help the tribes plan deployments by focusing on areas that they know the provider does not plan to serve. Another representative stated that tribal engagement could help improve the accuracy of FCC’s broadband maps. By obtaining feedback from both tribal stakeholders and providers on the effectiveness of FCC’s tribal engagement guidance to determine whether changes are needed, FCC would be better positioned to ensure that tribal governments and providers are sharing information in a manner that will lead to improved services on tribal lands. FCC has collected data and developed maps and reports depicting broadband on tribal lands and has noted the lower levels of broadband access on tribal lands, in comparison to other areas. However, limitations in FCC’s existing process for collecting and reporting broadband data have led FCC to overstate broadband access on tribal lands. By taking steps to address these limitations and to collect data that more accurately and completely depict broadband access on tribal lands, FCC would have greater assurance that it is making progress on reducing the digital divide on tribal lands and targeting broadband funding to tribal lands most in need. Without taking these steps, FCC increases the risk that residents living on tribal lands will continue to lack broadband access. Compounding the limitations in FCC’s data collection process is FCC’s lack of a formal process to obtain tribal input on the accuracy of provider- submitted broadband data for tribal lands. By developing a process to solicit tribal input and ensuring that tribes know about the process and are equipped with the technical skills and abilities necessary to provide this information, FCC would be better able to ensure the accuracy of its broadband data for tribal lands. Moreover, FCC would be able to obtain firsthand, locally specific information on broadband access that could inform FCC’s policies and funding decisions and help FCC achieve its goal of increasing broadband access for all Americans, including those living on tribal lands. Finally, by obtaining feedback from providers and tribal stakeholders on the effectiveness of FCC’s tribal engagement guidance, FCC would be better positioned to assess whether its guidance is helping providers meet requirements and ultimately whether providers’ engagement is fulling its intended purpose of fostering a dialogue between tribal governments and providers that would lead to improved services on tribal lands. We are making the following three recommendations to the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. The Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission should develop and implement methods—such as a targeted data collection—for collecting and reporting accurate and complete data on broadband access specific to tribal lands. (Recommendation 1) The Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission should develop a formal process to obtain tribal input on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data that includes outreach and technical assistance to help tribes participate in the process. (Recommendation 2) The Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission should obtain feedback from tribal stakeholders and providers on the effectiveness of FCC’s 2012 statement to providers on how to fulfill their tribal engagement requirements to determine whether FCC needs to clarify the agency’s tribal engagement statement. (Recommendation 3) We provided a draft of this report to FCC for review and comment. In written comments provided by FCC (reproduced in appendix III), FCC agreed with our findings and recommendations. In its written comments, FCC described efforts, some of which are already under way, that it felt would address each recommendation and stated its intent to build upon those efforts. For example, FCC explained that it is exploring methods to collect more granular broadband deployment data and noted the need to balance the burden on Form 477 filers. FCC also noted that it is starting work to address a statutorily-required evaluation of broadband coverage on certain tribal lands. We agree that increasing the granularity of deployment data is helpful in addressing data accuracy issues, but we also note that it is important to collect data related to factors that affect broadband access on tribal lands. FCC also described informal efforts to collect tribal feedback on providers’ broadband data and stated it would explore options for a formal process to collect feedback. Regarding our recommendation related to providers’ engagement efforts, FCC outlined its existing methods by which tribal stakeholders can provide feedback on providers’ engagement efforts and agreed that seeking additional feedback from tribal stakeholders and providers would be desirable. We agree that improving feedback in these ways could help FCC determine whether it needs to clarify its tribal engagement statement. FCC also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, and other interested parties.

This report discusses the extent to which: (1) the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) approach to collecting broadband availability data accurately captures the ability of Americans living on tribal lands to access broadband Internet services and (2) FCC obtains tribal input on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data for tribal lands. To address both objectives, we analyzed FCC’s December 2016 fixed and mobile broadband availability data—the most recent data at the time of our review—to identify the speeds, technologies, and availability providers reported for federally recognized tribal lands. Providers currently report this information to FCC by filing a “Form 477,” twice a year. We also used 2010 U.S. Census data to identify census blocks completely or partially on tribal lands. To assess the reliability of FCC’s data and 2010 U.S. Census data, we reviewed a previous GAO reliability assessment, and for FCC’s data we conducted electronic testing and analysis of the data, reviewed FCC guidance and documentation, and interviewed FCC officials. Based on the results of our analysis, we determined the data to be reliable for our purposes, which were: (1) to inform our selection of tribal governments and providers for interviews and visits, as described below, and (2) to develop maps depicting fixed and mobile broadband availability for the nine tribal lands we selected for visits, in order to obtain tribal representatives’ feedback on the data. Specifically, we mapped; fixed broadband data according to speed and technology, and mobile data for long-term evolution (LTE) services by provider for each tribal land. We used those maps during our visits to discuss the accuracy of the data with representatives for each tribal government or tribally owned provider. Though we analyzed all up and download speeds that providers reported in the Form 477, for the purposes of this report we defined “broadband” as fixed Internet service reaching at least 25 megabits per second (Mbps) download and 3 Mbps upload speeds, in accordance with FCC’s advanced telecommunications capability benchmark in its 2018 Broadband Deployment Report. We also report on the availability of mobile broadband, which, for the purposes of this report, does not have a speed threshold and refers to long-term evolution (LTE) services. To address both objectives and obtain tribal government representatives’ feedback on the accuracy of FCC’s broadband data for their lands, we interviewed representatives from 25 tribal governments or tribally owned providers, including visits to 9 tribal lands. We considered a range of factors when we selected tribal governments and tribally owned providers for interviews, including our analysis of Form 477 data, recommendations from tribal, industry, or government stakeholders regarding tribal and non- tribal representatives familiar with broadband data issues, and demographic and geographic characteristics, among others. For example, we considered demographic characteristics such as unemployment rate from the 2011– 2015 American Community Survey data, and geographic characteristics such as rurality from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes data. The tribes included in our review vary with respect to location, level of broadband availability according to FCC, land mass, and population size and density. The results of our interviews are not generalizable to all tribal governments or tribally owned broadband providers. In addition to tribal governments and tribally owned providers, we interviewed six tribal organizations and four stakeholders who work with tribes on broadband issues. For reporting purposes, we developed the following series of indefinite quantifiers to describe the tribal responses from the 35 entities representing tribal stakeholders we interviewed: 3 to 7 is defined as “a few;” 8 to 15 is described as “some;” 16 to 20 is described as “about half;” 21 to 27 is described as “most;” and 28 to 34 is described as “almost all.” A full list of the tribal stakeholders we interviewed can be found in appendix I. Further, to obtain industry perspectives, we reviewed public comments submitted by providers and industry associations in FCC’s ongoing 2017 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Modernizing the Form 477 Data Program. We also interviewed 10 non-tribally owned fixed and mobile broadband providers and three industry associations to understand providers’ views on the Form 477 and how providers interact with tribal governments. When selecting providers for interviews, we included providers that reported serving the lands of tribal governments we interviewed and selected providers that varied in the percentage of tribal lands they reported serving. The providers we interviewed represent large, nationwide carriers as well as small, local carriers, and offer broadband via a variety of technologies, including fiber optics, digital subscriber line (DSL), fixed wireless, and mobile LTE. The results of our interviews with providers are not generalizable to all broadband providers. In addition, to address both objectives, we interviewed representatives from other government entities, as well as private companies that collect and report broadband data. A full list of the industry stakeholders we interviewed can be found in appendix I. To identify the extent to which FCC’s approach to collecting broadband availability data reflects the ability of Americans living on tribal lands to actually access broadband Internet services, we reviewed documentation of the Form 477 process, including submission guidance, and FCC’s proposals and public comments in its 2017 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Modernizing the Form 477 Data Program and Mobility Fund Phase II proceedings. We also interviewed FCC officials, industry stakeholders, and tribally owned broadband providers to understand FCC’s current process for collecting broadband data. To understand the purpose of the Form 477 data collection process and FCC’s strategic goals, we reviewed relevant statutes, and FCC documents, including FCC’s Strategic Plan 2018––2022, the National Broadband Plan, and FCC’s broadband deployment and progress reports. Given the importance placed on broadband access in these documents, we interviewed tribal stakeholders, as described above and reviewed FCC documents to identify factors affecting the ability of Americans living on tribal lands to access broadband Internet services. We also reviewed previous GAO work that identified barriers to broadband access on tribal lands. We compared the Form 477 process to FCC’s strategic goals and to factors affecting broadband access to determine the extent to which the Form 477 was designed to collect information on those factors and to meet FCC’s goals. We further evaluated this information against the Government Performance and Results Act, as enhanced by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 and Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government. We also reviewed documentation for other FCC data collection programs, including the Measuring Broadband America program and the Urban Rate Survey, to determine the extent to which FCC collected data on factors affecting broadband access outside of the Form 477 process. To determine the extent to which FCC obtains tribal input on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data for tribal lands, we interviewed FCC officials and analyzed FCC documents regarding the collection procedures for the Form 477 data and FCC’s policies for working with tribal governments, as well as Connect America Fund documents regarding requirements for providers to share information with tribal governments. We also reviewed documents on past FCC Universal Service Fund processes to challenge broadband data and identified prior instances in which tribal governments or tribally owned providers challenged FCC’s broadband data and the outcomes of those challenges. Additionally, we interviewed tribal stakeholders, as described above, to understand the extent to which: (1) FCC involves tribal governments and other stakeholders in the validation of Form 477 broadband data, (2) tribal governments can access broadband data from FCC or providers, and (3) FCC’s Form 477 data accurately reflected broadband access on their lands. For the nine tribal lands we visited, we asked tribal governments or tribally owned providers to identify where the data do or do not accurately reflect broadband access on maps of FCC’s data. Further, to identify how providers complied with FCC’s tribal engagement requirement and obtain their perspectives, we interviewed providers and industry associations. We compared FCC’s data validation procedures and tribal stakeholders’ feedback on the process to FCC’s policies for working with tribal governments, FCC recommendations from the National Broadband Plan and Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government. We also interviewed and received written comments from officials from other federal agencies that have broadband programs, including USDA Rural Utilities Service, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), and others, in addition to a state agency and three private companies that collect and report broadband data to understand how other entities collect and validate broadband data. We conducted this performance audit from June 2017 to September 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Mark L. Goldstein, (202) 512-2834 or GoldsteinM@gao.gov.

Congress has prioritized identifying and targeting funds to unserved areas. FCC uses data from broadband providers to develop maps and reports depicting broadband availability in the United States, with specific information on tribal lands. GAO was asked to review FCC's efforts to collect broadband data for tribal lands. This report examines the extent to which: (1) FCC's approach to collecting broadband data accurately captures broadband access on tribal lands and (2) FCC obtains tribal input on the data. GAO interviewed stakeholders from 25 tribal governments or tribally owned providers, and visited nine tribal lands. The selected tribes varied geographically and in levels of broadband availability, among other characteristics. GAO also reviewed FCC's rulemakings on broadband data and interviewed other tribal stakeholders, FCC officials, and 13 non-tribal broadband providers selected to include a diversity of technologies. Provider and tribal interviews were based on non-generalizable samples. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) collects data on broadband availability from providers, but these data do not accurately or completely capture broadband access on tribal lands. Specifically, FCC collects data on broadband availability; these data capture where providers may have broadband infrastructure. However, FCC considers broadband to be “available” for an entire census block if the provider could serve at least one location in the census block. This leads to overstatements of service for specific locations like tribal lands (see figure). FCC, tribal stakeholders, and providers have noted that this approach leads to overstatements of broadband availability. Because FCC uses these data to measure broadband access, it also overstates broadband access—the ability to obtain service—on tribal lands. Additionally, FCC does not collect information on several factors—such as affordability, quality, and denials of service—that FCC and tribal stakeholders stated can affect the extent to which Americans living on tribal lands can access broadband services. FCC provides broadband funding for unserved areas based on its broadband data. Overstatements of access limit FCC's and tribal stakeholders' abilities to target broadband funding to such areas. For example, some tribal officials stated that inaccurate data have affected their ability to plan their own broadband networks and obtain funding to address broadband gaps on their lands. By developing and implementing methods for collecting and reporting accurate and complete data on broadband access specific to tribal lands, FCC would be better able to target federal broadband funding to tribal areas that need it the most and to more accurately assess FCC's progress toward its goal of increasing all Americans' access to affordable broadband. FCC does not have a formal process to obtain tribal input on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data. In the National Broadband Plan , FCC highlighted the need for a targeted approach to improve broadband availability data for tribal lands. As outlined in the plan, such an approach would include working with tribes to ensure that information is accurate and useful. About half of the tribal stakeholders GAO interviewed raised concerns that FCC relies solely on data from providers, and most stated FCC should work with tribes to improve the accuracy of FCC's data. Establishing a formal process to obtain input from tribal governments on the accuracy of provider-submitted broadband data could help improve the accuracy of FCC's broadband data for tribal lands. GAO is making three recommendations to FCC, including that it collect and report data that accurately measure tribal broadband access as well as develop a process to obtain tribal input on the accuracy of the data. FCC agreed with the recommendations.""]","8882","gov_report","en","None","ba50360a6669fb0e2fbd41a020483b9bab271b5ce69b5c87","Summary:","gov_report","532","\nThe federal government recognizes 573 Indian tribes as distinct, independent political communities with tribal sovereignty.

The FCC's primary method for collecting broadband data is through the Form 477, which requires providers to report broadband providers to report on their broadband availability. However, the FCC has not developed a formal process to obtain tribal input on the accuracy of the data. The FCC has also not obtained feedback on the effectiveness of the broadband data on tribal lands. The report recommends that the FCC should develop a formal process to obtain tribal input on the accuracy of the data and the effectiveness of the broadband on tribal lands."
"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nWhile no commonly accepted definition of a community bank exists, they are generally smaller banks that provide banking services to the local community and have management and board members who reside in the local community. In some of our past reports, we often defined community banks as those with under $10 billion in total assets. However, many banks have assets well below $10 billion as data from the financial condition reports that institutions submit to regulators (Call Reports) indicated that of the more than 6,100 banks in the United States, about 90 percent had assets below about $1.2 billion as of March 2016. Based on our prior interviews and reviews of documents, regulators and others have observed that small banks tend to differ from larger banks in their relationships with customers. Large banks are more likely to engage in transactional banking, which focuses on the provision of highly standardized products that require little human input to manage and are underwritten using statistical information. Small banks are more likely to engage in what is known as relationship banking in which banks consider not only data models but also information acquired by working with the banking customer over time. Using this banking model, small banks may be able to extend credit to customers such as small business owners who might not receive a loan from a larger bank. Small business lending appears to be an important activity for community banks. As of June 2017, community banks had almost $300 billion outstanding in loans with an original principal balance of under $1 million (which banking regulators define as small business lending), or about 20 percent of these institutions’ total lending. In that same month, non- community banks had about $390 billion outstanding in business loans under $1 million representing 5 percent of their total lending. Credit unions are nonprofit member-owned institutions that take deposits and make loans. Unlike banks, credit unions are subject to limits on their membership because members must have a “common bond”—for example, working for the same employer or living in the same community. Financial reports submitted to NCUA (the regulator that oversees federally-insured credit unions) indicated that of the more than 6,000 credit unions in the United States, 90 percent had assets below about $393 million as of March 2016. In addition to providing consumer products to their members, credit unions are also allowed to make loans for business activities subject to certain restrictions. These member business loans are defined as a loan, line of credit, or letter of credit that a credit union extends to a borrower for a commercial, industrial, agricultural, or professional purpose, subject to certain exclusions. In accordance with rules effective January 2017, the total amount of business lending credit unions can do is not to generally exceed 1.75 times the actual net worth of the credit union. Federal banking and credit union regulators have responsibility for ensuring the safety and soundness of the institutions they oversee, protecting federal deposit insurance funds, promoting stability in financial markets, and enforcing compliance with applicable consumer protection laws. All depository institutions that have federal deposit insurance have a federal prudential regulator. The regulator responsible for overseeing a community bank or credit union varies depending on how the institution is chartered, whether it is federally insured, and whether it is a Federal Reserve member (see table 1). Other federal agencies also impose regulatory requirements on banks and credit unions. These include rules issued by CFPB, which has supervision and enforcement authority for various federal consumer protection laws for depository institutions with more than $10 billion in assets and their affiliates. The Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC, and NCUA continue to supervise for consumer protection compliance at institutions that have $10 billion or less in assets. Although community banks and credit unions with less than $10 billion in assets typically would not be subject to CFPB examinations, they generally are required to comply with CFPB rules related to consumer protection. In addition, FinCEN also issues requirements that financial institutions, including banks and credit unions, must follow. FinCEN is a component of Treasury’s Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence that supports government agencies by collecting, analyzing, and disseminating financial intelligence information to combat money laundering. It is responsible for administering the Bank Secrecy Act, which, with its implementing regulations, generally requires banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions, to collect and retain various records of customer transactions, verify customers’ identities in certain situations, maintain AML programs, and report suspicious and large cash transactions. FinCEN relies on financial regulators and others to examine U.S. financial institutions to determine compliance with these requirements. In addition, financial institutions also have to comply with requirements by Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control to review transactions to ensure that business is not being done with sanctioned countries or individuals. In response to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, Congress passed the Dodd- Frank Act, which became law on July 21, 2010. The act includes numerous reforms to strengthen oversight of financial services firms, including consolidating consumer protection responsibilities within CFPB. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, federal financial regulatory agencies were directed to or granted authority to issue hundreds of regulations to implement the act’s reforms. Many of the provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act target the largest and most complex financial institutions, and regulators have noted that much of the act is not meant to apply to community banks. Although the Dodd-Frank Act exempts small institutions, such as community banks and credit unions, from several of its provisions, and authorizes federal regulators to provide small institutions with relief from certain regulations, it also contains provisions that impose additional restrictions and compliance costs on these institutions. As we reported in 2012, federal regulators, state regulatory associations, and industry associations collectively identified provisions within 7 of the act’s 16 titles that they expected to affect community banks and credit unions. The provisions they identified as likely to affect these institutions included some of the act’s mortgage reforms, such as those requiring institutions to ensure that a consumer obtaining a residential mortgage loan has the reasonable ability to repay the loan at the time the loan is consummated; comply with a new CFPB rule that combines two different mortgage loan disclosures that had been required by the Truth-in-Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974; and ensure that property appraisers are sufficiently independent. In addition to the regulations that have arisen from provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act, we reported that other regulations have created potential burdens for community banks. For example, the depository institution regulators also issued changes to the capital requirements applicable to these institutions. Many of these changes were consistent with the Basel III framework, which is a comprehensive set of reforms to strengthen global capital and liquidity standards issued by an international body consisting of representatives of many nations’ central banks and regulators. These new requirements significantly changed the risk-based capital standards for banks and bank holding companies. As we reported in November 2014, officials interviewed from community banks did not anticipate any difficulties in meeting the U.S. Basel III capital requirements but expected to incur additional compliance costs. In addition to regulatory changes that could increase burden or costs on community banks, some of the Dodd-Frank Act provisions have likely resulted in reduced costs for these institutions. For example, revisions to the way that deposit insurance premiums are calculated reduced the amount paid by banks with less than $10 billion in assets by $342 million or 33 percent from the first to second quarter of 2011 after the change became effective. Another change reduced the audit-related costs that some banks were incurring in complying with provisions of the Sarbanes- Oxley Act. A literature search indicated that prior studies by other entities, including regulators, trade associations or others, which examined how to measure regulatory burden generally focused on direct costs resulting from compliance with regulations, and our analysis of them identified various limitations that restrict their usefulness in assessing regulatory burden. For example, researchers commissioned by the Credit Union National Association, which advocates for credit unions, found costs attributable to regulations totaled a median of 0.54 percent of assets in 2014 for a non- random sample of the 53 small, medium, and large credit unions responding to a nationwide survey. However, one of the study’s limitations was its use of a small, non-random sample of credit unions. In addition, the research was not designed to conclusively link changes in regulatory costs for the sampled credit unions to any one regulation or set of regulations. CFPB also conducted a study of regulatory costs associated with specific regulations applicable to checking accounts, traditional savings accounts, debit cards, and overdraft programs. Through case studies involving 200 interviews with staff at seven commercial banks with assets over $1 billion, the agency’s staff determined that the banks’ costs related to ongoing regulatory compliance were concentrated in operations, information technology, human resources, and compliance and retail functions, with operations and information technology contributing the highest costs. While providing detailed information about the case study institutions, reliance on a small sample of mostly large commercial banks limits the conclusions that can be drawn about banks’ regulatory costs generally. In addition, the study notes several challenges to quantifying compliance costs that made their cost estimates subject to some measurement error, and the study’s design limits the extent to which a causal relationship between financial regulations and costs could be fully established. Researchers from the Mercatus Center at George Mason University used a nongeneralizable survey of banks to find that respondents believed they were spending more money and staff time on compliance than before due to Dodd-Frank regulations. From a universe of banks with less than $10 billion of assets, the center’s researchers used a non-random sample to collect 200 responses to a survey sent to 500 banks with assets less than $10 billion about the burden of complying with regulations arising from the Dodd-Frank Act. The survey sought information on the respondents’ characteristics, products, and services and the effects various regulatory and compliance activities had on operations and decisions, including those related to bank profitability, staffing, and products. About 83 percent of the respondents reported increased compliance costs of greater than or equal to 5 percent due to regulatory requirements stemming from the Dodd-Frank Act. The study’s limitations include use of a non-random sample selection, small response rate, and use of questions that asked about the Dodd-Frank Act in general. In addition, the self-reported survey items used to capture regulatory burden—compliance costs and profitability—have an increased risk of measurement error and the causal relationship between Dodd- Frank Act requirements and changes in these indicators is not well- established. Community bank and credit union representatives that we interviewed identified three sets of regulations as most burdensome to their institutions: (1) data reporting requirements related to loan applicants and loan terms under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 (HMDA); (2) transaction reporting and customer due diligence requirements as part of the Bank Secrecy Act and related anti-money laundering laws and regulations (collectively, BSA/AML); and (3) disclosures of mortgage loan fees and terms to consumers under the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure (TRID) regulations. In focus groups and interviews, many of the institution representatives said these regulations were time- consuming and costly to comply with, in part because the requirements were complex, required preparation of individual reports that had to be reviewed for accuracy, or mandated actions within specific timeframes. However, federal regulators and consumer advocacy groups said that benefits from these regulations were significant. Representatives of community banks and credit unions in all our focus groups and in most of our interviews told us that HMDA’s data collection and reporting requirements were burdensome. Under HMDA and its implementing Regulation C, banks and credit unions with more than $45 million in assets that do not meet regulatory exemptions must collect, record, and report to the appropriate federal regulator, data about applicable mortgage lending activity. For every covered mortgage application, origination, or purchase of a covered loan, lenders must collect information such as the loan’s principal amount, the property location, the income relied on in making the credit decision, and the applicants’ race, ethnicity, and sex. Institutions record this on a form called the loan/application register, compile these data each calendar year, and submit them to CFPB. Institutions have also been required to make these data available to the public upon request, after modifying them to protect the privacy of applicants and borrowers. Representatives of many community banks and credit unions with whom we spoke said that complying with HMDA regulations was time consuming. For example, representatives from one community bank we interviewed said it completed about 1,100 transactions that required HMDA reporting in 2016, and that its staff spent about 16 hours per week complying with Regulation C. In one focus group, participants discussed how HMDA compliance was time consuming because the regulations were complex, which made determining whether a loan was covered and should be reported difficult. As a part of that discussion, one bank representative told us that it was not always clear whether a residence that was used as collateral for a commercial loan was a reportable mortgage under HMDA. In addition, representatives in all of our focus groups in which HMDA was discussed and in some interviews said that they had to provide additional staff training for HMDA compliance. Among the 28 community banks and credit unions whose representatives commented on HMDA in our focus groups, 61 percent noted having to conduct additional HMDA-related training. In most of our focus groups and three of our interviews, representatives of community banks and credit unions also expressed concerns about how federal bank examiners review HMDA data for errors. When regulatory examiners conducting compliance examinations determine that an institution’s HMDA data has errors above prescribed thresholds, the institution has to correct and resubmit its data, further adding to the time required for compliance. While regulators have revised their procedures for assessing errors as discussed later, prior to 2018, if 10 percent or more of the loan/application registers that examiners reviewed had errors, an institution was required to review all of their data, correct any errors, and resubmit them. If 5 percent or more of the reviewed loan/application registers had errors in a single data field, an institution had to review all other registers and correct the data in that field. Participants in one focus group discussed how HMDA’s requirements left them little room for error and that they were concerned that examiners weigh all HMDA fields equally when assessing errors. For example, representatives of one institution noted that for purposes of fair lending enforcement, errors in fields such as race and ethnicity can be more important than errors in the action taken date (the field for the date when a loan was originated or when an application not resulting in an origination was received). Representatives of one institution also noted that they no longer have access to data submission software that allowed them to verify the accuracy of some HMDA data, and this has led to more errors in their submissions. Representatives of another institution told us that they had to have staff conduct multiple checks of HMDA data to ensure the data met accuracy standards, which added to the time needed for compliance. Representatives of many community banks and credit unions with whom we spoke also expressed concerns that compliance requirements for HMDA were increasing. The Dodd-Frank Act included provisions to expand the information institutions must collect and submit under HMDA, and CFPB issued rules implementing these new requirements that mostly became effective January 2018. In addition to certain new data requirements specified in the act, such as age and the total points and fees payable at origination, CFPB’s amendments to the HMDA reporting requirements also added additional data points, including some intended to collect more information about borrowers such as credit scores, as well as more information about the features of loans, such as fees and terms. In the final rule implementing the new requirements, CFPB also expanded the types of loans on which some institutions must report HMDA data to include open-ended lines of credit and reverse mortgages. Participants in two of our focus groups with credit unions said reporting this expanded information will require more staff time and training and cause them to purchase new or upgraded computer software. In most of our focus groups, participants said that changes should be made to reduce the burdens associated with reporting HMDA data. For example, in some focus groups, participants suggested raising the threshold for institutions that have to file HMDA reports above the then current $44 million in assets, which would reduce the number of small banks and credit unions that are required to comply. Representatives of two institutions noted that because small institutions make very few loans compared to large ones, their contribution to the overall HMDA data was of limited value in contrast to the significant costs to the institutions to collect and report the data. Another participant said their institution sometimes make as few as three loans per month. In most of our focus groups, participants also suggested that regulators could collect mortgage data in other ways. For example, one participant discussed how it would be less burdensome for lenders if federal examiners collected data on loan characteristics during compliance examinations. However, staff of federal regulators and consumer groups said that HMDA data are essential for enforcement of fair lending laws and regulations. Representatives of CFPB, FDIC, NCUA, and OCC and groups that advocate for consumer protection issues said that HMDA data has helped address discriminatory practices. For example, some representatives noted a decrease in “redlining” (refusing to make loans to certain neighborhoods or communities). CFPB staff noted that HMDA data provides transparency about lending markets, and that HMDA data from community banks and credit unions is critical for this purpose, especially in some rural parts of the country where they make the majority of mortgage loans. While any individual institution’s HMDA reporting might not make up a large portion of HMDA data for an area, CFPB staff told us that if all smaller institutions were exempted from HMDA requirements, regulators would have little or no data on the types of mortgages or on lending patterns in some areas. Agency officials also told us that few good alternatives to HMDA data exist and that the current collection regime is the most effective available option for collecting the data. NCUA officials noted that collecting mortgage data directly from credit unions during examinations to enforce fair lending rules likely would be more burdensome for the institutions. CFPB staff and consumer advocates we spoke with also said that HMDA provides a low-cost data source for researchers and local policy makers, which leads to other benefits that cannot be directly measured but are included in HMDA’s statutory goals—such as allowing local policymakers to target community investments to areas with housing needs. While representatives of some community banks and credit unions argued that HMDA data were no longer necessary because practices such as redlining have been reduced and they receive few requests for HMDA data from the public, representatives of some consumer advocate groups responded that eliminating the transparency that HMDA data creates could allow discriminatory practices to become more common. CFPB staff and representatives of one of these consumer groups also said that before the financial crisis of 2007–2009, some groups were not being denied credit outright but instead were given mortgages with terms, such as high interest rates, which made them more likely to default. The expanded HMDA data will allow regulators to detect such problematic lending practices for mortgage terms. CFPB and FDIC staff also told us that while lenders will have to collect and report more information, the new fields will add context to lending practices and should reduce the likelihood of incorrectly flagging institutions for potential discrimination. For example, with current data, a lender may appear to be denying mortgage applications to a particular racial or ethnic group, but with expanded data that includes applicant credit scores, regulators may determine that the denials were appropriate based on credit score underwriting. CFPB staff acknowledged that HMDA data collection and reporting may be time consuming, and said they have taken steps to reduce the associated burdens for community banks and credit unions. First, in its final rule implementing the Dodd-Frank Act’s expanded HMDA data requirements, CFPB added exclusions for banks and credit unions that make very few mortgage loans. Effective January 2018, an institution will be subject to HMDA requirements only if it has originated at least 25 closed-end mortgage loans or at least 100 covered open-end lines of credit in each of the 2 preceding calendar years and also has met other applicable requirements. In response to concerns about the burden associated with the new requirement for reporting open-end lines of credit, in 2017. CFPB temporarily increased the threshold for collecting and reporting data for open-end lines of credit from 100 to 500 for the 2018 and 2019 calendar years. CFPB estimated that roughly 25 percent of covered depository institutions will no longer be subject to HMDA as a result of these exclusions. Second, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), which includes CFPB, announced the new FFIEC HMDA Examiner Transaction Testing Guidelines that specify when agency examiners should direct an institution to correct and resubmit its HMDA data due to errors found during supervisory examinations. CFPB said these revisions should greatly reduce the burden associated with resubmissions. Under the revised standards, institutions will no longer be directed to resubmit all their HMDA data if they exceeded the threshold for HMDA files with errors, but will still be directed to correct specific data fields that have errors exceeding the specified threshold. The revised guidelines also include new tolerances for some data fields, such as application date and loan amount. Third, CFPB also introduced a new online system for submitting HMDA data in November 2017. CFPB staff said that the new system, the HMDA Platform, will reduce errors by including features to allow institutions to validate the accuracy and correct the formatting of their data before submitting. They also noted that this platform will reduce burdens associated with the previous system for submitting HMDA data. For example, institutions no longer will have to regularly download software, and multiple users within an institution will be able to access the platform. NCUA officials added that some credit unions had tested the system and reported that it reduced their reporting burden. Finally, on December 21, 2017, CFPB issued a public statement announcing that, for HMDA data collected in 2018, CFPB does not intend to require resubmission of HMDA data unless errors are material, and does not intend to assess penalties for errors in submitted data. CFPB also announced that it intends to open a rule making to reconsider various aspects of the 2015 HMDA rule, such as the thresholds for compliance and data points that are not required by statute. In all our focus groups and many of our interviews, participants said they found BSA/AML requirements to be burdensome due to the staff time and other costs associated with their compliance efforts. To provide regulators and law enforcement with information that can aid in pursuing criminal, tax, and regulatory investigations, BSA/AML statutes and regulations require covered financial institutions to file Currency Transaction Reports (CTR) for cash transactions conducted by a customer for aggregate amounts of more than $10,000 per day and Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR) for activity that might signal criminal activity (such as money laundering or tax evasion); and establish BSA/AML compliance programs that include efforts to identify and verify customers’ identities and monitor transactions to report, for example, transactions that appear to violate federal law. Participants in all of our focus groups discussed how BSA/AML compliance was time-consuming, and in most focus groups participants said this took time away from serving customers. For example, representatives of one institution we interviewed told us that completing a single SAR could take 4 hours, and that they might complete 2 to 5 SARs per month. However, representatives of another institution said that at some times of the year it has filed more than 300 SARs per month. In a few cases, representatives of institutions saw BSA/AML compliance as burdensome because they had to take actions that seemed unnecessary based on the nature of the transactions. For example, one institution’s representatives said that filing a CTR because a high school band deposited more than $10,000 after a fundraising activity seemed unnecessary, while another’s said that it did not see the need to file SARs for charitable organizations that are well known in their community. Representatives of institutions in most of our focus groups also noted that BSA/AML regulations required additional staff training. Some of these representatives noted that the requirements are complex and the activities, such as identifying transactions potentially associated with terrorism, are outside of their frontline staff’s core competencies. Representatives in all focus groups and a majority of interviews said BSA imposes financial costs on community banks and credit unions that must be absorbed by those institutions or passed along to customers. In most of our focus groups, representatives said that they had to purchase or upgrade software systems to comply with BSA/AML requirements, which can be expensive. Some representatives also said they had to hire third parties to comply with BSA/AML regulations. Representatives of some institutions also noted that the compliance requirements do not produce any material benefits for their institutions. In most of our focus groups, participants were particularly concerned that the compliance burden associated with BSA/AML regulations was increasing. In 2016, FinCEN—the bureau in the Department of the Treasury that administers BSA/AML rules—issued a final rule that expanded due-diligence requirements for customer identification. The final rule was intended to strengthen customer identification programs by requiring institutions to obtain information about the identities of the beneficial owners of businesses opening accounts at their institutions. The institutions covered by the rule are expected to be in compliance by May 11, 2018. Some representatives of community banks and credit unions that we spoke with said that this new requirement will be burdensome. For example, one community bank’s representatives said the new due-diligence requirements will require more staff time and training and cause them to purchase new or upgraded computer systems. Representatives of some institutions also noted that accessing beneficial ownership information about companies can be difficult, and that entities that issue business licenses or tax identification numbers could perform this task more easily than financial institutions. In some of our focus groups, and in some comment letters that we reviewed that community banks and credit unions submitted to bank regulators and NCUA as part of the EGRPRA process, representatives of community banks and credit unions said regulators should take steps to reduce the burdens associated with BSA/AML. Participants in two of our focus groups and representatives of two institutions we interviewed said that the $10,000 CTR threshold, which was established in 1972, should be increased, noting it had not been adjusted for inflation. One participant told us that if this threshold had been adjusted for inflation over time, it likely would be filing about half of the number of CTRs that it currently files. In several focus groups, participants also indicated that transactions that must be checked against the Office of Foreign Assets Control list also should be subject to a threshold amount. Representatives of one institution noted that they have to complete time-consuming compliance work for even very small transactions (such as less than $1). Representatives of some institutions suggested that the BSA/AML requirements be streamlined to make it easier for community banks and credit unions to comply. For example, representatives of one institution that participated in the EGRPRA review suggested that institutions could provide regulators with data on all cash transactions in the format in which they keep these records rather than filing CTRs. Finally, participants in one focus group said that regulators should better communicate how the information that institutions submit contributes to law enforcement successes in preventing or prosecuting crimes. Staff from FinCEN told us that the reports and due-diligence programs required in BSA/AML rules are critical to safeguarding the U.S. financial sector from illicit activity, including illegal narcotics and terrorist financing activities. They said they rely on CTRs and SARs that financial institutions file for the financial intelligence they disseminate to law enforcement agencies, and noted that they saw all BSA/AML requirements as essential because activities are designed to complement each other. Officials also pointed out that entities conducting terrorism, human trafficking, or fraud all rely heavily on cash, and reporting frequently made deposits makes tracking criminals easier. They said that significant reductions in BSA/AML reporting requirements would hinder law enforcement, especially because depositing cash through ATMs has become very easy. FinCEN staff said they utilize a continuous evaluation process to look for ways to reduce burden associated with BSA/AML requirements, and noted actions taken as a result. They said that FinCEN has several means of soliciting feedback about potential burdens, including through its Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group that consists of industry, regulatory, and law enforcement representatives who meet twice a year, and also through public reporting and comments received through FinCEN’s regulatory process. FinCEN officials said that based on this advisory group’s recommendations, the agency provided SAR filing relief by reducing the frequency of submission for written SAR summaries on ongoing activity from 90 days to 120 days. FinCEN also has recognized that financial institutions do not generally see the beneficial impacts of their BSA/AML efforts, and officials said they have begun several different feedback programs to address this issue. FinCEN staff said they have been discussing ways to improve the CTR filing process, but in response to comments obtained as part of a recent review of regulatory burden they noted that the staff of law enforcement agencies do not support changing the $10,000 threshold for CTR reporting. FinCEN officials said that they have taken some steps to reduce the burden related to CTR reporting, such as by expanding the ability of institutions to seek CTR filing exemptions, especially for low-risk customers. FinCEN is also utilizing its advisory group to examine aspects of the CTR reporting obligations to assess ways to reduce reporting burden, but officials said it is too early to know the outcomes of the effort. However, FinCEN officials said that while evaluation of certain reporting thresholds may be appropriate, any changes to them or other CTR requirements to reduce burden on financial institutions, must still meet the needs of regulators and law enforcement, and prevent misuse of the financial system. FinCEN staff also said that some of the concerns raised about the upcoming requirements on beneficial ownership may be based on misunderstandings of the rule. FinCEN officials told us that under the final rule, financial institutions can rely on the beneficial ownership information provided to them by the entity seeking to open the account. Under the final rule, the party opening an account on behalf of the legal entity customer is responsible for providing beneficial ownership information, and the financial institution may rely on the representations of the customer unless it has information that calls into question the accuracy of those representations. The financial institution does not have to confirm ownership; rather, it has to verify the identity of the beneficial owners as reported by the individual seeking to open the account, which can be done with photocopies of identifying documents such as a driver’s license. FinCEN issued guidance explaining this aspect of the final rule in 2016. In all of our focus groups and many of our interviews, representatives of community banks and credit unions said that new requirements mandating consolidated disclosures to consumers for mortgage terms and fees have increased the time their staff spend on compliance, increased the cost of providing mortgage lending services, and delayed the completion of mortgages for customers. The Dodd Frank Act directed CFPB to issue new requirements to integrate mortgage loan disclosures that previously had been separately required by the Truth-in-Lending Act (TILA) and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), and their implementing regulations, Regulation Z and X, respectively. Effective in October 2015, the combined TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure (known as TRID) requires mortgage lenders to disclose certain mortgage terms, conditions, and fees to loan applicants during the origination process for certain mortgage loans and prescribe how the disclosures should be made. The disclosure provisions also require lenders, in the absence of specified exceptions, to reimburse or refund to borrowers portions of certain fees that exceed the estimates previously provided in order to comply with the revised regulations. Under TRID, lenders generally must provide residential mortgage loan applicants with two forms, and deliver these documents within specified time frames (as shown in fig. 1). Within 3 business days of an application and at least 7 business days before a loan is consummated, lenders must provide the applicant with the loan estimate, which includes estimates for all financing costs and fees and other terms and conditions associated with the potential loan. If circumstances change after the loan estimate has been provided (for example, if a borrower needs to change the loan amount), a new loan estimate may be required. At least 3 days before a loan is consummated, lenders must provide the applicant with the closing disclosure, which has the loan’s actual terms, conditions, and associated fees. If the closing disclosure is mailed to an applicant, lenders must wait an additional 3 days for the applicant to receive it before they can execute the loan, unless they can demonstrate that the applicant has received the closing disclosure. If the annual percentage rate or the type of loan change after the closing disclosure is provided, or if a prepayment penalty is added, a new closing disclosure must be provided and a new 3-day waiting period is required. Other changes made to the closing disclosure require the provision of a revised closing disclosure, but a new 3-day waiting period is not required. If the fees in the closing disclosure are more than the fees in the loan estimate (subject to some exceptions and tolerances discussed later in this section), the lender must reimburse the applicant for the amount of the increase in order to comply with the applicable regulations. In all of our focus groups and most of our interviews, representatives of community banks and credit unions said that TRID has increased the time required to comply with mortgage disclosure requirements and increased the cost of mortgage lending. In half of our focus groups, participants discussed how they have had to spend additional time ensuring the accuracy of their initial estimates of mortgage costs, including fees charged by third parties, in part because they are now financially responsible for changes in fees during the closing process. Some participants also discussed how they have had to hire additional staff to meet TRID’s requirements. In one focus group of community banks, participants described how mortgage loans frequently involve the use of multiple third parties, such as appraisers and inspectors, and obtaining accurate estimates of the amounts these parties will charge for their services within the 3-day period prescribed by TRID can be difficult. The community banks we spoke with also discussed how fees from these parties often change at closing, and ensuring an accurate estimate at the beginning of the process was not always possible. As a result, some representatives said that community banks and credit unions have had to pay to cure or correct the difference in changed third-party fees that are outside their control. In most of our focus groups and some of our interviews, representatives told us that this TRID requirement has made originating a mortgage more costly for community banks and credit unions. Community banks and credit unions in half of our focus groups and some of our interviews also told us that TRID’s requirements are complex and difficult to understand, which adds to their compliance burden. Participants in one focus group noted that CFPB’s final rule implementing TRID was very long—the rule available on CFPB’s website is more than 1,800 pages including the rule’s preamble—and has many scenarios that require different actions by mortgage lenders or trigger different responsibilities as the following examples illustrate. Some fees in the loan estimate, such as prepaid interest, may be subsequently changed provided that the estimates were in good faith. Other fees, such as for third-party services where the charge is not paid to the lender or the lender’s affiliate, may be changed by as much as 10 percent in aggregate before the lender becomes liable for the difference. However, for some charges the lender must reimburse or refund to the borrower portions of subsequent increases, such as fees paid to the creditor, mortgage broker, or a lender affiliate, without any percentage tolerance. Based on a poll we conducted in all six focus groups, 40 of 43 participants said that they had to provide additional training to staff to ensure that TRID’s requirements were understood, which takes additional time from serving customers. In all of our focus groups and most of our interviews, community banks and credit unions also said that TRID’s mandatory waiting periods and disclosure schedules increased the time required to close mortgage loans, which created burdens for the institutions and their customers. Several representatives we interviewed told us that TRID’s waiting periods led to delays in closings of about 15 days. The regulation mandates that mortgage loans generally cannot be consummated sooner than 7 business days after the loan estimate is provided to an applicant, and no sooner than 3 business days after the closing disclosure is received by the applicant. If the closing disclosure is mailed, the lender must add another 3 business days to the closing period to allow for delivery. Representatives in some of our focus groups said that when changes needed to be made to a loan during the closing period, TRID requires them to restart the waiting periods, which can increase delays. For example, if the closing disclosure had been provided, and the loan product needed to be changed, a new closing disclosure would have to be provided and the applicant given at least 3 days to review it. Some representatives we interviewed said that their customers are frustrated by these delays and would like to close their mortgages sooner than TRID allows. Others said that TRID’s waiting periods decreased flexibility in scheduling the closing date, which caused problems for homebuyers and sellers (for instance, because transactions frequently have to occur on the same day). However, CFPB officials and staff of a consumer group said that TRID has streamlined previous disclosure requirements and is important for ensuring that consumers obtaining mortgages are protected. CFPB reported that for more than 30 years lenders have been required by law to provide mortgage disclosures to borrowers, and CFPB staff noted that prior time frames were similar to those required by TRID and Regulation Z. CFPB also noted that information on the disclosure forms that TRID replaced was sometimes overlapping, used inconsistent terminology, and could confuse consumers. In addition, CFPB staff and staff of a consumer group said that the previous disclosures allowed some mortgage-related fees to be combined, which prevented borrowers from knowing what charges for specific services were. They said that TRID disclosures better highlight important items for home buyers, allowing them to more readily compare loan options. Furthermore, CFPB staff told us that before TRID, lenders and other parties commonly increased a mortgage loan’s fees during the closing process, and then gave borrowers a “take it or leave it” choice just before closing. As a result, borrowers often just accepted the increased costs. CFPB representatives said that TRID protects consumers from this practice by shifting the responsibility for most fee increases to lenders, and increases transparency in the lending process. CFPB staff told us that it is too early to definitively identify what impact TRID has had on borrowers’ understanding of mortgage terms, but told us that some information they have seen indicated that it has been helpful. For example, CFPB staff said that preliminary results from the National Survey of Mortgage Originations conducted in 2017 found that consumer confidence in mortgage lending increased. While CFPB staff said that this may indicate that TRID, which became effective in October 2015, has helped consumers better understand mortgage terms, they noted that the complete survey results are not expected to be released until 2018. CFPB staff said that these results should provide valuable information on how well consumers generally understood mortgage terms and whether borrowers were comparison shopping for loans that could be used to analyze TRID’s effects on consumer understanding of mortgage products. CFPB staff also told us that complying with TRID should not result in significant time being added to the mortgage closing process. Based on the final rule, they noted that TRID’s waiting periods should not lead to delays of more than 3 days. CFPB staff also pointed out that the overall 7-day waiting period and the 3-day waiting period can be modified or waived if the consumer has a bona fide personal financial emergency, and thus should not be creating delays for those consumers. To waive the waiting period, consumers have to provide the lender with a written statement that describes the emergency. CFPB staff also said that closing times are affected by a variety of factors and can vary substantially, and that the delays that community banks and credit unions we spoke with reported may not be representative of the experiences of other lenders. A preliminary CFPB analysis of industry-published mortgage closing data found that closing times increased after it first implemented TRID, but that the delays subsequently declined. CFPB staff also said that they plan to analyze closing times using HMDA data now that they are collecting these data, and that they expect that delays that community banks and credit unions may have experienced so far would decrease as institutions adjusted to the new requirements. Based on our review of TRID’s requirements and discussions with community banks and credit unions, some of the burden related to TRID that community banks and credit unions described appeared to result from institutions taking actions not required by regulations, and community banks and credit unions told us they still were confused about TRID requirements. For example, representatives of some institutions we interviewed said that they believed TRID requires the entire closing disclosure process to be restarted any time any changes were made to a loan’s amount. CFPB staff told us that this is not the case, and that revised loan estimates can be made in such cases without additional waiting periods. Representatives of several other community banks and credit unions cited 5- and 10-day waiting periods not in TRID requirements, or believed that the 7-day waiting period begins after the closing disclosure is received by the applicant, rather than when the loan estimate is provided. Participants in one focus group discussed that they were confused about when to provide disclosures and what needs to be provided. Representatives of one credit union said that if they did not understand a requirement, it was in their best interest to delay closing to ensure they were in compliance. CFPB staff said that they have taken several steps to help lenders understand TRID requirements. CFPB has published a Small Entity Compliance Guide and a Guide to the Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure Forms. As of December 2017, these guides were accessible on a TRID implementation website that has links to other information about the rule, as well as blank forms and completed samples. CFPB staff told us that the bureau conducted several well-attended, in-depth webinars to explain different aspects of TRID, including one with more than 20,000 participants, and that recordings of the presentations remained available on the bureau’s TRID website. CFPB also encourages institutions to submit questions about TRID through the website, and the staff said that they review submitted questions for any patterns that may indicate that an aspect of the regulation is overly burdensome. However, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that CFPB’s guidance for TRID had not met the needs of mortgage lenders. In a 2017 report on reforming CFPB, this association stated that timely and accessible answers to frequently asked questions about TRID were still needed, noting that while CFPB had assigned staff to answer questions, these answers were not widely circulated. The association also reported that it had made repeated requests for additional guidance related to TRID, but the agency largely did not respond with additional materials in response to these requests. Although we found that misunderstandings of TRID requirements could be creating unnecessary compliance burdens for some small institutions, CFPB had not assessed the effectiveness of the guidance it provided to community banks and credit unions. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, CFPB has a general responsibility to ensure its regulations are not unduly burdensome, and internal control standards direct federal agencies to analyze and respond to risks related to achieving their defined objectives. However, CFPB staff said that they have not directly assessed how well community banks and credit unions have understood TRID requirements and acknowledged that some of these institutions may be applying the regulations improperly. They said that CFPB intends to review the effectiveness of its guidance, but did not indicate when this review would be completed. Until the agency assesses how well community banks and credit unions understand TRID requirements, CFPB may not be able to effectively respond to the risk that some smaller institutions have implemented TRID incorrectly, unnecessarily burdening their staff and delaying consumers’ home purchases. We did not find that regulators directed institutions to comply with regulations from which they were exempt, although institutions were concerned about the appropriateness of examiner expectations. To provide regulatory relief to community banks and credit unions, Congress and regulators have sometimes exempted smaller institutions from the need to comply with all or part of some regulations. Such exemptions are often based on the size of the financial institution or the level of particular activities. For example, CFPB exempted institutions with less than $45 million in assets and fewer than 25 closed-end mortgage loans or 500 open-end lines of credit from the expanded HMDA reporting requirements. In January 2013, CFPB also included exemptions for some institutions in a rule related to originating loans that meet certain characteristics—known as qualified mortgages—in order for the institutions to receive certain liability protections if the loans later go into default. To qualify for this treatment, the lenders must make a good faith effort to determine a borrower’s ability to repay a loan and the loan must not include certain risky features (such as interest-only or balloon payments). In its final rule, CFPB included exemptions that allow small creditors to originate loans with certain otherwise restricted features (such as balloon payments) and still be considered qualified mortgage loans. Concerns expressed to legislators about exemptions not being applied appeared to be based on misunderstandings of certain regulations. For example, in June 2016, a bank official testified that he thought his bank would be exempt from all of CFPB’s requirements. However, CFPB’s rules applicable to banks apply generally to all depository institutions, although CFPB only conducts compliance examinations for institutions with assets exceeding $10 billion. The depository institution regulators continue to examine institutions with assets below this amount (the overwhelming majority of banks and credit unions) for compliance with regulations enacted by CFPB. Although not generalizable, our analysis of select examinations did not find that regulators directed institutions to comply with requirements from which they were exempt. In our interviews with representatives from 17 community banks and credit unions, none of the institutions’ representatives identified any cases in which regulators required their institution to comply with a regulatory requirement from which they should have been exempt. We also randomly selected and reviewed examination reports and supporting material for 28 examinations conducted by the regulators to identify any instances in which the regulators had not applied exemptions. From our review of the 28 examinations, we found no instances in the examination reports or the scoping memorandums indicating that examiners had required these institutions to comply with the regulations covered by the eight selected exemptions. Because of the limited number of the examinations we reviewed, we cannot generalize our findings to the regulatory treatment of all institutions qualifying for exemptions. Although not identifying issues relating to exemptions, representatives of community banks and credit unions in about half of our interviews and focus groups expressed concerns that their regulators expected them to follow practices they did not feel corresponded to the size or risks posed by their institutions. For example, representatives from one institution we interviewed said that examiners directed them to increase BSA/AML activities or staff, whereas they did not see such expectations as appropriate for institutions of their size. Similarly, in public forums held by regulators as part of their EGRPRA reviews (discussed in the next section) a few bank representatives stated that regulators sometimes considered compliance activities by large banks to be best practices, and then expected smaller banks to follow such practices. However, institution representatives in the public forums and in our interviews and focus groups that said sometimes regulators’ expectations for their institutions were not appropriate, but did not identify specific regulations or practices they had been asked to consider following when citing these concerns. To help ensure that applicable exemptions and regulatory expectations are appropriately applied, federal depository institution regulators told us they train their staff in applicable requirements and conduct senior-level reviews of examinations to help ensure that examiners only apply appropriate requirements and expectations on banks and credit unions. Regulators said that they do not conduct examinations in a one-size-fits- all manner, and aim to ensure that community banks and credit unions are held to standards appropriate to their size and business model. To achieve this, they said that examiners undergo rigorous training. For example, FDIC staff said that its examiners have to complete four core trainings and then receive ongoing on-the-job instruction. Each of the four regulators also said they have established quality assurance programs to review and assess their examination programs periodically. For example, each Federal Reserve Bank reviews its programs for examination inconsistency and the Federal Reserve Board staff conducts continuous and point-in-time oversight reviews of Reserve Banks’ examination programs to identify issues or problems, such as examination inconsistency. The depository institution regulators also said that they have processes for depository institutions to appeal examination findings if they feel they were held to inappropriate standards. In addition to less formal steps, such as contacting a regional office, each of the four regulators have an ombudsman office to which institutions can submit complaints or concerns about examination findings. Staffs of the various offices are independent from the regulators’ management and work with the depository institutions to resolve examination issues and concerns. If the ombudsman is unable to resolve the complaints, then the institutions can further appeal their complaints through established processes. Federal depository institution regulators address regulatory burden of their regulated institutions through the rulemaking process and also through retrospective reviews that may provide some regulatory relief to community banks. However, the retrospective review process has some limitations that limit its effectiveness in assessing and addressing regulatory burden on community banks and credit unions. Federal depository institution regulators can address the regulatory burden of their regulated institutions throughout the rulemaking process and through mandated, retrospective or “look back” reviews. According to the regulators, attempts to reduce regulatory burden start during the initial rulemaking process. Staff from FDIC, Federal Reserve, NCUA, and OCC all noted that when promulgating rules, their staff seek input from institutions and others throughout the process to design requirements that achieve the goals of the regulation at the most reasonable cost and effort for regulated entities. Once a rule has been drafted, the regulators publish it in the Federal Register for public comment. The staff noted that regulators often make revisions in response to the comments received to try to reduce compliance burdens in the final regulation. After regulations are implemented, banking regulators also address regulatory burdens by periodically conducting mandated reviews of their regulations. The Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 (EGRPRA) directs three regulators (Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC, as agencies represented on the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council) to review at least every 10 years all of their regulations and through public comment identify areas of the regulations that are outdated, unnecessary or unduly burdensome on insured depository institutions. Under the act, the regulators are to categorize their regulations and provide notice and solicit public comment on all the regulations for which they have regulatory authority. The act also includes a number of requirements on how the regulators should conduct the review, including reporting results to Congress. The first EGRPRA review was completed in 2007. The second EGRPRA review began in 2014 and the report summarizing its results was submitted to Congress in March 2017. While NCUA is not required to participate in the EGRPRA review (because EGRPRA did not include the agency in the list of agencies that must conduct the reviews), NCUA has been participating voluntarily. NCUA’s assessment of its regulations appears in separate sections of the reports provided to Congress for each of the 2007 and 2017 reviews. Regulators began the most recent EGRPRA review by providing notice and soliciting comments in 2014–2016. The Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC issued four public notices in the Federal Register seeking comments from regulated institutions and interested parties on 12 categories of regulations they promulgated. The regulators published a list of all the regulations they administer in the notices and asked for comments, including comments on the extent to which regulations were burdensome. Although not specifically required under EGRPRA, the regulators also held six public meetings across the country with several panels of banks and community groups. At each public meeting, at least three panels of bank officials represented banks with assets of generally less than $5 billion and a large number of the panels included banks with less than $2 billion in assets. Panels were dedicated to specific regulations or sets of regulations. For example, one panel covered capital-related rules, consumer protection, and director-related rules, and another addressed BSA/AML requirements. Although panels were dedicated to specific regulations or sets of regulations, the regulators invited comment on all of their regulations at all public meetings. The regulators then assessed the public comments they received and described actions they intended to take in response. EGRPRA requires that the regulators identify the significant issues raised by the comments. The regulators generally deemed the issues that received the most public comments as significant. For the 2017 report, representatives at the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC reviewed, evaluated, and summarized more than 200 comment letters and numerous oral comments they received. For interagency regulations that received numerous comments, such as those relating to capital and BSA/AML requirements, the comment letters for each were provided to staff of one of the three regulators or to previously established interagency working groups to conduct the initial assessments. The regulators’ comment assessments also included reviews by each agency’s subject-matter experts, who prepared draft summaries of the concerns and proposed agency responses for each of the rules that received comments. According to one bank regulator, the subject-matter experts assessed the comments across three aspects: (1) whether a suggested change to the regulation would reduce bank burdens; (2) how the change to the regulation would affect the safety and soundness of the banking system; and (3) whether a statutory change would be required to address the comment. The summaries drafted by the subject-matter experts then were shared with staff representing all three regulators and further revised. The staff of the three regulators said they then met jointly to analyze the merits of the comments and finalize the comment responses and the proposed actions for approval by senior management at all three regulators. In the 2017 report summarizing their assessment of the comments received, the regulators identified six significant areas in which commenters raised concerns: (1) capital rules, (2) financial condition reporting (Call Reports), (3) appraisal requirements, (4) examination frequency, (5) Community Reinvestment Act, and (6) BSA/AML. Based on our analysis of the 2017 report, the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC had taken or pledged to take actions to address 11 of the 28 specific concerns commenters had raised across these six areas. We focused our analysis on issues within the six significant issues that affected the smaller institution and defined an action taken by the regulators as a change or revision to a regulation or the issuance of guidance. Capital rules. The regulators noted in the 2017 EGRPRA report that they received comment letters from more than 30 commenters on the recently revised capital requirements. Although some of the concerns commenters expressed related to issues affecting large institutions, some commenters sought to have regulators completely exempt smaller institutions from the requirements. Others objected to the amounts of capital that had to be held for loans made involving more volatile commercial real estate. In response, the regulators stated that the more than 500 failures of banks in the recent crisis, most of which were community banks, justified requiring all banks to meet the new capital requirements. However, they pledged in the report to make some changes, and have recently proposed rules that would alter some of the requirements. For example, on September 27, 2017, the regulators proposed several revisions to the capital requirements that would apply to banks not subject to the advanced approach requirements under the capital rules (generally, banks with less than $250 billion in assets and less than $10 billion in total foreign exposure). For example, the proposed rule simplifies the capital treatment for certain commercial acquisition, development, and construction loans, and would change the treatment of mortgage servicing assets. Call Reports. The regulators also received more than 30 comments relating to the reports—known as Call Reports—that banks file with the regulators outlining their financial condition and performance. Generally, the commenters requested relief (reducing the number of items required to be reported) for smaller banks and also asked that the frequency of reporting for some items be reduced. In response to these concerns, the regulators described a review of the Call Report requirements intended to reduce the number of items to be reported to the regulators. The regulators had started this effort to address Call Report issues soon after the most recent EGRPRA process had begun in June 2014. In the 2017 EGRPRA report, the regulators noted that they developed a new Call Report form for banks with assets of less than $1 billion and domestic offices only. For instance, according to the regulators, the new form reduced the number of items such banks had to report by 40 percent. Staff from the regulators told us that about 3,500 banks used the new small-bank reporting form in March 2017, which represented about 68 percent of the banks eligible to use the new form. OCC officials told us that an additional 100 federally chartered banks submitted the form for the 2017 second quarter reporting period. After the issuance of the 2017 EGRPRA report, in June 2017 the regulators issued additional proposed revisions to the three Call Report forms that banks are required to complete. These proposed changes are to become effective in June 2018. For example, one of the proposed changes to the new community bank Call Report form would change the frequency of reporting certain data on non-accrual assets— nonperforming loans that are not generating their stated interest rate— from quarterly to semi-annually. In November 2017, the agencies issued further proposed revision to the community bank Call Report that would delete or consolidate a number of items and add a new, or raise certain existing, reporting thresholds. The proposed revision would take effect as of June 2018. Appraisals. The three bank regulators and NCUA received more than 160 comments during the 2017 EGRPRA process related to appraisal requirements. The commenters included banks and others that sought to raise the size of the loans that require appraisals, and a large number of appraisers that objected to any changes in the requirements According to the EGRPRA report, several professional appraiser associations argued that raising the threshold could undermine the safety and soundness of lenders and diminish consumer protection for mortgage financing. These commenters argued that increasing the thresholds could encourage banks to neglect collateral risk-management responsibilities. In response, in July 2017, the regulators proposed raising the threshold for when an appraisal is required from $250,000 to $400,000 for commercial real estate loans. The regulators indicated that the appraisal requirements for 1-4 family residential mortgage loans above the current $250,000 would not be appropriate at the this time because they believed having such appraisals for loans above that level increased the safety of those loans and better protected consumers and because other participants in the housing market, such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the government-sponsored enterprises, also required appraisals for loans above that amount. However, the depository institution regulators included in the proposal a request for comment about the appraisal requirements for residential real estate and what banks think are other factors that should be included when considering the threshold for these loans. As part of the 2017 EGRPRA process, the regulators also received comments indicating that banks in rural areas were having difficulty securing appraisers. In the EGRPRA report, the regulators acknowledged this difficulty and in May 2017, the bank regulators and NCUA issued agency guidance on how institutions could obtain temporary waivers and use other means to expand the pool of persons eligible to prepare appraisals in cases in which suitable appraiser staff were unavailable. The agencies also responded to commenters who found the evaluation process confusing by issuing an interagency advisory on the process in March 2016. Evaluations may be used instead of an appraisal for certain transactions including those under the threshold. Frequency of safety and soundness examinations. As part of the 2017 EGRPRA process, the agencies also received comments requesting that they raise the total asset threshold for an insured depository institution to qualify for the extended 18-month examination cycle from $1 billion to $2 billion and to further extend the examinations cycle from 18 months to 36 months. During the EGRPRA process, Congress took legislative action to reduce examination frequency for smaller, well-capitalized banks. In 2015, the FAST Act raised the threshold for the 18-month examination cycle from less than $500 million to less than $1 billion for certain well-capitalized and well-managed depository institutions with an “outstanding” composite rating and gave the agencies discretion to similarly raise this threshold for certain depository institutions with an “outstanding” or “good” composite rating. The agencies exercised this discretion and issued a final rule in 2016 making qualifying depository institutions with less than $1 billion in total assets eligible for an 18-month (rather than a 12-month) examination cycle. According to the EGRPRA report, agency staff estimated that the final rules allowed approximately 600 more institutions to qualify for an extended 18-month examination cycle, bringing the total number of qualifying institutions to 4,793. Community Reinvestment Act. The commenters in the 2017 EGRPRA process also raised various issues relating to the Community Reinvestment Act, including the geographic areas in which institutions were expected to provide loans to low- and moderate-income borrowers and whether credit unions should be required to comply with the act’s requirements. The regulators noted that they were not intending to take any actions to revise regulations relating to this act because many of the revisions the commenters suggested would require changes to the statute (that is, legislative action). The regulators also noted that they had addressed some of the concerns by revising the Interagency Questions and Answers relating to this act in 2016. Furthermore, the agencies noted that they have been reviewing their existing examination procedures and practices to identify policy and process improvements. BSA/AML. The regulators also received a number of comments as part of the 2017 EGRPRA process on the burden institutions encounter in complying with BSA/AML requirements. These included the threshold for reporting currency transactions and suspicious activities. The regulators also received comments on both BSA/AML examination frequency and the frequency of safety and soundness examinations generally. Agencies typically review BSA/AML compliance programs during safety and soundness examinations. As discussed previously, regulators allowed more institutions of outstanding or good composite condition to be examined every 18 months instead of every 12 months. Institutions that qualify for less frequent safety-and-soundness examinations also will be eligible for less frequent BSA/AML examinations. For the remainder of the issues raised by commenters, the regulators noted they do not have the regulatory authority to revise the requirements but provided the comments to FinCEN, which has authority for these regulations. A letter with FinCEN’s response to the comments was included as an appendix of the EGRPRA report. In the letter, the FinCEN Acting Director stated that FinCEN would work through the issues raised by the comments with its advisory group consisting of regulators, law enforcement staff, and representatives of financial institutions. Additional Burden Reduction Actions. In addition to describing some changes in response to the comments deemed significant, the regulators’ 2017 report also includes descriptions of additional actions the individual agencies have taken or planned to take to reduce the regulatory burden for banks, including community banks. The Federal Reserve Board noted that it changed its Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement that allows small bank holding companies to hold more debt than permitted for larger bank holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve noted that it had made changes to certain supervisory policies, such as issuing guidance on assessing risk management for banks with less than $50 billion in assets and launching an electronic application filing system for banks and bank holding companies. OCC noted that it had issued two final rules amending its regulations for licensing/chartering and securities-related filings, among other things. According to OCC staff, the agency conducted an internal review of its agency-specific regulations and many of the changes to these regulations came from the internal review. The agency also noted that it integrated its rules for national banks and federal savings associations where possible. In addition, OCC noted that it removed redundant and unnecessary information requests from those made to banks before examinations. FDIC noted that it had rescinded enhanced supervisory procedures for newly insured banks and reduced the consumer examination frequency for small and newly insured banks. Similarly to OCC, FDIC is integrating its rules for both non-state member banks and state- chartered savings and loans associations. In addition, FDIC noted it had issued new guidance on banks’ deposit insurance filings and reduced paperwork for new bank applications. The 2017 report also presents the results of NCUA’s concurrent efforts to obtain and respond to comments as part of the EGRPRA process. NCUA conducts its review separately from the bank regulators’ review. In four Federal Register notices in 2015, NCUA sought comments on 76 regulations that it administers. NCUA received about 25 comments raising concerns about 29 of its regulations, most of which were submitted by credit union associations. NCUA received no comments on 47 regulations. NCUA’s methodology for its regulatory review was similar to the bank regulators’ methodology. According to NCUA, all comment letters responding to a particular notice were collected and reviewed by NCUA’s Special Counsel to the General Counsel, an experienced, senior-level attorney with overall responsibility for EGRPRA compliance. NCUA staff told us that criteria applied by the Special Counsel in his review included relevance, depth of understanding and analysis exhibited by the comment, and degree to which multiple commenters expressed the same or similar views on an issue. The Special Counsel prepared a report summarizing the substance of each comment. The comment summary was reviewed by the General Counsel and circulated to the NCUA Board and reviewed by the Board members and staff. NCUA identified in its report the following as significant issues relating to credit union regulation: (1) field of membership and chartering; (2) member business lending; (3) federal credit union ownership of fixed assets; (4) expansion of national credit union share insurance coverage; and (5) expanded powers for credit unions. For these, NCUA took various actions to address the issues raised in the comments. For example, NCUA modified and updated its field of credit union membership by revising the definition of a local community, rural district and underserved area, which provided greater flexibility to federal credit unions seeking to add a rural district to their field of membership. NCUA also lessened some of the restrictions on member lending to small business; and raised some of the asset thresholds for what would be defined as a small credit union so that fewer requirements would apply to these credit unions. Also, in April 2016, the NCUA Board issued a proposed rule that would eliminate the requirement that federal credit unions must have a plan by which they will achieve full occupancy of premises within an explicit time frame. The proposal would allow for federal credit unions to plan for and manage their use of office space and related premises in accordance with their own strategic plans and risk-management policies. The bank and credit union regulators’ process for the 2007 EGRPRA review also began with Federal Register notices that requested comments on regulations. The regulators then reviewed and assessed the comments and issued a report in 2007 to Congress in which they noted actions they took in some of the areas raised by commenters. Our analysis of the regulators’ responses indicated that the regulators took responsive actions in a few areas. The regulators noted they already had taken action in some cases (including after completion of a pending study and as a result of efforts to work with Congress to obtain statutory changes). However, for the remaining specific concerns, the four regulators indicated that they would not be taking actions. Similar to its response in 2017, NCUA discussed its responses to the significant issues raised about regulations in a separate section of the 2007 report. Our analysis indicated that NCUA took responsive actions in about half of the areas. For example, NCUA adjusted regulations in one case and in another case noted previously taken actions. For comments related to three other areas, NCUA took actions not reflected in the 2007 report because the actions were taken over a longer time frame (in some cases, after 8 years). In the remaining areas, NCUA deemed actions as not being desirable in four cases and outside of its authority in two other cases. The bank regulators do not conduct other retrospective reviews of regulations outside of the EGRPRA process. We requested information from the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC about any discretionary regulatory retrospective reviews that they performed in addition to the EGRPRA review during 2012–2016. All three regulators reported to us they have not conducted any retrospective regulatory reviews outside of EGRPRA since 2012. However, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), federal agencies are required to conduct what are referred to as section 610 reviews. The purpose of these reviews is to determine whether certain rules should be continued without change, amended, or rescinded consistent with the objectives of applicable statutes, to minimize any significant economic impact of the rules upon a substantial number of small entities. Section 610 reviews are to be conducted within 10 years of an applicable rule’s publication. As part of other work, we assessed the bank regulators’ section 610 reviews and found that the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC conducted retrospective reviews that did not fully align with the Regulatory Flexibility Act’s requirements. Officials at each of the agencies stated that they satisfy the requirements to perform section 610 reviews through the EGRPRA review process. However, we found that the requirements of the EGRPRA reviews differ from those of the RFA-required section 610 reviews, and we made recommendations to these regulators to help ensure their compliance with this act in a separate report issued in January 2018. In addition to participating in the EGRPRA review, NCUA also reviews one-third of its regulations every year (each regulation is reviewed every 3 years). NCUA’s “one-third” review employs a public notice and comment process similar to the EGRPRA review. If a specific regulation does not receive any comments, NCUA does not review the regulation. For the 2016 one-third review, NCUA did not receive comments on 5 of 16 regulations and thus these regulations were not reviewed. NCUA made technical changes to 4 of the 11 regulations that received comments. In August 2017, NCUA staff announced they developed a task force for conducting additional regulatory reviews, including developing a 4-year agenda for reviewing and revising NCUA’s regulations. The primary factors they said they intend to use to evaluate their regulations will be the magnitude of the benefit and the degree of effort that credit unions must expend to comply with the regulations. Because the 4-year reviews will be conducted on all of NCUA’s regulations, staff noted that the annual one-third regulatory review process will not be conducted again until 2020. Our analysis of the EGRPRA review found three limitations to the current process. First, the EGRPRA statute does not include CFPB and thus the significant mortgage-related regulations and other regulations that it administers— regulations that banks and credit unions must follow—were not included in the EGRPRA review. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, CFPB was given financial regulatory authority, including for regulations implementing the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (Regulation C); the Truth-in-Lending Act (Regulation Z); and the Truth-in-Savings Act (Regulation DD). These regulations apply to many of the activities that banks and credit unions conduct; the four depository institution regulators conduct the large majority of examinations of these institutions’ compliance with these CFPB-administered regulations. However, EGRPRA was not amended after the Dodd-Frank Act to include CFPB as one of the agencies that must conduct the EGRPRA review. During the 2017 EGRPRA review, the bank regulators only requested public comments on consumer protection regulations for which they have regulatory authority. But the banking regulators still received some comments on the key mortgage regulations and the other regulations that CFPB now administers. Our review of 2017 forum transcripts identified almost 60 comments on mortgage regulations, such as HMDA and TRID. The bank regulators could not address these mortgage regulation-related comments because they no longer had regulatory authority over these regulations; instead, they forwarded these comment letters to CFPB staff. According to CFPB staff, their role in the most recent EGRPRA process was very limited. CFPB staff told us they had no role in assessing the public comments received for purposes of the final 2017 EGRPRA report. According to one bank regulator, the bank regulators did not share non- mortgage regulation-related letters with CFPB staff because those comment letters did not involve CFPB regulations. Another bank regulator told us that CFPB was offered the opportunity to participate in the outreach meetings and were kept informed of the EGRPRA review during the quarterly FFIEC meetings that occurred during the review. Before the report was sent to Congress, CFPB staff said that they reviewed several late-stage drafts, but generally limited their review to ensuring that references to CFPB’s authority and regulations and its role in the EGRPRA process were properly characterized and explained. As a member of FFIEC, which issued the final report, CFPB’s Director was given an opportunity to review the report again just prior to its approval by FFIEC. CFPB must conduct its own reviews of regulations after they are implemented. Section 1022(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act requires CFPB to conduct an assessment of each significant rule or order adopted by the bureau under federal consumer financial law. CFPB must publish a report of the assessment not later than 5 years after the effective date of such rule or order. The assessment must address, among other relevant factors, the rule’s effectiveness in meeting the purposes and objectives of title X of the Dodd-Frank Act and specific goals stated by CFPB. The assessment also must reflect available evidence and any data that CFPB reasonably may collect. Before publishing a report of its assessment, CFPB must invite public comment on recommendations for modifying, expanding, or eliminating the significant rule or order. CFPB announced in Federal Register notices in spring 2017 that it was commencing assessments of rules related to Qualified Mortgage/Ability- to-Repay requirements, remittances, and mortgage servicing regulations. The notices described how CFPB planned to assess the regulations. In each notice, CFPB requested comment from the public on the feasibility and effectiveness of the assessment plan, data, and other factual information that may be useful for executing the plan; recommendations to improve the plan and relevant data; and data and other factual information about the benefits, costs, impacts, and effectiveness of the significant rule. Reports of these assessments are due in late 2018 and early 2019. According to CFPB staff, the requests for data and other factual information are consistent with the statutory requirement that the assessment must reflect available evidence and any data that CFPB reasonably may collect. The Federal Register notices also describe other data sources that CFPB has in-house or has been collecting pursuant to this requirement. CFPB staff told us that they have not yet determined whether certain other regulations that apply to banks and credit unions, such as the revisions to TRID and HMDA requirements, will be designated as significant and thus subjected to the one-time assessments. CFPB staff also told us they anticipate that within approximately 3 years after the effective date of a rule, it generally will have determined whether the rule is a significant rule for section 1022(d) assessment purposes. In tasking the bank regulators with conducting the EGRPRA reviews, Congress indicated its intent was to require these regulators to review all regulations that could be creating undue burden on regulated institutions. According to a Senate committee report relating to EGRPRA, the purpose of the legislation was to minimize unnecessary regulatory impediments for lenders, in a manner consistent with safety and soundness, consumer protection, and other public policy goals, so as to produce greater operational efficiency. Some in Congress have recognized that the omission of CFPB in the EGRPRA process is problematic, and in 2015 legislation was introduced to require that CFPB—and NCUA—formally participate in the EGRPRA review. Currently, without CFPB’s participation, key regulations that affect banks and credit unions may not be subject to the review process. In addition, these regulations may not be reviewed if CFPB does not deem them significant. Further, if reviewed, CFPB’s mandate is for a one-time, not recurring, review. CFPB staff told us that they have two additional initiatives designed to review its regulations, both of which have been announced in CFPB’s spring and fall 2017 Semiannual Regulatory Agendas. First, CFPB launched a program to periodically review individual existing regulations—or portions of large regulations—to identify opportunities to clarify ambiguities, address developments in the marketplace, or modernize or streamline provisions. Second, CFPB launched an internal task force to coordinate and bolster their continuing efforts to identify and relieve regulatory burdens, including with regard to small businesses such as community banks that potentially will address any regulation the agency has under its jurisdiction. Staff told us the agency has been considering suggestions it received from community banks and others on ways to reduce regulatory burden. However, CFPB has not provided public information specifically on the extent to which it intends to review regulations applicable to community banks and credit unions and other institutions or provided information on the timing and frequency of the reviews. In addition, it has not indicated the extent to which it will coordinate the reviews with the federal depository institution regulators as part of the EGRPRA reviews. Until CFPB publicly provides additional information indicating its commitment to periodically review the burden of all its regulations, community banks, credit unions, and other depository institutions may face diminished opportunities for relief from regulatory burden. Second, the federal depository institution regulators have not conducted or reported on quantitative analyses during the EGRPRA process to help them determine if changes to regulations would be warranted. Our analysis of the 2017 report indicated that in responses to comments in which the regulators did not take any actions, the regulators generally only provided their arguments against taking actions and did not cite analysis or data to support their narrative. In contrast, other federal agencies that are similarly tasked with conducting retrospective regulatory reviews are required to follow certain practices for such reviews that could serve as best practices for the depository institution regulators. For example, the Office of Management and Budget’s Circular A-4 guidance on regulatory analysis notes that a good analysis is transparent and should allow qualified third parties reviewing such analyses to clearly see how estimates and conclusions were determined. In addition, executive branch agencies that are tasked under executive orders to conduct retrospective reviews of regulations they issue generally are required under these orders to collect and analyze quantitative data as part of assessing the costs and benefits of changing existing regulations. However, EGRPRA does not require the regulators to collect and report on any quantitative data they collected or analyzed as part of assessing the potential burden of regulations. Conducting and reporting on how they analyzed the impact of potential regulatory changes to address burden could assist the depository institution regulators in conducting their EGRPRA reviews. For example, as discussed previously, Community Reinvestment Act regulations were deemed a significant issue, with commenters questioning the relevance of requiring small banks to make community development loans and suggesting that the asset threshold for this requirement be raised from $1 billion to $5 billion. The regulators told us that if the thresholds were raised, then community development loans would decline, particularly in underserved communities. However, regulators did not collect and analyze data for the EGRPRA review to determine the amount of community development loans provided by banks with assets of less than $1 billion; including a discussion of quantitative analysis might have helped show that community development loans from smaller community banks provided additional credit in communities—and thus helped to demonstrate the benefits of not changing the requirement as commenters requested. By not performing and reporting quantitative analyses where appropriate in the EGRPRA review, the regulators may be missing opportunities to better assess regulatory impacts after a regulation has been implemented, including identifying the need for any changes or benefits from the regulations and making their analyses more transparent to stakeholders. As the Office of Management and Budget’s Circular A-4 guidance on the development of regulatory analysis noted, sound quantitative estimates of costs and benefits, where feasible, are preferable to qualitative descriptions of benefits and costs because they help decision makers understand the magnitudes of the effects of alternative actions. By not fully describing their rationale for the analyses that supported their decisions, regulators may be missing opportunities to better communicate their decisions to stakeholders and the public. Lastly, in the EGRPRA process, the federal depository institution regulators have not assessed the ways that the cumulative burden of the regulations they administer may have created overlapping or duplicative requirements. Under the current process, the regulators have responded to issues raised about individual regulations based on comments they have received, not on bodies of regulations. However, congressional intent in tasking the depository institution regulators with the EGRPRA reviews was to ensure that they considered the cumulative effect of financial regulations. A 1995 Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs report stated while no one regulation can be singled out as being the most burdensome, and most have meritorious goals, the aggregate burden of banking regulations ultimately affects a bank’s operations, its profitability, and the cost of credit to customers. For example, financial regulations may have created overlapping or duplicative regulations in the areas of safety and soundness. One primary concern noted in the EGRPRA 2017 report was the amount of information or data banks are required to provide to regulators. For example, the cumulative burden of information collection was raised by commenters in relation to Call Reports, Community Reinvestment Act, and BSA/AML requirements. But in the EGRPRA report, the regulators did not examine how the various reporting requirements might relate to each other or how they might collectively affect institutions. In contrast, the executive branch agencies that conduct retrospective regulatory reviews must consider the cumulative effects of their own regulations, including cumulative burdens. For example, Executive Order 13563 directs agencies, to the extent practicable, to consider the costs of cumulative regulations. Executive Order 13563 does not apply to independent regulatory agencies such as the Federal Reserve, FDIC, OCC, NCUA, or CFPB. A memorandum from the Office of Management and Budget provided guidance to the agencies required to follow this order for assessing the cumulative burden and costs of regulations. The actions suggested for careful consideration include conducting early consultations with affected stakeholders to discuss potential interactions between rulemaking under consideration and existing regulations as well as other anticipated regulatory requirements. The executive order also directs agencies to consider regulations that appear to be attempting to achieve the same goal. However, other researchers often acknowledge that cumulative assessments of burden are difficult. Nevertheless, until the Federal Reserve, FDIC, OCC, and NCUA identify ways to consider the cumulative burden of regulations, they may miss opportunities to streamline bodies of regulations to reduce the overall compliance burden among financial institutions, including community banks and credit unions. For example, regulations applicable to specific activities of banks, such as lending or capital, could be assessed to determine if they have overlapping or duplicative requirements that could be revised without materially reducing the benefits sought by the regulations. New regulations for financial institutions enacted in recent years have helped protect mortgage borrowers, increase the safety and soundness of the financial system, and facilitate anti-terrorism and anti-money laundering efforts. But the regulations also entail compliance burdens, particularly for smaller institutions such as community banks and credit unions, and the cumulative burden on these institutions can be significant. Representatives from the institutions with which we spoke cited three sets of regulations—HMDA, BSA/AML, and TRID—as most burdensome for reasons that included their complexity. In particular, the complexity of TRID regulations appears to have contributed to misunderstandings that in turn caused institutions to take unnecessary actions. While regulators have acted to reduce burdens associated with the regulations, CFPB has not assessed the effectiveness of its TRID guidance. Federal internal control standards require agencies to analyze and respond to risks to achieving their objectives, and CFPB’s objectives include addressing regulations that are unduly burdensome. Assessing the effectiveness of TRID guidance represents an opportunity to reduce misunderstandings that create additional burden for institutions and also affect individual consumers (for instance, by delaying mortgage closings). The federal depository institution regulators (FDIC, Federal Reserve, OCC, as well as NCUA) also have opportunities to enhance the activities they undertake during EGRPRA reviews. Congress intended that the burden of all regulations applicable to depository institutions would be periodically assessed and reduced through the EGRPRA process. But because CFPB has not been included in this process, the regulations for which it is responsible were not assessed, and CFPB has not yet provided public information about what regulations it will review, and when, and whether it will coordinate with other regulators during EGPRA reviews. Until such information is publicly available, the extent to which the regulatory burden of CFPB regulation will be periodically addressed remains unclear. The effectiveness of the EGRPRA process also has been hampered by other limitations, including not conducting and reporting on depository institution regulators’ analysis of quantitative data and assessing the cumulative effect of regulations on institutions. Addressing these limitations in their EGRPRA processes likely would make the analyses the regulators perform more transparent, and potentially result in additional burden reduction. We make a total of 10 recommendations, which consist of 2 recommendations to CFPB, 2 to FDIC, 2 to the Federal Reserve, 2 to OCC, and 2 to NCUA. The Director of CFPB should assess the effectiveness of TRID guidance to determine the extent to which TRID’s requirements are accurately understood and take steps to address any issues as necessary. (Recommendation 1) The Director of CFPB should issue public information on its plans for reviewing regulations applicable to banks and credit unions, including information describing the scope of regulations the timing and frequency of the reviews, and the extent to which the reviews will be coordinated with the federal depository institution regulators as part of their periodic EGRPRA reviews. (Recommendation 2) The Chairman, FDIC, should, as part of the EGRPRA process, develop plans for their regulatory analyses describing how they will conduct and report on quantitative analysis whenever feasible to strengthen the rigor and transparency of the EGRPRA process. (Recommendation 3) The Chairman, FDIC, should, as part of the EGRPRA process, develop plans for conducting evaluations that would identify opportunities for streamlining bodies of regulation. (Recommendation 4) The Chair, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, should, as part of the EGRPRA process develop plans for their regulatory analyses describing how they will conduct and report on quantitative analysis whenever feasible to strengthen the rigor and transparency of the EGRPRA process. (Recommendation 5) The Chair, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, should, as part of the EGRPRA process, develop plans for conducting evaluations that would identify opportunities to streamline bodies of regulation. (Recommendation 6) The Comptroller of the Currency should, as part of the EGRPRA process, develop plans for their regulatory analyses describing how they will conduct and report on quantitative analysis whenever feasible to strengthen the rigor and transparency of the EGRPRA process. (Recommendation 7) The Comptroller of the Currency should, as part of the EGRPRA process, develop plans for conducting evaluations that would identify opportunities to streamline bodies of regulation. (Recommendation 8) The Chair of NCUA should, as part of the EGRPRA process, develop plans for their regulatory analyses describing how they will conduct and report on quantitative analysis whenever feasible to strengthen the rigor and transparency of the EGRPRA process. (Recommendation 9) The Chair of NCUA should, as part of the EGRPRA process, develop plans for conducting evaluations that would identify opportunities to streamline bodies of regulation. (Recommendation 10) We provided a draft of this report to CFPB, FDIC, FinCEN, the Federal Reserve, NCUA, and OCC. We received written comments from CFPB, FDIC, the Federal Reserve, NCUA, and OCC that we have reprinted in appendixes II through VI, respectively. CFPB, FDIC, FinCEN, the Federal Reserve, NCUA, and OCC also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. In its written comments, CFPB agreed with the recommendation to assess its TRID guidance to determine the extent to which it is understood. CFPB stated it intends to solicit public input on how it can improve its regulatory guidance and implementation support. In addition, CFPB agreed with the recommendation on issuing public information on its plan for reviewing regulations. CFPB committed to developing additional plans with respect to their reviews of key regulations and to publicly releasing such information and in the interim, CFPB stated it intends to solicit public input on how it should approach reviewing regulations. FDIC stated that it appreciated the two recommendations and stated that it would work with the Federal Reserve and OCC to find the most appropriate ways to ensure that the three regulators continue to enhance their rulemaking analyses as part of the EGRPRA process. In addition, FDIC stated that as part of the EGRPRA review process, it would continue to monitor the cumulative effects of regulation through for example, a review of the community and quarterly banking studies and community bank Call Report data. The Federal Reserve agreed with the two recommendations pertaining to the EGRPRA process. Regarding the need conduct and report on quantitative analysis whenever feasible to strengthen and to increase the transparency of the EGRPRA process, the Federal Reserve plans to coordinate with FDIC and OCC to identify opportunities to conduct quantitative analyses where feasible during future EGRPRA reviews. With respect to the second recommendation, the Federal Reserve agreed that the cumulative impact of regulations on depository institutions is important and plans to coordinate with FDIC and OCC to identify further opportunities to seek comment on bodies of regulations and how they could be streamlined. NCUA acknowledged the report’s conclusions as part of their voluntary compliance with the EGRPRA process; NCUA should improve its qualitative analysis and develop plans for continued reductions to regulatory burden within the credit union industry. In its letter, NCUA noted it has appointed a regulatory review task force charged with reviewing and developing a four-year plan for revising their regulations and the review will consider the benefits of NCUA’s regulations as well as the burden they have on credit unions. In its written comments, OCC stated that it understood the importance of GAO’s recommendations. They stated they OCC will consult and coordinate with the Federal Reserve and FDIC to develop plans for regulatory analysis, including how the regulators should conduct and report on quantitative analysis and also, will work with these regulators to increase the transparency of the EGRPRA process. OCC also stated it will consult with these regulators to develop plans, as part of the EGRPRA process, to conduct evaluations that identify ways to decrease the regulatory burden created by bodies of regulations. As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to CFPB, FDIC, FinCEN, the Federal Reserve, NCUA, and OCC. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.

GAO staff who made major contributions to this report are listed in appendix VII. This report examines the burdens that regulatory compliance places on community banks and credit unions and actions that federal regulators have taken to reduce these burdens; specifically: (1) the financial regulations that community banks and credit unions reported viewing as the most burdensome, the characteristics of those regulations that make them burdensome, and the benefits are associated with those regulations and (2) federal financial regulators’ efforts to reduce any existing regulatory burden on community banks and credit unions. To identify the regulations that community banks and credit unions viewed as the most burdensome, we first constructed a sample frame of financial institutions that met certain criteria for being classified as community banks or community-focused credit unions for the purposes of this review. These sample frames were then used as the basis for drawing our non-probability samples of institutions for purposes of interviews, focus group participation, and document review. Defining a community bank is important because, as we have reported, regulatory compliance may be more burdensome for community banks and credit unions than for larger banks because they are not as able to benefit from economies of scale in compliance resources. While there is no single consensus definition for what constitutes a community bank, we reviewed criteria for defining community banks developed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), officials from the Independent Community Bankers Association, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Based on this review, we determined that institutions that had the following characteristics would be the most appropriate to include in our universe of institutions, (1) fewer total assets, (2) engage in traditional lending and deposit taking activities, have limited geographic scope, and (3) did not have complex operating structures. To identify banks that met these characteristics, we began with all banks that filed a Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report) for the first quarter of 2016 (March 31, 2016) and are not themselves subsidiaries of another bank that filed a Call Report. We then excluded banks using an asset-size threshold, to ensure we are including only small institutions. Based on interviews with regulators and our review of the FDIC’s community bank study, we targeted institutions around the $1 billion in assets as the group that could be relatively representative of the experiences of many community banks in complying with regulations. Upon review of the Call Reports data, we found that the banks in the 90th percentile by asset size were had about $1.2 billion, and we selected this to be an appropriate cutoff for our sample frame. In addition we excluded institutions with characteristics suggesting they do not engage in typical community banking activities like such as deposit-taking and lending; and those with characteristics suggesting they conduct more specialized operations not typical of community banking, such as credit card banks. In addition to ensure that we excluded banks whose views of regulatory compliance might be influenced by being part of a large and/or complex organization, we also excluded banks with foreign offices and banks that are subsidiaries of either foreign banks or of holding companies with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets. Finally, as a practical matter, we excluded banks for which we could not obtain data on one or more of the characteristics listed below. We also relied on a similar framework to construct a sample frame for credit unions. We sought to identify credit unions that were relatively small, engaged in traditional lending and deposit taking activities, and had limited geographic scope. To do this, we began with all insured credit unions that filed a Call Report for the first quarter of 2016 (March 31, 2016). We then excluded credit unions using an asset-size threshold of $860 million, which is the 95th percentile of credit unions, to ensure we are including only smaller institutions. The percentile of credit unions was higher than the percentile of banks because there are more large banks than there are credit unions. We then excluded credit unions that did not engage in activities that are typical of community lending, such as taking deposits, making loans and leases, and providing consumer checking accounts, as well as those credit unions with headquarters outside of the United States. We assessed the reliability of data from FFIEC, FDIC, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and NCUA by reviewing relevant documentation and electronically testing the data for missing values or obvious errors, and we found the data from these sources to be sufficiently reliable for the purpose of creating sample frames of community banks and credit unions. The sample frames were then used as the basis for drawing our nonprobability samples of institutions for purposes of interviews and focus groups. To identify regulations that community banks and credit unions viewed as among the most burdensome, we conducted structured interviews and focus groups with a sample of a total of 64 community banks and credit unions. To reduce the possibility of bias, we selected the institutions to ensure that banks and credit unions with different asset sizes and from different regions of the country were included. We also included at least one bank overseen by each of the three primary federal depository institution regulators, Federal Reserve, FDIC, NCUA, and OCC in the sample. We interviewed 17 institutions (10 banks and 7 credit unions) about which regulations their institutions experienced the most compliance burden. On the basis of the results of these interviews, we determined that considerable consensus existed among these institutions as to which regulations were seen as most burdensome, including those relating to mortgage fees and terms disclosures to consumers, mortgage borrower and loan characteristics reporting, and anti-money laundering activities. As a result, we determined to conduct focus groups with institutions to identify the characteristics of the regulations identified in our interviews that made these regulations burdensome. To identify the burdensome characteristics of the regulations identified in our preliminary interviews, we selected institutions to participate in three focus groups of community banks and three focus groups of credit unions. For the first focus group of community banks, we randomly selected 20 banks among 647 banks between $500 million and $1 billion located in nine U.S. census geographical areas using the sample frame of community banks we developed, and contacted them asking for their participation. Seven of the 20 banks agreed to participate in the first focus group. However, mortgages represented a low percentage of the assets of two participants in the first focus group, so we revised our selection criteria because two of the regulations identified as burdensome were related to mortgages. For the remaining two focus groups with community banks, we randomly selected institutions with more than $45 million and no more than $1.2 billion in assets to ensure that they would be required to comply with the mortgage characteristics reporting and with at least a 10 percent mortgage to asset ratio to better ensure that they would be sufficiently experienced with mortgage regulations. After identifying the large percentage of FDIC regulated banks in the first 20 banks we contacted, we decided to prioritize contact with banks regulated by OCC and the Federal Reserve for the institutions on our list. When banks declined or when we determined an institution merged or was acquired, we selected a new institution from that state and preferenced institutions regulated by OCC and the Federal Reserve. The three focus groups totaled 23 community banks with a range of assets. We used a similar selection process for three focus groups of credit unions consisting of 23 credit unions. We selected credit unions with at least $45 million in assets so that they would be required to comply with the mortgage regulations and with at least a 10 percent mortgage-to-asset ratio. During each of the focus groups, we asked the representatives from participating institutions what characteristics of the relevant regulations made them burdensome with which to comply. We also polled them about the extent to which they had to take various actions to comply with regulations, including hiring or expanding staff resources, investing in additional information technology resources, or conducting staff training. During the focus groups, we also confirmed with the participants that the three sets of regulations (on mortgage fee and other disclosures to consumers, reporting of mortgage borrower and loan characteristics, and anti-money laundering activities) were generally the ones they found most burdensome. To identify in more detail the steps a community bank or credit union may take to comply with the regulations identified as among the most burdensome, we also conducted an in-depth on-site interview with one community bank. We selected this institution by limiting the community bank sample to only those banks in the middle 80 percent of the distribution in terms of assets, mortgage lending, small business lending, and lending in general that were no more than 70 miles from Washington, D.C. We limited the sample in this way to ensure that the institution was not an outlier in terms of activities or size, and to limit the travel resources needed to conduct the site visit. We also interviewed associations representing consumers to understand the benefits of these regulations. These groups were selected using professional judgement of their knowledge of relevant banking regulations. We interviewed associations representing banks and credit unions. To identify the requirements of the regulations identified as among the most burdensome, we reviewed the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) and its implementing regulation, Regulation C; Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering (BSA/AML) regulations, including those deriving from the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act, commonly known as the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), and the 2001 USA PATRIOT Act; and the Integrated Mortgage Disclosure Rule Under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) with the implementing Regulation X; and the Truth-in-Lending Act (TILA) with implementing Regulation Z. We reviewed the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) small entity guidance and supporting materials on the TILA- RESPA Integrated Disclosure (TRID) regulation and HMDA to clarify the specific requirements of each rule and to analyze the information included in the CFPB guidance. We interviewed staff from each of the federal regulators responsible for implementing the regulations, as well as from the federal regulators responsible for examining community banks and credit unions. To identify the potential benefits of the regulations that were considered burdensome by community banks and credit unions, we interviewed representatives from four community groups to document their perspectives on the benefits provided by the identified regulations. To determine whether the bank regulators had required banks to comply with certain provisions from which the institutions might be exempt, we identified eight exemptions from the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 from which community banks and credit unions should be exempt and reviewed a small group of the most recent examinations to identify instances in which a regulator may not have applied an exemption for which a bank was eligible. We reviewed 20 safety and soundness and consumer compliance examination reports of community banks and eight safety and soundness examination reports of credit unions. The bank examination reports we reviewed were for the first 20 community banks we contacted requesting participation in the first focus group. The bank examination reports included examinations from all three bank regulators (FDIC, Federal Reserve, and OCC). The NCUA examination reports we reviewed were for the eight credit unions that participated in the second focus group of credit unions. Because of the limited number of the examinations we reviewed, we cannot generalize whether regulators extended the exemptions to all qualifying institutions. To assess the federal financial regulators’ efforts to reduce the existing regulatory burden on community banks and credit unions, we identified the mechanisms the regulators used to identify burdensome regulations and actions to reduce potential burden. We reviewed laws and congressional and agency documentation. More specifically, we reviewed the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 (EGRPRA) that requires the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC to review all their regulations every 10 years and identify areas of the regulations that are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome and reviewed the 1995 Senate Banking Committee report, which described the intent of the legislation. We reviewed the Federal Register notices that bank regulators and NCUA published requesting comments on their regulations. We also reviewed over 200 comment letters that the regulators had received through the EGRPRA process from community banks, credit unions, their trade associations, and others, as well as the transcripts of all six public forums regulators held as part the 2017 EGRPRA regulatory review efforts they conducted. We analyzed the extent to which the depository institutions regulators addressed the issues raised in comments received for the review. In assessing the 2017 and 2007 EGRPRA reports sent to Congress, we reviewed the significant issues identified by the regulators and determined the extent to which the regulators proposed or took actions in response to the comments relating to burden on small entities. We compared the requirements of Executive Orders 12866, 13563, and 13610 issued by Office of Management and Budget with the actions taken by the regulators in implementing their 10-year regulatory retrospective review. The executive orders included requirements on how executive branch agencies should conduct retrospective reviews of their regulations. For both objectives, we interviewed representatives from CFPB, FDIC, Federal Reserve, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, NCUA, and OCC to identify any steps that regulators took to reduce the compliance burden associated with each of the identified regulations and to understand how they conduct retrospective reviews. We also interviewed representatives of the Small Business Administration’s Office of Advocacy, which reviews and comments on the burdens of regulations affecting small businesses, including community banks. We conducted this performance audit from March 2016 to February 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. In addition to the contact name above, Cody J.

Smaller community banks and credit unions must comply with some of the regulations, but compliance can be more challenging and costly for these institutions. GAO examined (1) the regulations community banks and credit unions viewed as most burdensome and why, and (2) efforts by depository institution regulators to reduce any regulatory burden. GAO analyzed regulations and interviewed more than 60 community banks and credit unions (selected based on asset size and financial activities), regulators, and industry associations and consumer groups. GAO also analyzed letters and transcripts commenting on regulatory burden that regulators prepared responding to the comments. Interviews and focus groups GAO conducted with representatives of over 60 community banks and credit unions indicated regulations for reporting mortgage characteristics, reviewing transactions for potentially illicit activity, and disclosing mortgage terms and costs to consumers were the most burdensome. Institution representatives said these regulations were time-consuming and costly to comply with, in part because the requirements were complex, required individual reports that had to be reviewed for accuracy, or mandated actions within specific timeframes. However, regulators and others noted that the regulations were essential to preventing lending discrimination and use of the banking system for illicit activity, and they were acting to reduce compliance burdens. Institution representatives also said that the new mortgage disclosure regulations increased compliance costs, added significant time to loan closings, and resulted in institutions absorbing costs when others, such as appraisers and inspectors, changed disclosed fees. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued guidance and conducted other outreach to educate institutions after issuing these regulations in 2013. But GAO found that some compliance burdens arose from misunderstanding the disclosure regulations—which in turn may have led institutions to take actions not actually required. Assessing the effectiveness of the guidance for the disclosure regulations could help mitigate the misunderstandings and thus also reduce compliance burdens. Regulators of community banks and credit unions—the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the National Credit Union Administration—conduct decennial reviews to obtain industry comments on regulatory burden. But the reviews, conducted under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 (EGRPRA), had the following limitations: CFPB and the consumer financial regulations for which it is responsible were not included. Unlike executive branch agencies, the depository institution regulators are not required to analyze and report quantitative-based rationales for their responses to comments. Regulators do not assess the cumulative burden of the regulations they administer. CFPB has formed an internal group that will be tasked with reviewing regulations it administers, but the agency has not publicly announced the scope of regulations included, the timing and frequency of the reviews, and the extent to which they will be coordinated with the other federal banking and credit union regulators as part of their periodic EGRPRA reviews. Congressional intent in mandating that these regulators review their regulations was that the cumulative effect of all federal financial regulations be considered. In addition, sound practices required of other federal agencies require them to analyze and report their assessments when reviewing regulations. Documenting in plans how the depository institution regulators would address these EGRPRA limitations would better ensure that all regulations relevant to community banks and credit unions were reviewed, likely improve the analyses the regulators perform, and potentially result in additional burden reduction. GAO makes a total of 10 recommendations to CFPB and the depository institution regulators. CFPB should assess the effectiveness of guidance on mortgage disclosure regulations and publicly issue its plans for the scope and timing of its regulation reviews and coordinate these with the other regulators' review process. As part of their burden reviews, the depository institution regulators should develop plans to report quantitative rationales for their actions and addressing the cumulative burden of regulations. In written comments, CFPB and the four depository institution regulators generally agreed with the recommendations.""]","18098","gov_report","en","None","0708332f2b27ef8843c261a207213212e80322ad79286259","Summary:","gov_report","532","\n\nThe report ""Burdens of Regulation and Compliance Compliance: A Burden Reduction Efforts of Federal Financial Institutions"" by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) examines 2018, explores the burdens of regulations that financial regulations and compliance placed on community banks and credit un"
"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nFEMA’s mission is to help people before, during, and after disasters. It provides assistance to those affected by emergencies and disasters by supplying immediate needs (e.g., ice, water, food, and temporary housing) and providing financial assistance grants for damage to personal or public property. FEMA also provides non-disaster assistance grants to improve the nation’s preparedness, readiness, and resilience to all hazards. FEMA accomplishes a large part of its mission through awarding grants to state, local, and tribal governments and nongovernmental entities to help communities prevent, prepare for, protect against, mitigate the effects of, respond to, and recover from disasters and terrorist attacks. As previously mentioned, for fiscal years 2005 through 2014, the agency obligated about $104.5 billion in disaster relief grants. In addition, as of April 2018, the four major disasters in 2017—hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria; and the California wildfires—had resulted in over $22 billion in FEMA grants. The current FEMA grants management environment is highly complex with many stakeholders, IT systems, and users. Specifically, this environment is comprised of 45 active disaster and non-disaster grant programs, which are grouped into 12 distinct grant categories. For example, one program in the Preparedness: Fire category is the Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) program, which provides grants to fire departments, nonaffiliated emergency medical service organizations, and state fire training academies to support firefighting and emergency response needs. As another example, the Housing Assistance grant program is in the Recovery Assistance for Individuals category and provides financial assistance to individuals and households in geographical areas that have been declared an emergency or major disaster by the President. Table 1 lists FEMA’s non-disaster and disaster-based grant categories. According to FEMA, the processes for managing these different types of grants vary because the grant programs were developed independently by at least 18 separate authorizing laws that were enacted over a 62-year period (from 1947 through 2009). The various laws call for different administrative and reporting requirements. For example, the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended, established the statutory authority for 11 of the grant programs, such as the administration of Public Assistance and Individual Assistance grant programs after a presidentially declared disaster. The act also requires the FEMA Administrator to submit an annual report to the President and Congress covering FEMA’s expenditures, contributions, work, and accomplishments, pursuant to the act. As another example, the National Dam Safety Program Act established one of the grant programs aimed at providing financial assistance to improve dam safety. Key stakeholders in modernizing the IT grants management environment include the internal FEMA officials that review, approve, and monitor the grants awarded, such as grant specialists, program analysts, and supervisors. FEMA has estimated that it will need to support about 5,000 simultaneous internal users of its grants management systems. Other users include the grant recipients that apply for, receive, and submit reports on their grant awards; these are considered the external system users. These grant recipients can include individuals, states, local governments, Indian tribes, institutions of higher education, and nonprofit organizations. FEMA has estimated that there are hundreds of thousands of external users of its grants systems. The administration of the many different grant programs is distributed across four divisions within FEMA’s organizational structure. Figure 1 provides an overview of FEMA’s organizational structure and the divisions that are responsible for administering grants. Within three of the four divisions—Resilience, United States Fire Administration, and Office of Response and Recovery—16 different grant program offices are collectively responsible for administering the 45 grant programs. The fourth division consists of 10 regional offices that help administer grants within their designated geographical regions. For example, the Office of Response and Recovery division oversees three different offices that administer 13 grant programs that are largely related to providing assistance in response to presidentially declared disasters. Figure 2 shows the number of grant programs administered by each of the four divisions’ grant program and regional offices. In addition, appendix II lists the names of the 45 grant programs. FEMA’s OCIO is responsible for developing, enhancing, and maintaining the agency’s IT systems, and for increasing efficiencies and cooperation across the entire organization. However, we and the DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) have previously reported that the grant programs and regional offices develop information systems independent of the OCIO and that this has contributed to the agency’s disparate IT environment. We and the DHS OIG have reported that this disparate IT environment was due, in part, to FEMA’s decentralized IT budget and acquisition practices. For example, from fiscal years 2010 through 2015, the OCIO’s budget represented about one-third of the agency’s IT budget, with the grant program offices accounting for the remaining two-thirds of that budget. In February 2018, the OIG found that FEMA had shown limited progress in improving its IT management and that many of the issues reported in prior audits remained unchanged. As such, the OIG initiated a more comprehensive audit of the agency’s IT management that is ongoing. FEMA has identified 10 primary legacy IT systems that support its grants management activities. According to the agency, most of these systems were developed to support specific grant programs or grant categories. Table 2 summarizes the 10 primary legacy systems. According to FEMA officials, the 10 primary grant systems are all in operation (several have been for decades) and are not interoperable. As a result, individual grant programs and regional offices have independently developed work arounds intended to address existing capability gaps with the primary systems. FEMA officials stated that while these work arounds have helped the agency partially address capability gaps with its primary systems, they are often nonstandardized processes, and introduce the potential for information security risks and errors. This environment has contributed to labor-intensive manual processes and an increased burden for grant recipients. The disparate systems have also led to poor information sharing and reporting capabilities, as well as difficulty reconciling financial data. The DHS OIG and we have previously highlighted challenges with FEMA’s past attempts to modernize its grant management systems. For example, In December 2006, the DHS OIG reported that EMMIE, an effort to modernize its grants management systems and provide a single grants processing solution, was being developed without a clear understanding and definition of the future solution. The report also identified the need to ensure crosscutting participation from headquarters, regions, and states in developing and maintaining a complete, documented set of FEMA business and system requirements. In April 2016, we found weaknesses in FEMA’s development of the EMMIE system. For example, we noted that the system was implemented without sufficient documentation of system requirements, an acquisition strategy, up-to-date cost estimate and schedule, total amount spent to develop the system, or a systems integration plan. In response to our findings and related recommendations, FEMA took action to address these issues. For example, the agency implemented a requirements management process that, among other things, provided guidance to programs on analyzing requirements to ensure that they are complete and verifiable. We reported in November 2017 that EMMIE lacked the ability to collect information on all pre-award activities and, as a result, agency officials said that they and applicants used ad hoc reports and personal tracking documents to manage and monitor the progress of grant applications. FEMA officials added that applicants often struggled to access the system and that the system was not user friendly. Due to EMMIE’s shortfalls, the agency had to develop another system in 2017 to supplement EMMIE with additional grant tracking and case management capabilities. FEMA initiated GMM in 2015, in part, due to EMMIE’s failed attempt to modernize the agency’s grants management environment. The program is intended to modernize and streamline the agency’s grants management environment. To help streamline the agency’s grants management processes, the program established a standard framework intended to represent a common grants management lifecycle. The framework consists of five sequential phases—pre-award, award, post-award, closeout, and post- closeout—along with a sixth phase dedicated to continuous grant program management activities, such as analyzing data and producing reports on grant awards and managing IT systems. FEMA also established 43 distinct business functions associated with these six lifecycle phases. Figure 3 provides the general activities that may occur in each of the grant lifecycle phases, but specific activities would depend on the type of grant being administered (i.e., disaster versus non-disaster). GMM is expected to be implemented within the complex IT environment that currently exists at FEMA. For example, the program is intended to replace the 10 legacy grants management systems, and potentially many additional subsystems, with a single IT system. Each of the 10 legacy systems was developed with its own database(s) and with no standardization of the grants management data and, according to FEMA officials, this legacy data has grown significantly over time. Accordingly, FEMA will need to migrate, analyze, and standardize the grants management data before transitioning it to GMM. The agency awarded a contract in June 2016 to support the data migration efforts for GMM. The agency also implemented a data staging environment in October 2017 to migrate the legacy data and identify opportunities to improve the quality of the data. Further, the GMM system is expected to interface with a total of 38 other systems. These include 19 systems external to DHS (e.g., those provided by commercial entities or other federal government agencies) and 19 systems internal to DHS or FEMA. Some of the internal FEMA systems are undergoing their own modernization efforts and will need to be coordinated with GMM, such as the agency’s financial management systems, national flood insurance systems, and enterprise data warehouses. For example, FEMA’s Financial Systems Modernization Program was originally expected to deliver a new financial system in time to interface with GMM. However, the financial modernization has been delayed until after GMM is to be fully implemented; thus, GMM will instead need to interface with the legacy financial system. As a result, GMM is in the process of removing one of its key performance parameters in the acquisition program baseline related to financial systems interoperability and timeliness of data exchanged. In May 2017, DHS approved the acquisition program baseline for GMM. The baseline estimated the total lifecycle costs to be about $251 million, initial operational capability to be achieved by September 2019, and full operational capability to be achieved by September 2020. FEMA intends to develop and deploy its own software applications for GMM using a combination of commercial-off-the-shelf software, open source software, and custom developed code. The agency plans to rely on an Agile software development approach. According to FEMA planning documentation, the agency plans to fully deliver GMM by September 2020 over eight Agile development increments. Agile development is a type of incremental development, which calls for the rapid delivery of software in small, short increments. Many organizations, especially in the federal government, are accustomed to using a waterfall software development model. This type of model typically consists of long, sequential phases, and differs significantly from the Agile development approach. We have previously reported that DHS has sought to establish Agile software development as the preferred method for acquiring and delivering IT capabilities. However, the department has not yet completed critical actions necessary to update its guidance, policies, and practices for Agile programs, in areas such as, developing lifecycle cost estimates, managing IT requirements, testing and evaluation, oversight at key decision points, and ensuring cybersecurity. (See appendix III for more details on the Agile software development approach.) FEMA’s acquisition approach includes using contract support to assist with the development and deployment efforts. The agency selected a public cloud environment to host the computing infrastructure. In addition, from March through July 2017, the agency used a short-term contract aimed at developing prototypes of GMM functionality for grant tracking and monitoring, case management of disaster survivors, grant reporting, and grant closeout. The agency planned to award a second development contract by December 2017 to complete the GMM system (beyond the prototypes) and to begin this work in September 2018. However, due to delays in awarding the second contract to develop the complete GMM system, in January 2018, the program extended the scope and time frames of the initial short-term prototype contract for an additional year to develop the first increment of the GMM system— referred to as the AFG pilot. On August 31, 2018, FEMA awarded the second development contract, which is intended to deliver the remaining functionality beyond the AFG pilot (i.e., increments 2 through 8). FEMA officials subsequently issued a 90-day planning task order for the Agile development contractor to define the work that needs to be done to deliver GMM and the level of effort needed to accomplish that work. However, the planning task order was paused after a bid protest was filed with GAO in September 2018. According to FEMA officials, they resumed work on the planning task order after the bid protest was withdrawn by the protester on November 20, 2018, and then the work was paused again during the partial government shutdown from December 22, 2018, through January 25, 2019. FEMA began working on the AFG pilot—GMM’s first increment—in January 2018. This increment was intended to pilot GMM’s use of Agile development methods to replace core functionality for the AFG system (i.e., one of the 10 legacy systems).This system supports three preparedness/fire-related grant programs—Assistance to Firefighters Grants Program, Fire Prevention and Safety Grant Program, and Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Grant Program. According to FEMA officials, the AFG system was selected as the first system to be replaced because it is costly to maintain and the DHS OIG had identified cybersecurity concerns with the system. Among the 43 GMM business functions discussed earlier in this report, FEMA officials specified 19 functions to be delivered in the AFG pilot. Figure 4 shows the planned time frames for delivering the AFG pilot in increment 1 (which consisted of four 3-month Agile development sub- increments), as of August 2018. As of August 2018, the program was working on sub-increment 1C of the pilot. In September 2018, GMM deployed its first set of functionality to a total of 19 AFG users—which included seven of 169 total internal AFG users, and 12 of more than 153,000 external AFG users. The functionality supported four of the 19 business functions that are related to the closeout of grants (i.e., the process by which all applicable administrative actions and all required work to award a grant have been completed). This functionality included tasks such as evaluation of final financial reports submitted by grant recipients and final reconciliation of finances (e.g., final disbursement to recipients and return of unobligated federal funds). According to FEMA officials, closeout functionality was selected first for deployment because it was the most costly component of the legacy AFG system to maintain, as it is an entirely manual and labor-intensive process. The remaining AFG functionality and remaining AFG users are to be deployed by the end of the AFG pilot. The GMM program is executed by a program management office, which is overseen by a program manager and program executive. This office is responsible for directing the day-to-day operations and ensuring completion of GMM program goals and objectives. The program office resides within the Office of Response and Recovery, which is headed by an Associate Administrator who reports to the FEMA Administrator. In addition, the GMM program executive (who is also the Regional Administrator for FEMA Region IX) reports directly to the FEMA Administrator. GMM is designated as a level 2 major acquisition, which means that it is subject to oversight by the DHS acquisition review board. The board is chaired by the DHS Undersecretary for Management and is made up of executive-level members, such as the DHS Chief Information Officer. The acquisition review board serves as the departmental executive board that decides whether to approve GMM through key acquisition milestones and reviews the program’s progress and its compliance with approved documentation every 6 months. The board approved the acquisition program baseline for GMM in May 2017 (i.e., estimated costs to be about $251 million and full operational capability to be achieved by September 2020). In addition, the program is reviewed on a monthly basis by FEMA’s Grants Management Executive Steering Group. This group is chaired by the Deputy Administrator of FEMA. Further, DHS’s Financial Systems Modernization Executive Steering Committee, chaired by the DHS Chief Financial Officer, meets monthly and is to provide guidance, oversight, and support to GMM. For government organizations, including FEMA, cybersecurity is a key element in maintaining the public trust. Inadequately protected systems may be vulnerable to insider threats. Such systems are also vulnerable to the risk of intrusion by individuals or groups with malicious intent who could unlawfully access the systems to obtain sensitive information, disrupt operations, or launch attacks against other computer systems and networks. Moreover, cyber-based threats to federal information systems are evolving and growing. Accordingly, we designated cybersecurity as a government-wide high risk area 22 years ago, in 1997, and it has since remained on our high-risk list. Federal law and guidance specify requirements for protecting federal information and information systems. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014 requires executive branch agencies to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide cybersecurity program to provide security for the information and information systems that support operations and assets of the agency. The act also tasks NIST with developing, for systems other than those for national security, standards and guidelines to be used by all agencies to establish minimum cybersecurity requirements for information and information systems based on their level of cybersecurity risk. Accordingly, NIST developed a risk management framework of standards and guidelines for agencies to follow in developing cybersecurity programs. The framework addresses broad cybersecurity and risk management activities, including categorizing the system’s impact level; selecting, implementing, and assessing security controls; authorizing the system to operate (based on progress in remediating control weaknesses and an assessment of residual risk); and monitoring the efficacy of controls on an ongoing basis. Figure 5 provides an overview of this framework. Prior DHS OIG assessments, such as the annual evaluation of DHS’s cybersecurity program, have identified issues with FEMA’s cybersecurity practices. For example, in 2016, the OIG reported that FEMA was operating 111 systems without an authorization to operate. In addition, the agency had not created any corrective action plans for 11 of the systems that were classified as “Secret” or “Top Secret,” thus limiting its ability to ensure that all identified cybersecurity weaknesses were mitigated in a timely manner. The OIG further reported that, for several years, FEMA was consistently below DHS’s 90 percent target for remediating corrective action plans, with scores ranging from 73 to 84 percent. Further, the OIG reported that FEMA had a significant number of open corrective action plans (18,654) and that most of these plans did not contain sufficient information to address identified weaknesses. In 2017, the OIG reported that FEMA had made progress in addressing security weaknesses. For example, it reported that the agency had reduced the number of systems it was operating without an authorization to operate from 111 to 15 systems. According to GAO’s Business Process Reengineering Assessment Guide and the Software Engineering Institute’s Capability Maturity Model Integration® for Development, successful business process reengineering can enable agencies to replace their inefficient and outmoded processes with streamlined processes that can more effectively serve the needs of the public and significantly reduce costs and improve performance. Many times, new IT systems are implemented to support these improved business processes. Thus, effective management of IT requirements is critical for ensuring the successful design, development, and delivery of such new systems. These leading practices state that effective business process reengineering and IT requirements management involve, among other things, (1) ensuring strong executive leadership support for process reengineering; (2) assessing the current and target business environment and business performance goals; (3) establishing plans for implementing new business processes; (4) establishing clear, prioritized, and traceable IT requirements; (5) tracking progress in delivering IT requirements; and (6) incorporating input from end user stakeholders. Among these six selected leading practices for reengineering business processes and managing IT requirements, FEMA fully implemented four and partially implemented two of them for its GMM program. For example, the agency ensured strong senior leadership commitment to changing the way it manages its grants, took steps to assess and document its business environment and performance goals, defined initial IT requirements for GMM, took recent actions to better track progress in delivering planned IT requirements, and incorporated input from end user stakeholders. In addition, FEMA had begun planning for business process reengineering; however, it had not finalized plans for transitioning users to the new business processes. Further, while GMM took steps to establish clearly defined and prioritized IT requirements, key requirements were not always traceable. Table 3 summarizes the extent to which FEMA implemented the selected leading practices. According to GAO’s Business Process Reengineering Assessment Guide, the most critical factor for engaging in a reengineering effort is having strong executive leadership support to establish credibility regarding the seriousness of the effort and to maintain the momentum as the agency faces potentially extensive changes to its organizational structure and values. Without such leadership, even the best process design may fail to be accepted and implemented. Agencies should also ensure that there is ongoing executive support (e.g., executive steering committee meetings headed by the agency leader) to oversee the reengineering effort from start to finish. FEMA senior leadership consistently demonstrated its commitment and support for streamlining the agency’s grants management business processes and provided ongoing executive support. For example, one of the Administrator’s top priorities highlighted in FEMA’s 2014 through 2022 strategic plans was to strengthen grants management through innovative systems and business processes to rapidly and effectively deliver the agency’s mission. In accordance with this strategic priority, FEMA initiated GMM with the intent to streamline and modernize grants management across the agency. In addition, FEMA established the Grants Management Executive Steering Group in September 2015. This group is responsible for transforming the agency’s grants management capabilities through its evaluation, prioritization, and oversight of grants management modernization programs, such as GMM. The group’s membership consists of FEMA senior leaders from across the agency’s program and business support areas, such as FEMA regions, Individual Assistance, Public Assistance, Preparedness, Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Office of Chief Counsel, OCIO, and the Office of Policy and Program Analysis. In this group’s ongoing commitment to reengineering grants management processes, it meets monthly to review GMM’s updates, risks, and action items, as well as the program’s budget, schedule, and acquisition activities. For example, the group reviewed the status of key acquisition activities and program milestones, such as the follow-on award for the pilot contractor and the program’s initial operational capability date. The group also reviewed GMM’s program risks, such as data migration challenges (discussed later in this report) and delays in the Agile development contract award. With this continuous executive involvement, FEMA is better positioned to maintain momentum for reengineering the new grants management business processes that the GMM system is intended to support. GAO’s Business Process Reengineering Assessment Guide states that agencies undergoing business process reengineering should develop a common understanding of the current environment by documenting existing core business processes to show how the processes work and how they are interconnected. The agencies should then develop a deeper understanding of the target environment by modeling the workflow of each target business process in enough detail to provide a common understanding of exactly what will be changed and who will be affected by a future solution. Agencies should also assess the performance of their current major business processes to identify problem areas that need to be changed or eliminated and to set realistically achievable, customer- oriented, and measurable business performance improvement goals. FEMA has taken steps to document the current and target grants management business processes. Specifically, The agency took steps to develop a common understanding of its grants management processes by documenting each of the 12 grant categories. For example, in 2016 and 2017, the agency conducted several nationwide user outreach sessions with representatives from FEMA headquarters, the 10 regional offices, and state and local grant recipients to discuss the grant categories and the current grants management business environment. In addition, FEMA’s Office of Chief Counsel developed a Grants Management Manual in January 2018 that outlined the authorizing laws, regulations, and agency policies for all of its grant programs. According to the Grants Management Executive Steering Group, the manual is intended to promote standardized grants management procedures across the agency. Additionally, the group expects grant program and regional offices to assess the manual against their own practices, make updates as needed, and ensure that their staff are properly informed and trained. FEMA also documented target grants management business process workflows for 18 of the 19 business functions that were notionally planned to be developed and deployed in the AFG pilot by December 2018. However, the program experienced delays in developing the AFG pilot (discussed later in this report) and, thus, deferred defining the remaining business function until the program gets closer to developing that function, which is now planned for August 2019. In addition, FEMA established measurable business performance goals for GMM that are aimed at addressing problem areas and improving grants management processes. Specifically, the agency established 14 business performance goals and associated thresholds in an October 2017 acquisition program baseline addendum, as well as 126 performance metrics for all 43 of the target grants management business functions in its March 2017 test and evaluation master plan. According to FEMA, the 14 business performance goals are intended to represent essential outcomes that will indicate whether GMM has successfully met critical, business-focused mission needs. GMM performance goals include areas such as improvements in the satisfaction level of users with GMM compared to the legacy systems and improvements in the timeliness of grant award processing. For example, one of GMM’s goals is to get at least 40 percent of users surveyed to agree or strongly agree that their grants management business processes are easier to accomplish with GMM, compared to the legacy systems. Program officials stated that they plan to work with the Agile development contractor to refine their performance goals and target thresholds, develop a plan for collecting the data and calculating the metrics, and establish a performance baseline with the legacy systems. Program officials also stated that they plan to complete these steps by September 2019—GMM’s initial operational capability date—which is when they are required to begin reporting these metrics to the DHS acquisition review board. According to GAO’s Business Process Reengineering Assessment Guide, agencies undergoing business process reengineering should (1) establish an overall plan to guide the effort (commonly referred to as an organizational change management plan) and (2) provide a common understanding for stakeholders of what to expect and how to plan for process changes. Agencies should develop the plan at the beginning of the reengineering effort and provide specific details on upcoming process changes, such as critical milestones and deliverables for an orderly transition, roles and responsibilities for change management activities, reengineering goals, skills and resource needs, key barriers to change, communication expectations, training, and any staff redeployments or reductions-in-force. The agency should develop and begin implementing its change management plan ahead of introducing new processes to ensure sufficient support among stakeholders for the reengineered processes. While FEMA has begun planning its business process reengineering activities, it has not finalized its plans or established time frames for their completion. Specifically, as of September 2018, program officials were in the process of drafting an organizational change management plan that is intended to establish an approach for preparing grants management stakeholders for upcoming changes. According to FEMA, this document is intended to help avoid uncertainty and confusion among stakeholders as changes are made to the agency’s grant programs, and ensure successful adoption of new business processes, strategies, and technologies. As discussed previously in this report, the transition to GMM will involve changes to FEMA’s disparate grants management processes that are managed by many different stakeholders across the agency. Program officials acknowledged that change management is the biggest challenge they face in implementing GMM and said they had begun taking several actions intended to support the agency’s change management activities. For example, program officials reported in October 2018 that they had recently created an executive-level working group intended to address FEMA’s policy challenges related to the standardization of grants management processes. Additionally, program officials reported that they planned to: (1) hire additional support staff focused on coordinating grants change management activities; and (2) pursue regional office outreach to encourage broad support among GMM’s decentralized stakeholders, such as state, local, and tribal territories. However, despite these actions, the officials were unable to provide time frames for completing the organizational change management plan or the additional actions. Until the plan and actions are complete, the program lacks assurance that it will have sufficient support among stakeholders for the reengineered processes. In addition, GMM did not establish plans and time frames for the activities that needed to take place prior to, during, and after the transition from the legacy AFG to GMM. Instead, program officials stated that they had worked collaboratively with the legacy AFG program and planned these details informally by discussing them in various communications, such as emails and meetings. However, this informal planning approach is not a repeatable process, which is essential to this program as FEMA plans to transition many sets of functionality to many different users during the lifecycle of this program. Program officials acknowledged that for future transitions they will need more repeatable transition planning and stated that they intend to establish such plans, but did not provide a time frame for when such changes would be made. Until FEMA develops a repeatable process, with established time frames for communicating the transition details to its customers prior to each transition, the agency risks that the transition from the legacy systems to GMM will not occur as intended. It also increases its risk that stakeholders will not support the implementation of reengineered grants management processes. Leading practices for software development efforts state that IT requirements are to be clearly defined and prioritized. This includes, among other things, maintaining bidirectional traceability as the requirements evolve, to ensure there are no inconsistencies among program plans and requirements. In addition, programs using Agile software development are to maintain a product vision, or roadmap, to guide the planning of major program milestones and provide a high-level view of planned requirements. Programs should also maintain a prioritized list (referred to as a backlog) of narrowly defined requirements (referred to as lower-level requirements) that are to be delivered. Programs should maintain this backlog with the product owner to ensure the program is always working on the highest priority requirements that will deliver the most value to the users. The GMM program established clearly defined and prioritized requirements and maintained bidirectional traceability among the various levels of requirements: Grant lifecycle phases: In its Concept of Operations document, the program established six grants management lifecycle phases that represent the highest level of GMM’s requirements, through which it derives lower-level requirements. Business functions: The Concept of Operations document also identifies the next level of GMM requirements—the 43 business functions that describe how FEMA officials, grant recipients, and other stakeholders are to manage grants. According to program officials, the 43 business functions are to be refined, prioritized, and delivered to GMM customers iteratively. Further, for the AFG pilot, the GMM program office prioritized 19 business functions with the product owner and planned the development of these functions in a roadmap. Epics: GMM’s business functions are decomposed into epics, which represent smaller portions of functionality that can be developed over multiple increments. According to program officials, GMM intends to develop, refine, and prioritize the epics iteratively. As of August 2018, the program had developed 67 epics in the program backlog. An example of one of the epics for the AFG pilot is to prepare and submit grant closeout materials. User stories: The epics are decomposed into user stories, which convey the customers’ requirements at the smallest and most discrete unit of work that must be done within a single sprint to create working software. GMM develops, refines, and prioritizes the user stories iteratively. As of August 2018, the program had developed 1,118 user stories in the backlog. An example of a user story is “As an external user, I can log in with a username and password.” Figure 6 provides an example of how GMM’s different levels of requirements are decomposed. Nevertheless, while we found requirements to be traceable at the sprint- level (i.e., epics and user stories), traceability of requirements at the increment-level (i.e., business functions) were inconsistent among different requirements planning documents. Specifically, the capabilities and constraints document shows that five business functions are planned to be developed within sub-increment 1A, whereas the other key planning document—the roadmap for the AFG pilot—showed one of those five functions as being planned for the sub-increment 1B. In addition, the capabilities and constraints document shows that nine business functions are planned to be developed within sub-increment 1B, but the roadmap showed one of those nine functions as being planned for the sub- increment 1C. Program officials stated that they decided to defer these functions to later sub-increments due to unexpected technical difficulties encountered when developing functionality and reprioritizing functions with the product owners. While the officials updated the roadmap to reflect the deferred functionality, they did not update the capabilities and constraints document to maintain traceability between these two important requirements planning documents. Program officials stated that they learned during the AFG pilot that the use of a capabilities and constraints document for increment-level scope planning was not ideal and that they intended to change the process for how they documented planned requirements for future increments. However, program officials did not provide a time frame for when this change would be made. Until the program makes this change and then ensures it maintains traceability of increment-level requirements between requirements planning documents, it will continue to risk confusion among stakeholders about what is to be delivered. In addition, until recently, GMM’s planning documents were missing up- to-date information regarding when most of the legacy systems will be transitioned to GMM. Specifically, while the program’s planning documents (including the GMM roadmap) provided key milestones for the entire lifecycle of the program and high-level capabilities to be delivered in the AFG pilot, these documents lacked up-to-date time frames for when FEMA planned to transition the nine remaining legacy systems. For example, in May 2017, GMM drafted notional time frames for transitioning the legacy systems, including plans for AFG to be the seventh system replaced by GMM. However, in December 2017, the program decided to reprioritize the legacy systems so that AFG would be replaced first—yet this major change was not reflected in the program’s roadmap. Moreover, while AFG program officials were informed of the decision to transition the AFG program first, in June 2018 officials from other grant programs told us that they had not been informed on when their systems were to be replaced. As a result, these programs were uncertain about when they should start planning for their respective transitions. In August 2018, GMM program officials acknowledged that they were delayed in deciding the sequencing order for the legacy system transitions. Program officials stated that the delay was due to their need to factor the Agile development contractor’s perspective into these decisions; yet, at that time, the contract award had been delayed by approximately 8 months. Subsequently, in October 2018, program officials identified tentative time frames for transitioning the remaining legacy systems. Program officials stated that they determined the tentative time frames for transitioning the legacy systems based on key factors, such as mission need, cost, security vulnerabilities, and technical obsolescence, and that they had shared these new time frames with grant program officials. The officials also stated that, once the Agile contractor begins contract performance, they expect to be able to validate the contractor’s capacity and finalize these time frames by obtaining approval from the Grants Management Executive Steering Group. By taking steps to update and communicate these important time frames, FEMA should be better positioned to ensure that each of the grant programs are prepared for transitioning to GMM. According to leading practices, Agile programs should track their progress in delivering planned IT requirements within a sprint (i.e., short iterations that produce working software). Given that sprints are very short cycles of development (e.g., 2 weeks), the efficiency of completing planned work within a sprint relies on a disciplined approach that includes using a fixed pace, referred to as the sprint cadence, that provides a consistent and predictable development routine. A disciplined approach also includes identifying by the start of a sprint which user stories will be developed, developing those stories to completion (e.g., fully tested and demonstrated to, and accepted by, the product owner), and tracking completion progress of those stories. Progress should be communicated to relevant stakeholders and used by the development teams to better understand their capacity to develop stories, continuously improve on their processes, and forecast how long it will take to deliver all remaining capabilities. The GMM program did not effectively track progress in delivering IT requirements during the first nine sprints, which occurred from January to June 2018. These gaps in tracking the progress of requirements, in part, had an impact on the program’s progress in delivering the 19 AFG business functions that were originally planned by December 2018 and are now deferred to August 2019. However, beginning in July 2018, in response to our ongoing review, the program took steps to improve in these areas. Specifically, GMM did not communicate the status of its Agile development progress to program stakeholders, such as the grant programs, the regional offices, and the development teams, during most of the first nine sprints. Program officials acknowledged that they should use metrics to track development progress and, in July 2018, they began reporting metrics to program stakeholders. For example, they began collecting and providing data on the number of stories planned and delivered, estimated capacity for development teams, and the number of days spent working on the sprint, as part of the program’s weekly status reports to program stakeholders, such as product owners. Rather than using a fixed, predictable sprint cadence, GMM allowed a variable development cadence, meaning that sprint durations varied from 1 to 4 weeks throughout the first nine sprints. Program officials noted that they had experimented with the use of a variable cadence to allow more time to complete complex technical work. Program officials stated that they realized that varying the sprints was not effective and, in July 2018 for sprint 10, they reverted back to a fixed, 2 week cadence. GMM added a significant amount of scope during its first nine sprints, after the development work had already begun. For example, the program committed to 28 user stories at the beginning of sprint eight, and then nearly doubled the work by adding 25 additional stories in the middle of the sprint. Program officials cited multiple reasons for adding more stories, including that an insufficient number of stories had been defined in the backlog when the sprint began, the realization that planned stories were too large and needed to be decomposed into smaller stories, and the realization that other work would be needed in addition to what was originally planned. Program officials recognized that, by the start of a sprint, the requirements should be sufficiently defined, such that they are ready for development without requiring major changes during the sprint. The program made recent improvements in sprints 11 and 12, which had only five stories added after the start of a sprint. By taking these steps to establish consistency among sprints, the program has better positioned itself to more effectively monitor and manage the remaining IT development work. In addition, this improvement in consistency should help the program avoid future deferments of functionality. Leading practices state that programs should regularly collaborate with, and collect input from, relevant stakeholders; monitor the status of stakeholder involvement; incorporate stakeholder input; and measure how well stakeholders’ needs are being met. For Agile programs, it is especially important to track user satisfaction to determine how well the program has met stakeholders’ needs. Consistent stakeholder participation ensures that the program meets its stakeholders’ needs. FEMA implemented its responsibilities in this area through several means, such as stakeholder outreach activities; development of a strategic communications plan; and continuous monitoring, solicitation, and recording of stakeholder involvement and feedback. For example, the agency conducted nationwide outreach sessions from January 2016 through August 2017 and began conducting additional outreach sessions in April 2018. These outreach sessions involved hundreds of representatives from FEMA headquarters, the 10 regional offices, and state and local grant recipients to collect information on the current grants management environment and opportunities for streamlining grants management processes. FEMA also held oversight and stakeholder outreach activities and actively solicited and recorded feedback from its stakeholders on a regular basis. For example, GMM regularly verified with users that the new functionality met their IT requirements, as part of the Agile development cycle. Additionally, we observed several GMM biweekly requirements validation sessions where the program’s stakeholders were involved and provided feedback as part of the requirements development and refinement process. In addition, FEMA identified GMM stakeholders and tracked its engagement with these stakeholders using a stakeholder register. The agency also defined processes for how the GMM program is to collaborate with its stakeholders in a stakeholder communication plan and Agile development team agreement. Also, while several officials from the selected grant program and regional offices that we interviewed indicated that the program could improve in communicating its plans for GMM and incorporating stakeholder input, most of the representatives from these offices stated that GMM is doing well at interacting with its stakeholders. Finally, in October 2018, program officials reported that they had recently begun measuring user satisfaction by conducting surveys and interviews with users that have utilized the new functionality within GMM. The program’s outreach activities, collection of stakeholder input, and measurement of user satisfaction demonstrate that the program is taking the appropriate steps to incorporate stakeholder input. Reliable cost estimates are critical for successfully delivering IT programs. Such estimates provide the basis for informed decision making, realistic budget formulation, meaningful progress measurement, and accountability for results. GAO’s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide defines leading practices related to the following four characteristics of a high-quality, reliable estimate. Comprehensive. The estimate accounts for all possible costs associated with a program, is structured in sufficient detail to ensure that costs are neither omitted nor double counted, and documents all cost-influencing assumptions. Well-documented. Supporting documentation explains the process, sources, and methods used to create the estimate; contains the underlying data used to develop the estimate; and is adequately reviewed and approved by management. Accurate. The estimate is not overly conservative or optimistic, is based on an assessment of the costs most likely to be incurred, and is regularly updated so that it always reflects the program’s current status. Credible. Discusses any limitations of the analysis because of uncertainty or sensitivity surrounding data or assumptions, the estimate’s results are cross-checked, and an independent cost estimate is conducted by a group outside the acquiring organization to determine whether other estimating methods produce similar results. In May 2017, DHS approved GMM’s lifecycle cost estimate of about $251 million for fiscal years 2015 through 2030. We found this initial estimate to be reliable because it fully or substantially addressed all the characteristics associated with a reliable cost estimate. For example, the estimate comprehensively included government and contractor costs, all elements of the program’s work breakdown structure, and all phases of the system lifecycle; and was aligned with the program’s technical documentation at the time the estimate was developed. GMM also fully documented the key assumptions, data sources, estimating methodology, and calculations for the estimate. Further, the program conducted a risk assessment and sensitivity analysis, and DHS conducted an independent assessment of the cost estimate to validate the accuracy and credibility of the cost estimate. However, key assumptions that FEMA made about the program changed soon after DHS approved the cost estimate in May 2017. Thus, the initial cost estimate no longer reflects the current approach for the program. For example, key assumptions about the program that changed include: Change in the technical approach: The initial cost estimate assumed that GMM would implement a software-as-a-service model, meaning that FEMA would rely on a service provider to deliver software applications and the underlying infrastructure to run them. However, in December 2017, the program instead decided to implement an infrastructure-as-a-service model, meaning that FEMA would develop and deploy its own software application and rely on a service provider to deliver and manage the computing infrastructure (e.g., servers, software, storage, and network equipment). According to program officials, this decision was made after learning from the Agile prototypes that the infrastructure-as-a-service model would allow GMM to develop the system in a more flexible environment. Increase in the number of system development personnel: A key factor with Agile development is the number of development teams (each consisting of experts in software development, testing, and cybersecurity) that are operating concurrently and producing separate portions of software functionality. Program officials initially assumed that they would need three to four concurrent Agile development teams, but subsequently realized that they would instead need to expend more resources to achieve GMM’s original completion date. Specifically, program officials now expect they will need to at least double, and potentially triple, the number of concurrent development teams to meet GMM’s original target dates. Significant delays and complexities with data migration: In 2016 and 2017, GMM experienced various technical challenges in its effort to transfer legacy system data to a data staging platform. This data transfer effort needed to be done to standardize the data before eventually migrating the data to GMM. These challenges resulted in significant delays and cost increases. Program officials reported that, by February 2018—at least 9 months later than planned—all legacy data had been transferred to a data staging platform so that FEMA officials could begin analyzing and standardizing the data prior to migrating it into GMM. FEMA officials reported that they anticipated the cost estimate to increase, and for this increase to be high enough to breach the $251 million threshold set in GMM’s May 2017 acquisition program baseline. Thus, consistent with DHS’s acquisition guidance, the program informed the DHS acquisition review board of this anticipated breach. The board declared that the program was in a cost breach status, as of September 12, 2018. As of October 2018, program officials stated that they were in the process of revising the cost estimate to reflect the changes in the program and to incorporate actual costs. In addition, the officials stated that the program was applying a new cost estimating methodology tailored for Agile programs that DHS’s Cost Analysis Division had been developing. In December 2018, program officials stated that they had completed the revised cost estimate but it was still undergoing departmental approval. Establishing an updated cost estimate should help FEMA better understand the expected costs to deliver GMM under the program’s current approach and time frames. The success of an IT program depends, in part, on having an integrated and reliable master schedule that defines when the program’s set of work activities and milestone events are to occur, how long they will take, and how they are related to one another. Among other things, a reliable schedule provides a roadmap for systematic execution of an IT program and the means by which to gauge progress, identify and address potential problems, and promote accountability. GAO’s Schedule Assessment Guide defines leading practices related to the following four characteristics that are vital to having a reliable integrated master schedule. Comprehensive. A comprehensive schedule reflects all activities for both the government and its contractors that are necessary to accomplish a program’s objectives, as defined in the program’s work breakdown structure. The schedule also includes the labor, materials, and overhead needed to do the work and depicts when those resources are needed and when they will be available. It realistically reflects how long each activity will take and allows for discrete progress measurement. Well-constructed. A schedule is well-constructed if all of its activities are logically sequenced with the most straightforward logic possible. Unusual or complicated logic techniques are used judiciously and justified in the schedule documentation. The schedule’s critical path represents a true model of the activities that drive the program’s earliest completion date and total float accurately depicts schedule flexibility. Credible. A schedule that is credible is horizontally traceable—that is, it reflects the order of events necessary to achieve aggregated products or outcomes. It is also vertically traceable—that is, activities in varying levels of the schedule map to one another and key dates presented to management in periodic briefings are consistent with the schedule. Data about risks are used to predict a level of confidence in meeting the program’s completion date. The level of necessary schedule contingency and high-priority risks are identified by conducting a robust schedule risk analysis. Controlled. A schedule is controlled if it is updated regularly by trained schedulers using actual progress and logic to realistically forecast dates for program activities. It is compared to a designated baseline schedule to measure, monitor, and report the program’s progress. The baseline schedule is accompanied by a baseline document that explains the overall approach to the program, defines ground rules and assumptions, and describes the unique features of the schedule. The baseline schedule and current schedule are subject to a configuration management control process. GMM’s schedule was unreliable because it minimally addressed three characteristics—comprehensive, credible, and controlled—and did not address the fourth characteristic of a reliable estimate—well-constructed. One of the most significant issues was that the program’s fast approaching, final delivery date of September 2020 was not informed by a realistic assessment of GMM development activities, and rather was determined by imposing an unsubstantiated delivery date. Table 4 summarizes our assessment of GMM’s schedule. In discussing the reasons for the shortfalls in these practices, program officials stated that they had been uncertain about the level of rigor that should be applied to the GMM schedule, given their use of Agile development. However, leading practices state that program schedules should meet all the scheduling practices, regardless of whether a program is using Agile development. As discussed earlier in this report, GMM has already experienced significant schedule delays. For example, the legacy data migration effort, the AFG pilot, and the Agile development contract have been delayed. Program officials also stated that the delay in awarding and starting the Agile contract has delayed other important activities, such as establishing time frames for transitioning legacy systems. A more robust schedule could have helped FEMA predict the impact of delays on remaining activities and identify which activities appeared most critical so that the program could ensure that any risks in delaying those activities were properly mitigated. In response to our review and findings, program officials recognized the need to continually enhance their schedule practices to improve the management and communication of program activities. As a result, in August 2018, the officials stated that they planned to add a master scheduler to the team to improve the program’s schedule practices and ensure that all of the areas of concern we identified are adequately addressed. In October 2018, the officials reported that they had recently added two master schedulers to GMM. According to the statement of objectives, the Agile contractor is expected to develop an integrated master schedule soon after it begins performance. However, program officials stated that GMM is schedule-driven—due to the Executive Steering Group’s expectation that the solution will be delivered by September 2020. The officials added that, if GMM encounters challenges in meeting this time frame, the program plans to seek additional resources to allow it to meet the 2020 target. GMM’s schedule-driven approach has already led to an increase in estimated costs and resources. For example, as previously mentioned, the program has determined that, to meet its original target dates, GMM needs to at least double, and possibly triple, the number of concurrent Agile development teams. In addition, we have previously reported that schedule pressure on federal IT programs can lead to omissions and skipping of key activities, especially system testing. In August 2018, program officials acknowledged that September 2020 may not be feasible and that the overall completion time frames established in the acquisition program baseline may eventually need to be rebaselined. Without a robust schedule to forecast whether FEMA’s aggressive delivery goal for GMM is realistic to achieve, leadership will be limited in its ability to make informed decisions on what additional increases in cost or reductions in scope might be needed to fully deliver the system. NIST’s risk management framework establishes standards and guidelines for agencies to follow in developing cybersecurity programs. Agencies are expected to use this framework to achieve more secure information and information systems through the implementation of appropriate risk mitigation strategies and by performing activities that ensure that necessary security controls are integrated into agencies’ processes. The framework addresses broad cybersecurity and risk management activities, which include the following: Categorize the system: Programs are to categorize systems by identifying the types of information used, selecting a potential impact level (e.g., low, moderate, or high), and assigning a category based on the highest level of impact to the system’s confidentiality, integrity, and availability, if the system was compromised. Programs are also to document a description of the information system and its boundaries and should register the system with appropriate program management offices. System categorization is documented in a system security plan. Select and implement security controls: Programs are to determine protective measures, or security controls, to be implemented based on the system categorization results. These security controls are documented in a system security plan. For example, control areas include access controls, incident response, security assessment and authorization, identification and authentication, and configuration management. Once controls are identified, programs are to determine planned implementation actions for each of the designated controls. These implementation actions are also specified in the system security plan. Assess security controls: Programs are to develop, review, and approve a security assessment plan. The purpose of the security assessment plan approval is to establish the appropriate expectations for the security control assessment. Programs are to also perform a security control assessment by evaluating the security controls in accordance with the procedures defined in the security assessment plan, in order to determine the extent to which the controls were implemented correctly. The output of this process is intended to produce a security assessment report to document the issues, findings, and recommendations. Programs are to conduct initial remediation actions on security controls and reassess those security controls, as appropriate. Obtain an authorization to operate the system: Programs are to obtain security authorization approval in order to operate a system. Resolving weaknesses and vulnerabilities identified during testing is an important step leading up to achieving an authorization to operate. Programs are to establish corrective action plans to address any deficiencies in cybersecurity policies, procedures, and practices. DHS guidance also states that corrective action plans must be developed for every weakness identified during a security control assessment and within a security assessment report. Monitor security controls on an ongoing basis: Programs are to monitor their security controls on an ongoing basis after deployment, including determining the security impact of proposed or actual changes to the information system and assessing the security controls in accordance with a monitoring strategy that determines the frequency of monitoring the controls. For the GMM program’s engineering and test environment, which went live in February 2018, FEMA fully addressed three of the five key cybersecurity practices in NIST’s risk management framework and partially addressed two of the practices. Specifically, FEMA categorized GMM’s environment based on security risk, implemented select security controls, and monitored security controls on an ongoing basis. However, the agency partially addressed the areas of assessing security controls and obtaining an authorization to operate the system. Table 5 provides a summary of the extent to which FEMA addressed NIST’s key cybersecurity practices for GMM’s engineering and test environment. Consistent with NIST’s framework, GMM categorized the security risk of its engineering and test environment and identified it as a moderate- impact environment. A moderate-impact environment is one where the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a serious or adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. GMM completed the following steps leading to this categorization: The program documented in its System Security Plan the various types of data and information that the environment will collect, process, and store, such as conducting technology research, building or enhancing technology, and maintaining IT networks. The program established three information types and assigned security levels of low, moderate, or high impact in the areas of confidentiality, availability, and integrity. A low-impact security level was assigned to two information types: (1) conducting technology research and (2) building or enhancing technology; and a moderate- impact security level was assigned to the third information type: maintaining IT networks. The engineering and test environment was categorized as an overall moderate-impact system, based on the highest security impact level assignment. GMM documented a description of the environment, including a diagram depicting the system’s boundaries, which illustrates, among other things, databases and firewalls. GMM properly registered its engineering and test environment with FEMA’s Chief Information Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and acting Chief Information Security Officer. By conducting the security categorization process, GMM has taken steps that should ensure that the appropriate security controls are selected for the program’s engineering and test environment. Consistent with NIST’s framework and the system categorization results, GMM appropriately determined which security controls to implement and planned actions for implementing those controls in its System Security Plan for the engineering and test environment. For example, the program utilized NIST guidance to select standard controls for a system categorized with a moderate-impact security level. These control areas include, for example, access controls, risk assessment, incident response, identification and authentication, and configuration management. Further, the program documented its planned actions to implement each control in its System Security Plan. For example, GMM documented that the program plans to implement its Incident Response Testing control by participating in an agency-wide exercise and unannounced vulnerability scans. As another example, GMM documented that the program plans to implement its Contingency Plan Testing control by testing the contingency plan annually, reviewing the test results, and preparing after action reports. By selecting and planning for the implementation of security controls, GMM has taken steps to mitigate its security risks and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information system. Consistent with NIST’s framework, in January 2018, GMM program officials developed a security assessment plan for the engineering and test environment. According to GMM program officials, this plan was reviewed by the security assessment team. However, the security assessment plan lacked essential details. Specifically, while the plan included the general process for evaluating the environment’s security controls, the planned assessment procedures for all 964 security controls were not sufficiently defined. Specifically, GMM program officials copied example assessment procedures from NIST guidance and inserted them into its security assessment documentation for all of its 964 controls, without making further adjustments to explain the steps that should be taken specific to GMM. Table 6 shows an example of a security assessment procedure copied from the NIST guidance that should have been further adjusted for GMM. In addition, the actual assessment procedures that the GMM assessors used to evaluate the security controls were not documented. Instead, the program only documented whether each control passed or failed each test. GMM program officials stated that the planned assessment procedures are based on an agency template that was exported from a DHS compliance tool, and that FEMA security officials have been instructed by the DHS OCIO not to tailor or make any adjustments to the template language. However, the assessment procedures outlined in NIST’s guidance are to serve as a starting point for organizations preparing their program specific assessments. According to NIST, organizations are expected to select and tailor their assessment procedures for each security control from NIST’s list of suggested assessment options (e.g., review, analyze, or inspect policies, procedures, and related documentation options). DHS OCIO officials stated that, consistent with NIST’s guidance, they expect that components will ensure they are in compliance with the minimum standards and will also add details and additional rigor, as appropriate, to tailor the planned security assessment procedures to fit their unique missions or needs. In November 2018, in response to our audit, DHS OCIO officials stated that they were meeting with FEMA OCIO officials to understand why they did not document the planned and actual assessment procedures performed by the assessors for GMM. Until FEMA ensures that detailed planned evaluation methods and actual evaluation procedures specific to GMM are defined, the program risks assessing security controls incorrectly, having controls that do not work as intended, and producing undesirable outcomes with respect to meeting the security requirements. In addition, the security assessment plan was not approved by FEMA’s OCIO before proceeding with the security assessment. Program officials stated that approval was not required for the security assessment plan prior to the development of the security assessment report. However, NIST guidance states that the purpose of the security assessment plan approval is to establish the appropriate expectations for the security control assessment. By not getting the security assessment plan approved by FEMA’s OCIO before security assessment reviews were conducted, GMM risks inconsistencies with the plan and security objectives of the organization. Finally, consistent with NIST guidance, GMM performed a security assessment in December 2017 of the engineering and test environment’s controls, which identified 36 vulnerabilities (23 critical- and high-impact vulnerabilities and 13 medium- and low-impact vulnerabilities). The program also documented these vulnerabilities and associated findings and recommendations in a security assessment report. GMM conducted initial remediation actions (i.e., remediation of vulnerabilities that should be corrected immediately) for 12 of the critical- and high-impact vulnerabilities and a reassessment of those security controls confirmed that they were resolved by January 2018. Remediation of the remaining 11 critical- and high-impact vulnerabilities and 13 medium- and low- impact vulnerabilities were to be addressed by corrective action plans as part of the authorization to operate process, which is discussed in the next section. The authorization to operate GMM’s engineering and test environment was granted on February 5, 2018. Among other things, this decision was based on the important stipulation that the remaining 11 critical- and high- impact vulnerabilities associated with multifactor authentication would be addressed within 45 days, or by March 22, 2018. However, the program did not meet this deadline and, instead, approximately 2 months after this deadline passed, obtained a waiver to remediate these vulnerabilities by May 9, 2019. These vulnerabilities are related to a multifactor authentication capability. Program officials stated that they worked with FEMA OCIO officials to attempt to address these vulnerabilities by the initial deadline, but they were unsuccessful in finding a viable solution. Therefore, GMM program officials developed a waiver at the recommendation of the OCIO to provide additional time to develop a viable solution. However, a multifactor authentication capability is essential to ensuring that users are who they say they are, prior to granting users access to the GMM engineering and test environment, in order to reduce the risk of harmful actors accessing the system. In addition, as of September 2018, the program had not established corrective action plans for the 13 medium- and low-impact vulnerabilities. Program officials stated that they do not typically address low-impact vulnerabilities; however, this is in conflict with DHS guidance that specifies that corrective action plans must be developed for every weakness identified during a security control assessment and within a security assessment report. In response to our audit, in October 2018, GMM program officials developed these remaining corrective action plans. The plans indicated that these vulnerabilities were to be fully addressed by January 2019 and April 2019. While the program eventually took corrective actions in response to our audit by developing the missing plans, the GMM program initially failed to follow DHS’s guidance on preparing corrective actions plans for all security vulnerabilities. Until GMM consistently follows DHS’s guidance, it will be difficult for FEMA to determine the extent to which GMM’s security weaknesses identified during its security control assessments are remediated. Additionally, as we have reported at other agencies, vulnerabilities can be indicators of more significant underlying issues and, thus, without appropriate management attention or prompt remediation, GMM is at risk of unnecessarily exposing the program to potential exploits. Moreover, GMM was required to assess all untested controls by March 7, 2018, or no later than 30 days after the approval of the authorization to operate; however, it did not meet this deadline. Specifically, we found that, by October 2018, FEMA had not fully tested 190 security controls in the GMM engineering and test environment. These controls were related to areas such as security incident handling and allocation of resources required to protect an information system. In response to our findings, in October 2018, GMM program officials reported that they had since fully tested 27 controls and partially tested the remaining 163 controls. Program officials stated that testing of the 163 controls is a shared responsibility between GMM and other parties (e.g., the cloud service provider). They added that GMM had completed its portion of the testing but was in the process of verifying the completion of testing by other parties. Program officials stated that the untested controls were not addressed sooner, in part, because of errors resulting from configuration changes in the program’s compliance tool during a system upgrade, which have now been resolved. Until GMM ensures that all security controls have been tested, it remains at an increased risk of exposing programs to potential exploits. Consistent with the NIST framework, GMM established methods for assessing and monitoring security controls to be conducted after an authorization to operate has been approved. GMM has tailored its cybersecurity policies and practices for monitoring its controls to take into account the frequent and iterative pace with which system functionality is continuously being introduced into the GMM environment. Specifically, the GMM program established a process for assessing security impact changes to the system and conducting reauthorizations to operate within the rapid Agile delivery environment. As part of this process, GMM embedded cybersecurity experts on each Agile development team so that they are involved early and can impact security considerations from the beginning of requirements development through testing and deployment of system functionality. In addition, the process involves important steps for ensuring that the system moves from development to completion, while producing a secure and reliable system. For example, it includes procedures for creating, reviewing, and testing new system functionality. As the new system functionality is integrated with existing system functionality, it is to undergo automated testing and security scans in order to ensure that the integrity of the security of the system has not been compromised. Further, an automated process is to deploy the code if it passes all security scans, code tests, and code quality checks. GMM’s process for conducting a reauthorization to operate within the rapid delivery Agile development environment is to follow FEMA guidance that states that all high-level changes made to a FEMA IT system must receive approval from both a change advisory board and the FEMA Chief Information Officer. The board and FEMA Chief Information Officer are to focus their review and approval on scheduled releases and epics (i.e., collections of user stories). Additionally, the Information System Security Officer is to review each planned user story and, if it is determined that the proposed changes may impact the integrity of the authorization, the Information System Security Officer is to work with the development team to begin the process of updating the system authorization. Finally, GMM uses automated tools to track the frequency in which security controls are assessed and to ensure that required scanning data are received by FEMA for reporting purposes. Program officials stated that, in the absence of department-level and agency-level guidance, they have coordinated with DHS and FEMA OCIO officials to ensure that these officials are in agreement with GMM’s approach to continuous monitoring. By having monitoring control policies and procedures in place, FEMA management is positioned to more effectively prioritize and plan its risk response to current threats and vulnerabilities for the GMM program. Given FEMA’s highly complex grants management environment, with its many stakeholders, IT systems, and internal and external users, implementing leading practices for business process reengineering and IT requirements management is critical for success. FEMA has taken many positive steps, including ensuring executive leadership support for business process reengineering, documenting the agency’s grants management processes and performance improvement goals, defining initial IT requirements for the program, incorporating input from end user stakeholders into the development and implementation process, and taking recent actions to improve its delivery of planned IT requirements. Nevertheless, until the GMM program finalizes plans and time frames for implementing its organizational change management actions, plans and communicates system transition activities, and maintains clear traceability of IT requirements, FEMA will be limited in its ability to provide streamlined grants management processes and effectively deliver a modernized IT system to meet the needs of its large range of users. While GMM’s initial cost estimate was reliable, key assumptions about the program since the initial estimate had changed and, therefore, it no longer reflected the current approach for the program. The forthcoming updated cost schedule is expected to better reflect the current approach. However, the program’s unreliable schedule to fully deliver GMM by September 2020 is aggressive and unrealistic. The delays the program has experienced to date further compound GMM’s schedule issues. Without a robust schedule that has been informed by a realistic assessment of GMM’s development activities, leadership will be limited in its ability to make informed decisions on what additional increases in cost or reductions in scope might be needed to achieve their goals. Further, FEMA’s implementation of cybersecurity practices for GMM in the areas of system categorization, selection and implementation, and monitoring will help the program. However, GMM lacked essential details for evaluating security controls, did not approve the security assessment plan before proceeding with the security assessment, did not follow DHS’s guidance to develop corrective action plans for all security vulnerabilities, and did not fully test all security controls. As a result, the GMM engineering and test environment remains at an increased risk of exploitations. We are making eight recommendations to FEMA: The FEMA Administrator should ensure that the GMM program management office finalizes the organizational change management plan and time frames for implementing change management actions. (Recommendation 1) The FEMA Administrator should ensure that the GMM program management office plans and communicates its detailed transition activities to its affected customers before they transition to GMM and undergo significant changes to their processes. (Recommendation 2) The FEMA Administrator should ensure that the GMM program management office implements its planned changes to its processes for documenting requirements for future increments and ensures it maintains traceability among key IT requirements documents. (Recommendation 3) The FEMA Administrator should ensure that the GMM program management office updates the program schedule to address the leading practices for a reliable schedule identified in this report. (Recommendation 4) The FEMA Administrator should ensure that the FEMA OCIO defines sufficiently detailed planned evaluation methods and actual evaluation methods for assessing security controls. (Recommendation 5) The FEMA Administrator should ensure that the FEMA OCIO approves a security assessment plan before security assessment reviews are conducted. (Recommendation 6) The FEMA Administrator should ensure that the GMM program management office follows DHS guidance on preparing corrective action plans for all security vulnerabilities. (Recommendation 7) The FEMA Administrator should ensure that the GMM program management office fully tests all of its security controls for the system. (Recommendation 8) DHS provided written comments on a draft of this report, which are reprinted in appendix IV. In its comments, the department concurred with all eight of our recommendations and provided estimated completion dates for implementing each of them. For example, with regard to recommendation 4, the department stated that FEMA plans to update the GMM program schedule to address the leading practices for a reliable schedule by April 30, 2019. In addition, for recommendation 7, the department stated that FEMA plans to ensure that corrective action plans are prepared by July 31, 2019, to address all identified security vulnerabilities for GMM. If implemented effectively, the actions that FEMA plans to take in response to the recommendations should address the weaknesses we identified. We also received technical comments from DHS and FEMA officials, which we incorporated, as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Homeland Security and interested congressional committees. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-4456 or harriscc@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix V. Our objectives were to (1) determine the extent to which the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is implementing leading practices for reengineering its grants management business processes and incorporating business needs into Grants Management Modernization (GMM) information technology (IT) requirements; (2) assess the reliability of the program’s estimated costs and schedule; and (3) determine the extent to which FEMA is addressing key cybersecurity practices for GMM. To address the first objective, we reviewed GAO’s Business Process Reengineering Assessment Guide and Software Engineering Institute’s Capability Maturity Model for Integration for Development to identify practices associated with business process reengineering and IT requirements management. We then selected six areas that, in our professional judgment, represented foundational practices that were of particular importance to the successful implementation of an IT modernization effort that is using Agile development processes. We also selected the practices that were most relevant based on where GMM was in the system development lifecycle and we discussed the practice areas with FEMA officials. The practices are: Ensuring executive leadership support for process reengineering Assessing the current and target business environment and business Establishing plans for implementing new business processes Establishing clear, prioritized, and traceable IT requirements Tracking progress in delivering IT requirements Incorporating input from end user stakeholders We also reviewed selected chapters of GAO’s draft Agile Assessment Guide (Version 6A), which is intended to establish a consistent framework based on best practices that can be used across the federal government for developing, implementing, managing, and evaluating agencies’ IT investments that rely on Agile methods. To develop this guide, GAO worked closely with Agile experts in the public and private sector; some chapters of the guide are considered more mature because they have been reviewed by the expert panel. We reviewed these chapters to ensure that our expectations for how FEMA should apply the six practices for business process reengineering and IT requirements management are appropriate for an Agile program and are consistent with the draft guidance that is under development. Additionally, since Agile development programs may use different terminology to describe their software development processes, the Agile terms used in this report (e.g., increment, sprint, epic, etc.) are specific to the GMM program. We obtained and analyzed FEMA grants management modernization documentation, such as current and target grants management business processes, acquisition program baseline, operational requirements document, concept of operations, requirements analyses workbooks, Grants Management Executive Steering Group artifacts, stakeholder outreach artifacts, Agile increment- and sprint-level planning and development artifacts, and the requirements backlog. We assessed the program documentation against the selected practices to determine the extent to which the agency had implemented them. We then assessed each practice area as: fully implemented—FEMA provided complete evidence that showed it fully implemented the practice area; partially implemented—FEMA provided evidence that showed it partially implemented the practice area; not implemented—FEMA did not provide evidence that showed it implemented any of the practice area. Additionally, we observed Agile increment and sprint development activities at GMM facilities in Washington, D.C. We also observed a demonstration of how the program manages its lower level requirements (i.e., user stories and epics) and maintains traceability of the requirements using an automated tool at GMM facilities in Washington, D.C. We also interviewed FEMA officials, including the GMM Program Executive, GMM Program Manager, GMM Business Transformation Team Lead, and Product Owner regarding their efforts to streamline grants management business processes, collect and incorporate stakeholder input, and manage GMM’s requirements. In addition, we interviewed FEMA officials from four out of 16 grant program offices and two out of 10 regional offices to obtain contextual information and illustrative examples of FEMA’s efforts to reengineer grants management business processes and collect business requirements for GMM. Specifically, We selected the four grant program offices based on a range of grant programs managed, legacy systems used, and the amount of grant funding awarded. We also sought to select a cross section of different characteristics, such as selecting larger grant program offices, as well as smaller offices. In addition, we ensured that our selection included the Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) program office because officials in this office represent the first GMM users and, therefore, are more actively involved with the program’s Agile development practices. Based on these factors, we selected: Public Assistance Division, Individual Assistance Division, AFG, and National Fire Academy. Additionally, the four selected grant program offices are responsible for 16 of the total 45 grant programs and are users of five of the nine primary legacy IT systems. The four selected grant program offices also represent about 68 percent of the total grant funding awarded by FEMA from fiscal years 2005 through 2016. We selected two regional offices based on (1) the largest amount of total FEMA grant funding for fiscal years 2005 through 2016—Region 6 located in Denton, Texas; and (2) the highest percentage of AFG funding compared to the office’s total grant funding awarded from fiscal years 2005 through 2016—Region 5 located in Chicago, Illinois. To assess the reliability of data from the program’s automated IT requirements management tool, we interviewed knowledgeable officials about the quality control procedures used by the program to assure accuracy and completeness of the data. We also compared the data to other relevant program documentation on GMM requirements. We determined that the data used were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of evaluating GMM’s practices for managing IT requirements. For our second objective, to assess the reliability of GMM’s estimated costs and schedule, we reviewed documentation on GMM’s May 2017 lifecycle cost estimate and on the program’s schedule, dated May 2018. To assess the reliability of the May 2017 lifecycle cost estimate, we evaluated documentation supporting the estimate, such as the cost estimating model, the report on GMM’s Cost Estimating Baseline Document and Life Cycle Cost Estimate, and briefings provided to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and FEMA management regarding the cost estimate. We assessed the cost estimating methodologies, assumptions, and results against leading practices for developing a comprehensive, accurate, well-documented, and credible cost estimate, identified in GAO’s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide. We also interviewed program officials responsible for developing and reviewing the cost estimate to understand their methodology, data, and approach for developing the estimate. We found that the cost data were sufficiently reliable. To assess the reliability of the May 2018 GMM program schedule, we evaluated documentation supporting the schedule, such as the integrated master schedule, acquisition program baseline, and Agile artifacts. We assessed the schedule documentation against leading practices for developing a comprehensive, well-constructed, credible, and controlled schedule, identified in GAO’s Schedule Assessment Guide. We also interviewed GMM program officials responsible for developing and managing the program schedule to understand their practices for creating and maintaining the schedule. We noted in our report the instances where the quality of the schedule data impacted the reliability of the program’s schedule. For both the cost estimate and program schedule, we assessed each leading practice as: fully addressed—FEMA provided complete evidence that showed it implemented the entire practice area; substantially addressed—FEMA provided evidence that showed it implemented more than half of the practice area; partially addressed—FEMA provided evidence that showed it implemented about half of the practice area; minimally addressed—FEMA provided evidence that showed it implemented less than half of the practice area; not addressed—FEMA did not provide evidence that showed it implemented any of the practice area. Finally, we provided FEMA with draft versions of our detailed analyses of the GMM cost estimate and schedule. This was done to verify that the information on which we based our findings was complete, accurate, and up-to-date. Regarding our third objective, to determine the extent to which FEMA is addressing key cybersecurity practices for GMM, we reviewed documentation regarding DHS and FEMA cybersecurity policies and guidance, and FEMA’s authorization to operate for the program’s engineering and test environment. We evaluated the documentation against all six cybersecurity practices identified in the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) Risk Management Framework. While NIST’s Risk Management Framework identifies six total practices, for reporting purposes, we combined two interrelated practices—selection of security controls and implementation of security controls—into a single practice. The resulting five practices were: categorizing the system based on security risk, selecting and implementing security controls, assessing security controls, obtaining an authorization to operate the system, and monitoring security controls on an ongoing basis. We obtained and analyzed key artifacts supporting the program’s efforts to address these risk management practices, including the program’s System Security Plan, the Security Assessment Plan and Report, Authorization to Operate documentation, and the program’s continuous monitoring documentation. We also interviewed officials from the GMM program office and FEMA’s Office of the Chief Information Officer, such as the GMM Security Engineering Lead, GMM Information System Security Officer, and FEMA’s Acting Chief Information Security Officer, regarding their efforts to assess, document, and review security controls for GMM. We assessed the evidence against the five practices to determine the extent to which the agency had addressed them. We then assessed each practice area as: fully addressed—FEMA provided complete evidence that showed it fully implemented the practice area; partially addressed—FEMA provided evidence that showed it partially implemented the practice area; not addressed—FEMA did not provide evidence that showed it implemented any of the practice area. To assess the reliability of data from the program’s automated security controls management tool, we interviewed knowledgeable officials about the quality control procedures used by the program to assure accuracy and completeness of the data. We also compared the data to other relevant program documentation on GMM security controls for the engineering and test environment. We found that some of the security controls data we examined were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of evaluating FEMA’s cybersecurity practices for GMM, and we noted in our report the instances where the accuracy of the data impacted the program’s ability to address key cybersecurity practices. We conducted this performance audit from December 2017 to April 2019 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) awards many different types of grants to state, local, and tribal governments and nongovernmental entities. These grants are to help communities prevent, prepare for, protect against, mitigate the effects of, respond to, and recover from disasters and terrorist attacks. Agile software development is a type of incremental development that calls for the rapid delivery of software in small, short increments. The use of an incremental approach is consistent with the Office of Management and Budget’s guidance as specified in its information technology (IT) Reform Plan, as well as the legislation commonly referred to as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act. Many organizations, especially in the federal government, are accustomed to using a waterfall software development model, which typically consists of long, sequential phases, and differs significantly from the Agile development approach. Agile practices integrate planning, design, development, and testing into an iterative lifecycle to deliver software early and often. Figure 7 provides a depiction of software development using the Agile approach, as compared to a waterfall approach. The frequent iterations of Agile development are intended to effectively measure progress, reduce technical and programmatic risk, and respond to feedback from stakeholders in changes to IT requirements more quickly than traditional methods. Despite these intended benefits, organizations adopting Agile must overcome challenges in making significant changes to how they are accustomed to developing software. The significant differences between Agile and waterfall development impact how IT programs are planned, implemented, and monitored in terms of cost, schedule, and scope. For example, in waterfall development, significant effort is devoted upfront to document detailed plans and all IT requirements for the entire scope of work at the beginning of the program, and cost and schedule can be varied to complete that work. However, for Agile programs the precise details are unknown upfront, so initial planning of cost, scope, and timing would be conducted at a high level, and then supplemented with more specific plans for each iteration. While cost and schedule are set for each iteration, requirements for each iteration (or increment) can be variable as they are learned over time and revised to reflect experiences from completed iterations and to accommodate changing priorities of the end users. The differences in these two software development approaches are shown in figure 8. Looking at figure 8, the benefit provided from using traditional program management practices such as establishing a cost estimate or a robust schedule, is not obvious. However, unlike a theoretical environment, many government programs may not have the autonomy to manage completely flexible scope, as they must deliver certain minimal specifications with the cost and schedule provided. In those cases, it is vital for the team to understand and differentiate the IT requirements that are “must haves” from the “nice to haves” early in the planning effort. This would help facilitate delivery of the “must-haves” requirements first, thereby providing users with the greatest benefits as soon as possible.

However, FEMA's complex IT environment supporting grants management consists of many disparate systems. In 2008, the agency attempted to modernize these systems but experienced significant challenges. In 2015, FEMA initiated a new endeavor (the GMM program) aimed at streamlining and modernizing the grants management IT environment. GAO was asked to review the GMM program. GAO's objectives were to (1) determine the extent to which FEMA is implementing leading practices for reengineering its grants management processes and incorporating needs into IT requirements; (2) assess the reliability of the program's estimated costs and schedule; and (3) determine the extent to which FEMA is addressing key cybersecurity practices. GAO compared program documentation to leading practices for process reengineering and requirements management, cost and schedule estimation, and cybersecurity risk management, as established by the Software Engineering Institute, National Institute of Standards and Technology, and GAO. Of six important leading practices for effective business process reengineering and information technology (IT) requirements management, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) fully implemented four and partially implemented two for the Grants Management Modernization (GMM) program (see table). Specifically, FEMA ensured senior leadership commitment, took steps to assess its business environment and performance goals, took recent actions to track progress in delivering IT requirements, and incorporated input from end user stakeholders. However, FEMA has not yet fully established plans for implementing new business processes or established complete traceability of IT requirements. Until FEMA fully implements the remaining two practices, it risks delivering an IT solution that does not fully modernize FEMA's grants management systems. While GMM's initial May 2017 cost estimate of about $251 million was generally consistent with leading practices for a reliable, high-quality estimate, it no longer reflects current assumptions about the program. FEMA officials stated in December 2018 that they had completed a revised cost estimate, but it was undergoing departmental approval. GMM's program schedule was inconsistent with leading practices; of particular concern was that the program's final delivery date of September 2020 was not informed by a realistic assessment of GMM development activities, and rather was determined by imposing an unsubstantiated delivery date. Developing sound cost and schedule estimates is necessary to ensure that FEMA has a clear understanding of program risks. Of five key cybersecurity practices, FEMA fully addressed three and partially addressed two for GMM. Specifically, it categorized GMM's system based on security risk, selected and implemented security controls, and monitored security controls on an ongoing basis. However, the program had not initially established corrective action plans for 13 medium- and low-risk vulnerabilities. This conflicts with the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) guidance that specifies that corrective action plans must be developed for every weakness identified. Until FEMA, among other things, ensures that the program consistently follows the department's guidance on preparing corrective action plans for all security vulnerabilities, GMM's system will remain at increased risk of exploits. GAO is making eight recommendations to FEMA to implement leading practices related to reengineering processes, managing requirements, scheduling, and implementing cybersecurity. DHS concurred with all recommendations and provided estimated dates for implementing each of them.""]","14516","gov_report","en","None","217e94f10e4c8ed084bf7e22681c4bbd75d5aa35d3480edd","Summary:","gov_report","532","\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is in the process of modernizing its grants management system, Grants Management Modernization Management Modernization Modernization (GMM) to improve the efficiency and streamline the grants management process.

Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nThe Clean Water Act (CWA) authorizes the principal federal program to aid municipal wastewater treatment plant construction and related eligible activities. Congress established this program in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (P.L. 92-500) (although prior versions of the act had authorized less ambitious grants assistance since 1956). Title II of P.L. 92-500 authorized grants to states for wastewater treatment plant construction under a program administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Federal funds were provided through annual appropriations under a state-by-state allocation formula contained in the act itself. States used their allotments to make grants to cities to build or upgrade wastewater treatment plants, supporting the overall objectives of the act: restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation's waters. The federal share of project costs, originally 75% under P.L. 92-500, was reduced to 55% in 1981. By the mid-1980s, there was considerable policy debate between Congress and the Administration over the future of the act's construction grants program and, in particular, the appropriate federal role in funding municipal water infrastructure projects. Through FY1984, Congress had appropriated nearly $41 billion under this program, representing the largest nonmilitary public works programs since the Interstate Highway System. The grants program was a target of budget cuts in the Reagan Administration, which sought to redirect budgetary priorities in part to sort out the appropriate roles of federal, state, and local governments in a number of domestic policy areas, including water pollution control. The Administration's rationale included several points: The original intent of the program to address the backlog of sewage treatment needs had been virtually eliminated by the mid-1980s. Most remaining projects (such as small, rural systems) were believed to pose little environmental threat and were not appropriate federal responsibilities. State and local governments, in the Administration's view, were fully capable of running construction programs and have a clear responsibility to construct treatment capacity to meet environmental objectives that were primarily established by states. Thus, the Reagan Administration sought a phaseout of the act's construction grants program by 1990. Many states and localities supported the idea of phasing out the grants program, since many were critical of what they viewed as burdensome rules and regulations that accompanied the federal grant money. However, they sought a longer transition and ample flexibility to set up long-term financing to promote state and local self-sufficiency. Congress's response to this debate was contained in 1987 amendments to the act ( P.L. 100-4 , the Water Quality Act of 1987). It authorized $18 billion over nine years for sewage treatment plant construction, through a combination of the Title II grants program and a new State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds program—hereinafter the clean water state revolving fund (CWSRF) program. Under the new program, in CWA Title VI, federal grants would be provided as seed money for state-administered loans to build sewage treatment plants and, eventually, other water quality projects. Cities, in turn, would repay loans to the state, enabling a phaseout of federal involvement while the state built up a source of capital for future investments. Under the amendments, the CWSRF program was phased in beginning in FY1989 (in FY1989 and FY1990, appropriations were split equally between Title II and Title VI grants) and entirely replaced the previous Title II program in FY1991. The intention was that states would have flexibility to set priorities and administer funding, while federal aid would end after FY1994. The CWSRF authorizations for appropriations provided in the 1987 amendments expired in FY1994, but pressure to extend federal funding has continued, in part because, although Congress has appropriated $98 billion in CWA Title II and Title VI wastewater infrastructure assistance since 1972, funding needs remain high: According to the most recent formal estimate by EPA and states (prepared in 2016), an additional $271 billion nationwide is needed over the next 20 years for all types of projects eligible for funding under the act. Congress has continued to appropriate funds, and continued to assist states and localities in meeting wastewater infrastructure needs and complying with CWA requirements. In 1996, Congress established a parallel program under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to help communities finance projects needed to comply with federal drinking water regulations. Funding support for drinking water occurred for several reasons. First, until the 1980s, the number of drinking water regulations was fairly small, and public water systems often did not need to make large investments in treatment technologies to meet those regulations. Second, good quality drinking water traditionally has been available to many communities at relatively low cost. By comparison, essentially all communities have had to construct or upgrade sewage treatment facilities to meet the requirements of the CWA. Over time, drinking water circumstances changed, as communities grew, and commercial, industrial, agricultural, and residential land-uses became more concentrated, thus resulting in more contaminants reaching drinking water sources. Moreover, as the number of federal drinking water standards has increased, many communities have found that their water may not be as good as once thought and that additional treatment technologies are required to meet the new standards and protect public health. Between 1986 and 1996, for example, the number of regulated drinking water contaminants grew from 23 to 83, and EPA and the states expressed concern that many of the nation's 52,000 small community water systems were likely to lack the financial capacity to meet the rising costs of SDWA compliance. According to the most recent EPA-state survey (issued in 2018), future funding needs for projects to treat and deliver public drinking water supplies in the United States are $473 billion over the next 20 years. Congress responded to these concerns by enacting the 1996 SDWA Amendments ( P.L. 104-182 ), which authorized a drinking water state revolving loan fund (DWSRF) program to help systems finance projects needed to comply with SDWA regulations and to protect public health. This program, fashioned after the CWSRF program, authorizes EPA to make grants to states to capitalize DWSRFs which states then use to make loans to public water systems. Appropriations for the program were authorized at $599 million for FY1994 and $1 billion annually for FY1995 through FY2003. Capitalization grants for DWSRF programs were provided for the first time in FY1997. Although the authorizations for appropriations expired in FY2003, Congress continued to provide funding for the program in annual appropriations, totaling $23 billion through FY2019. America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 (AWIA; P.L. 115-270 ), enacted on October 23, 2018, reauthorized appropriations for the DWSRF at $1.17 billion in FY2019, $1.30 billion in FY2020, and $1.95 billion in FY2021. The first section of this report includes a table that summarizes the history of appropriations for both wastewater and drinking water infrastructure programs. The next section discusses several historical developments in water infrastructure funding. The last section contains a detailed chronology of congressional activity regarding wastewater and drinking water infrastructure funding for each fiscal year since the 1987 CWA amendments. Table 1 summarizes funding for the wastewater and drinking infrastructure programs since enactment of the 1987 CWA amendments ( P.L. 100-4 ). Funding for these EPA programs is contained in the appropriations act providing funds for the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies. Within the portion of the bill that funds EPA, wastewater treatment assistance was first specified in an account called Construction Grants, which was subsequently renamed State Revolving Funds/Construction Grants, and then renamed Water Infrastructure. Since FY1996, this account has been titled State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG). The STAG account now includes all water infrastructure funds and management grants provided to assist states in implementing air quality, water quality, and other media-specific environmental programs. The FY1996 appropriation was the first to include both water infrastructure and other state environmental grants; the latter previously were included in EPA's general program management account. Amounts shown in Table 1 include funds for CWA Title II grants, CWSRF grants, drinking water SRF grants, special project grants (discussed below), and the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program. Congress first provided appropriations to cover the subsidy costs of this program in FY2017, as discussed in the detailed chronology section below. Table 1 does not include funds for consolidated state environmental management grants. These grants include funding for a wide range of environmental programs, which have changed over time. In recent years, the categorical grants have included funding for water, air, and waste programs. The categorical grant programs most closely related to water infrastructure issues include grants for states' nonpoint source management programs (CWA Section 319) and states' pollution control programs (CWA Section 106). Funding levels for the environmental management state grants are discussed below in the appropriations chronology section. As an additional comparison, Figure 1 illustrates the total EPA water infrastructure appropriations (for clean water and drinking water assistance combined) between FY1986 and FY2019 in both nominal dollars (i.e., not adjusted for inflation) and constant (2018) dollars (i.e., adjusted for inflation). This section discusses several historical developments of note regarding appropriations for EPA's water infrastructure programs. The practice of earmarking a portion of the construction grants/SRF account for specific wastewater treatment and other water quality projects began with the FY1989 appropriations. The practice increased to the point of representing a significant portion of appropriated funds (31% of the total water infrastructure appropriation in FY1994, for example, but less in subsequent years: 2.5% in FY2009 and 5% in FY2010). The number of projects receiving these earmarked funds also increased: from 4 in FY1989 to 319 in FY2010. Beginning in FY2000, the larger total number of earmarked projects resulted in more communities receiving such grants, but at the same time receiving smaller amounts of funds. Thus, while a few communities received individual earmarked awards of $1 million or more, the average size of earmarked grants shrank: $18.1 million in FY1995, $4.9 million in FY1999, $1.08 million in FY2006, and $586,000 in FY2010. (Conference reports on the individual appropriations bills, noted in the later discussion in this report, provide some detail on projects funded in this manner.) The effective result of earmarking was to reduce the amount of funds provided to states to capitalize their SRF programs. Between FY1989 and FY2010, approximately 10% of the total water infrastructure appropriations ($7.4 billion) went to earmarked project grants. Interest groups representing state water quality program managers and administrators of infrastructure financing programs criticized the practice of earmarked appropriations. They contended that earmarking undermined the intended purpose of the state funds—promoting water quality improvements nationwide. Many state officials preferred funds to be allocated more equitably, not based on what they viewed largely as political considerations, and they preferred for state environmental and financing officials to retain responsibility to set actual spending priorities. Further, they argued that the special projects funding would diminish the level of seed funding to SRFs, delaying the time when SRFs would be financially self-sufficient. The practice of earmarking was criticized because designated projects were arguably receiving more favorable treatment than other communities' projects: They were generally eligible for 55% federal grants (and were not required to repay 100% of the funded project cost, as is the case with a loan through an SRF), and the practice circumvented the standard process of states determining the priority by which projects will receive funding. It also meant that the projects were generally not reviewed by the CWA authorizing committees. This was especially true after FY1992, when special purpose grant funding was designated for types of projects not authorized in the Clean Water Act or the Safe Drinking Water Act. Members of Congress intervened for a specific community for a number of reasons. In some cases, the communities may have been unsuccessful in seeking state approval to fund the project under an SRF loan or other program. For some, the cost of a project financed through a state loan was deemed unacceptably high, because repaying the loan would result in increased user fees that ratepayers felt would have been unduly burdensome. In the early years of this congressional practice, special purpose grant funding originated in the House version of the EPA appropriations bill, while the Senate, for the most part, resisted earmarking by rejecting or reducing amounts and projects included in House-passed legislation. Therefore, special purpose grant funding on several occasions was an issue during the House-Senate conference on the appropriations bill. Beginning in FY1999, however, both the House and Senate proposed earmarked projects in their respective versions of the EPA appropriations bill, with the final total number of projects and dollar amounts determined by conferees. The Clean Water Act Title II grants program effectively ended when authorizations for it expired after FY1990. One result of earmarking special purpose grants in appropriations bills was to continue grants as a method of funding wastewater treatment construction long after FY1990. This practice led Congress to provide EPA grants for drinking water system projects, which had not previously been available. However, as discussed in the next section, general opposition to congressional earmarking stopped the practice after FY2011. The federal percentage share and local match required on special purpose grants varied depending on the project and the year of funding. For example, in the early projects (FY1989), the 1987 CWA amendments specified the federal cost shares, which ranged from 75% to 85%. In FY1992 and FY1993, the appropriations acts specified that funds were provided ""as grants under title II,"" resulting in a requirement for local communities to provide a 45% share of project costs. After FY1993, the appropriations acts themselves were the authority for the special purpose projects grants. In the FY1995 appropriation bill, which also directed allocation of funds appropriated in FY1994 to several needy cities, Congress addressed the issue of federal and local cost shares in report language accompanying the bill, but not in the appropriation act itself. The conferees are in agreement that the agency should work with the grant recipients on appropriate cost-share arrangements. It is the conferees' expectation that the agency will apply the 45% local cost share requirement under Title II of the Clean Water Act in most cases. In the FY1996 appropriations, both the act and accompanying reports were silent on federal/local cost share and applicability of Title II requirements. Because of that, EPA officials planned to require only a 5% local match for most of the special purpose grants in that bill, which is the standard matching requirement for other EPA noninfrastructure grants. Under the agency's rules, the local match could include in-kind services, as well as funding toward the project. In the FY1997 appropriations, Congress included report language as it had in FY1995 concerning federal and local cost share requirements. The conferees are in agreement that the Agency should work with the grant recipients on appropriate cost-share agreements and to that end the conferees direct the Agency to develop a standard cost-share consistent with fiscal year 1995. The FY1998 and FY1999 appropriations included neither bill nor report language on this point. However, language in the House and Senate Appropriations Committees' reports on the FY1998 and FY1999 bills directed EPA to work with grant recipients on appropriate cost-share arrangements. For FY2000, Congress included explicit report language concerning the local match. The conferees agree that the $331,650,000 provided to communities or other entities for construction of water and wastewater treatment facilities and for groundwater protection infrastructure shall be accompanied by a cost-share requirement whereby 45 percent of a project's cost is to be the responsibility of the community or entity consistent with long-standing guidelines for the Agency. These guidelines also offer flexibility in the application of the cost-share requirement for those few circumstances when meeting the 45 percent requirement is not possible. Similar report language concerning local cost-share requirements accompanied the conference reports on the appropriations bills from FY2001 through FY2005. Beginning with FY2004, Congress specified in the appropriations legislation that the local share of project costs shall be not less than 45%. Similarly, beginning with the FY2003 appropriations legislation, Congress also specified that, except for those limited instances in which an applicant meets the criteria for a waiver of the cost-share requirement, the earmarked grant shall provide no more than 55% of an individual project's cost, regardless of the amount appropriated. The practice of earmarking special project water infrastructure grants continued to change. First, in FY2007, Congress applied a one-year moratorium on earmarks in all appropriations bills. For the next three years, special project grants were allowed in appropriations bills—including EPA's—but again in FY2011, no special project funding was provided for congressional projects. Following the 2010 midterm election and during subsequent months while FY2011 appropriations were under consideration (discussed below), the general issue of congressional earmarks of specific projects had become highly controversial because of the overall growing number of them, concern over the influence of special interests on spending decisions, and lack of congressional oversight. In response, President Obama said he would veto any legislation containing earmarks, the House extended the ban on earmarks under the Republican Conferences rules, and the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee announced a moratorium on earmarks for FY2011 and FY2012. Thus, the FY2011 full-year appropriations measure contained no congressionally directed special project funds for water infrastructure projects in the EPA STAG account. However, it did include funds requested by the President: $10 million for Alaska Native Villages and $10 million for U.S.-Mexico border projects. The FY2012 full-year appropriations measure also contained no special project funding in the EPA STAG account. The FY2012 bill did include funds for Alaska Native and Rural Villages ($10 million) and for U.S.-Mexico border projects ($5 million). The moratorium on congressional earmarks has continued. The FY2013 full-year appropriations measure ( P.L. 113-6 ) contained no special project funding in the STAG account. As with other recent bills, however, it did include funds for Alaska Native and Rural Villages ($9.5 million) and for U.S.-Mexico border projects ($4.7 million). Similarly, the moratorium on earmarks continued in FY2014 and FY2015; P.L. 113-76 contained no special project funding in the STAG account for FY2014, but did include funds for Alaska Native and Rural Villages ($10 million) and for U.S.-Mexico border projects ($5 million). The FY2015 funding bill, P.L. 113-235 , was the same as FY2014. The FY2016, FY2017, and FY2018 appropriations acts ( P.L. 114-113 , P.L. 115-31 , and P.L. 115-141 , respectively) included $20 million for Alaska Native and Rural Villages and $10 million for U.S.-Mexico border projects. The FY2019 appropriations act provided $25 million for Alaska Native and Rural Villages and $15 million for U.S.-Mexico border projects. President Trump's FY2020 budget request proposes to eliminate funding for the U.S.-Mexico border program and decrease funding for the Alaska Native and Rural Villages to $3 million. Although the CWSRF and DWSRF have largely functioned as loan programs, both allow the implementing state agency to provide ""additional subsidization"" under certain conditions. Since its amendments in 1996, the SDWA has authorized states to use up to 30% of their DWSRF capitalization grants to provide additional assistance, such as forgiveness of loan principal or negative interest rate loans, to help disadvantaged communities (as determined by the state). In 2018, AWIA increased that percentage to 35% and conditionally required states to provide at least 6% of their annual grants as additional subsidization. Congress amended the CWA in 2014, adding similar provisions to the CWSRF program. In addition, appropriations acts in recent years have required states to use minimum percentages of their allotted funds to provide additional subsidization. This trend began with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-5 ), which required states to use at least 50% of their funds to ""provide additional subsidization to eligible recipients in the form of forgiveness of principal, negative interest loans or grants or any combination of these."" Subsequent appropriation acts have included similar conditions, with varying percentages of subsidization. The FY2016, FY2017, FY2018, and FY2019 appropriations acts included an identical condition, requiring 10% of the CWSRF grants and 20% of the DWSRF grants to be used ""to provide additional subsidy to eligible recipients in the form of forgiveness of principal, negative interest loans, or grants (or any combination of these)."" The 1987 CWA amendments authorized federal grants to assist states in implementing programs to manage water pollution from nonpoint sources such as farm and urban areas, construction, forestry, and mining sites. Because of competing demands for funding, it was difficult for Congress to fund this grant program and other water quality initiatives in the 1987 act. Appropriators did fund Section 319 grants in EPA's general program management account (abatement, control, and compliance) in FY1990, FY1991, and FY1992 but well below authorized levels. In the FY1993 act, appropriators moved funding into the SRF/construction grants account, thereby providing a degree of protection from competing priorities. In FY1996, Congress included all state grants for management of environmental programs in a single consolidated grants appropriation. In doing so, Congress endorsed a Clinton Administration proposal for a more flexible approach to state grants, a key element of EPA's efforts to improve the federal-state partnership in environmental programs. In more recent years, Congress has provided specific funding amounts for certain programs within the categorical grants appropriation. This section summarizes, in chronological order, congressional activity to fund items in the STAG account since the 1987 CWA amendments. The authorization period covered by P.L. 100-4 was FY1986-FY1994. By the time the amendments were enacted, FY1986 was over, as was a portion of FY1987. Thus, appropriations for those two years only indirectly reflected the policy and program changes for later years that were contained in P.L. 100-4 . For FY1986, Congress appropriated a total of $1.8 billion, consisting of $600 million approved in December 1985 (while Congress was beginning to debate reauthorization legislation that eventually was enacted as P.L. 100-4 in January 1987) and $1.2 billion more in July 1986. For FY1987, while debate on CWA reauthorization continued, President Reagan requested $2.0 billion, consistent with his legislative proposal to terminate the grants program by FY1990. In October 1986, Congress appropriated $2.4 billion ( P.L. 99-500 / P.L. 99-591 ). However, only $1.2 billion of that amount was released immediately, pending enactment of a reauthorization bill, which was then in conference. Following enactment of the Water Quality Act of 1987, remaining FY1987 funds were released as part of a supplemental appropriations bill ( P.L. 100-71 ). Conferees on that measure agreed, however, to shift $39 million of the remaining unreleased grant funds to other priority water quality activities authorized in P.L. 100-4 . The final total of construction grant monies was $2.361 billion. For FY1988 the President again requested $2.0 billion. In December 1987, Congress approved legislation providing FY1988 appropriations ( P.L. 100-202 , the omnibus continuing resolution to fund EPA and other federal agencies). In it, Congress appropriated $2.304 billion for construction grants. Final action on the EPA budget and other funding bills had been delayed by budget-cutting talks between Congress and the White House. Reduced construction grants funding was one of many spending cuts required to implement a congressional-White House ""summit agreement"" on the budget. The final construction grants appropriation was less than funding levels that had been included in separate versions of a bill passed by the House and Senate before the budget summit, $2.4 billion. For FY1989, President Reagan requested $1.5 billion, or 35% below FY1988 appropriations and 37.5% less than the authorized level of $2.4 billion for FY1989. In separate versions of an EPA appropriations bill, the House and Senate voted to provide $1.95 billion and $2.1 billion respectively. The final figure, in P.L. 100-404 , was $1.95 billion, which included $68 million for special projects in four states. Thus, the actual amount provided for grants was $1.882 billion. That total was divided equally between the previous Title II grants program and new Title VI SRF program, as provided in the authorizing language of P.L. 100-4 . The FY1989 legislation was the first to include earmarking of funds for specified projects or grants in EPA's construction grants account, an action that continued in subsequent years, as discussed above. All of the projects funded in the 1989 legislation were ones that had been authorized in provisions of the Water Quality Act of 1987 (WQA, P.L. 100-4 ). The designated projects were in Boston (authorized in Section 513 of the WQA, to fund the Boston Harbor wastewater treatment project), San Diego/Tijuana (Section 510, to fund an international sewage treatment project needed because of the flow of raw sewage from Tijuana, Mexico, across the border), Des Moines, IA (Section 515, for sewage treatment plant construction), and Oakwood Beach/Redhook, NY (Section 512 of the WQA, to relocate natural gas distribution facilities that were near wastewater treatment works in New York City). For FY1990, President Reagan's budget requested $1.2 billion in wastewater treatment assistance, or 50% less than the authorized level and 38.5% less than the FY1989 enacted amount of $1.95 billion. Further, the Reagan budget proposed that the $1.2 billion consist of $800 million in Title VI monies and $400 million in Title II grants, contrary to provisions of the CWA directing that appropriations be equally divided between the two grant programs, as in FY1989. President Bush's revised FY1990 budget, presented in March 1989, made no changes from the Reagan budget in this area. In acting on this request, Congress agreed to provide $2.05 billion, including $46 million for three special projects (Boston, San Diego/Tijuana, and Des Moines), leaving a total of $1.002 billion each for Titles II and VI ( P.L. 101-144 ). Title II funds were reduced by $6.8 million, however, due to funds earmarked for a specific project in South Carolina. Although these amounts were appropriated, all funds in the bill were reduced by 1.55% (or, a $31.8 million reduction from the construction grants account) to provide funds for the federal government's antidrug program. Final FY1990 appropriations were altered again by passage of the FY1990 Budget Reconciliation measure and implementation of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act (the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act), which established procedures to reduce budget deficits annually, resulting in a zero deficit by 1993. For each fiscal year that the deficit was estimated to exceed maximum targets established in law, an automatic spending reduction procedure was triggered to eliminate deficits in excess of the targets through ""sequestration,"" or permanent cancellation of budgetary resources. Thus, to meet budget reduction mandates and, in particular, deficit reduction targets under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act (the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act), additional funding cuts were included in P.L. 101-239 , the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, affecting construction grants funding and all other accounts not exempted from Gramm-Rudman procedures. P.L. 101-239 provided that the ""sequestration"" procedures under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act would be allowed to apply for a portion of FY1990 (for 130 days, or 35.6% of the year), providing an additional automatic spending reduction in EPA and other agencies' programs subject to the act. As a result of these reductions, funding for wastewater treatment aid in FY1990 totaled $1.98 billion, or $30 million more than in FY1989. The total included $53 million for special projects in San Diego, Boston, Des Moines, and Honea Path/Ware Shoals, SC, $960 million for Title II grants, and $967 million for Title VI grants. The combined reductions amounted to 3.4% less than the amount agreed to by conferees on P.L. 101-144 (i.e., $2.05 billion), before subtracting funds for antidrug programs and accounting for effects of the Gramm-Rudman partial-year sequester. For FY1991, President Bush requested $1.6 billion in funding for wastewater treatment assistance. This total included $15.4 million for the San Diego project authorized in Section 510 of the Water Quality Act of 1987, to fund construction of an international sewage treatment project. The remainder, $1.584 billion, would be only for capitalization grants under Title VI of the act, as the 1987 legislation provides for no new Title II grants after FY1990. In acting on EPA's appropriations for FY1991 ( P.L. 101-507 ), Congress agreed to provide $2.1 billion in wastewater treatment assistance. Beginning in FY1991, all appropriated funds are utilized for capitalization grants under Title VI of the act (as provided in the Water Quality Act of 1987); funding for the traditional Title II grants program was no longer available. The enacted level included several earmarkings: $15.7 million for San Diego (Section 510 of the WQA), $20 million for Boston Harbor (Section 513 of the WQA), and $16.5 million for a new Water Quality Cooperative Agreement Program under Section 104(b)(3) of the act. The President's budget had requested $16.5 million to support state permitting, enforcement, and water quality management activities, especially to offset the reductions in aid to states due to elimination of state management setasides from the previous Title II construction grants program. Congress agreed to the level requested, but provided it as a portion of the wastewater treatment appropriation, rather than as part of EPA's general program management appropriation, as in the President's request. As a result of these earmarkings, $2.048 billion was provided for Title VI grants. For FY1992, President Bush requested $1.9 billion in wastewater treatment funds, or $100 million more than authorized under the Water Quality Act of 1987 for Title VI grants in FY1992. However, out of the $1.9 billion total, the President's request sought $1.5 billion for Title VI SRF grants and $400 million as grants under the expired Title II construction grants program for the following coastal cities: Boston, San Diego, New York, Los Angeles, and Seattle. Two of the five designated projects had been authorized in the 1987 CWA amendments; the other three did not have explicit statutory authorization. Also, $16.5 million was requested for Water Quality Cooperative Agreement grants to the states. In acting on the request in November 1991, Congress provided total wastewater funds of $2.4 billion ( P.L. 102-139 ). The total was allocated as follows: $1,948.5 million for SRF capitalization grants, $16.5 million for Section 104(b)(3) grants, $49 million for the special project in San Diego-Tijuana (Section 510 of the Water Quality Act), $46 million to the Rouge River (MI) National Wet Weather Demonstration Project, and $340 million as construction grants under title II of the Clean Water Act for several other special projects—the Back River Wastewater Treatment Plant (Baltimore), Maryland, the Boston Harbor project, New York City, Los Angeles, San Diego (a wastewater reclamation project), and Seattle. This appropriation bill was the first to include special purpose grant funding for several projects not specifically authorized in the Clean Water Act or amendments to that law. For FY1993, President Bush requested $2.484 billion for state revolving funds/construction grants (now called the water infrastructure account). The requested total included $340 million to be targeted for 55% construction grants to six communities: Boston, New York, Los Angeles, San Diego, Seattle, and Baltimore. In addition, the President requested that $130 million be directed toward a Mexican Border Initiative, consisting of $65 million for construction of the international treatment plant at San Diego (to address the Tijuana sewage problem), $15 million for projects at Nogales, AZ, and New River, CA, and $50 million as 50% grants for colonias in Texas. The President also requested $16.5 million for Section 104(b)(3) grants. Along with these special project and grant amounts, the request sought $2.014 billion for SRF assistance. Final action on FY1993 funding occurred on September 25, 1992 ( P.L. 102-389 ). It provided an appropriation of $2.55 billion, but $622.5 million of this amount was reserved for special projects and other grants. The bill provided $50 million in CWA Section 319 grants and $16.5 million in Section 104(b)(3) grants out of the SRF amount. It included $556 million for the following special purpose grants: the international treatment plant at San Diego (Tijuana—Section 510 of the WQA, with bill language capping funding for that project at $239.4 million), plus projects in Boston; New York; Los Angeles; San Diego; Seattle; Rouge River, MI; Baltimore; Ocean County, NJ; Atlanta; and for colonias in Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico. The final SRF grant amount under the bill was $1.928 billion. Early in 1993, President Clinton requested that Congress approve ""economic stimulus and investment"" spending, in the form of supplemental FY1993 appropriations. Both his original proposal and a subsequent modified proposal included additional SRF grant funds, but neither of the bills enacted by Congress in response to these requests ( P.L. 103-24 , P.L. 103-50 ) provided additional SRF funds. For FY1994, the Clinton Administration requested $2.047 billion for water infrastructure. The funds in this request were $1.198 billion to capitalize State Revolving Funds, $150 million for Mexican border project grants, and $100 million for a single hardship community (Boston). The request also included $599 million to capitalize new state drinking water revolving funds. The final version of the FY1994 legislation ( P.L. 103-124 ) provided $2.477 billion for water infrastructure/state revolving funds. Of this total amount, $599 million was to be reserved for drinking water SRFs, if authorization legislation were enacted; $80 million was for Section 319 grants; $22 million was for Section 104(b)(3) grants; and $58 million was for Tijuana/San Diego—Section 510 of the WQA. This resulted in an appropriation of $1.718 billion for clean water SRFs. In addition, the final bill provided that $500 million be used to support water infrastructure financing in economically distressed/hardship communities. Under the bill, these funds were not available for spending until May 31, 1994, and were set aside until projects were authorized in the CWA for this purpose. Thus, the bill as enacted provided $1.218 billion immediately for clean water SRFs, with the expectation that $500 million more would be available for financing hardship community projects after May 31, 1994. For FY1995, President Clinton requested $2.65 billion for water infrastructure consisting of $1.6 billion for CWA SRFs, $100 million for Section 319 nonpoint source management grants to states, $52.5 million for a grant to San Diego for a wastewater project pursuant to Section 510 of the WQA, $47.5 million for other Mexican border projects, $50 million to the state of Texas for colonias projects, and $100 million for grants under Title II for needy cities (intended for Boston). The request included $700 million for drinking water SRFs, pending enactment of authorizing legislation. The President's budget also requested $21.5 million for Section 104(b)(3) grants/cooperative agreements. Final agreement on FY1995 funding was contained in P.L. 103-327 , enacted in September 1994, which provided a total of $2.962 billion for water infrastructure financing. Of the total, $22.5 million was for grants under Section 104(b), $100 million for Section 319 grants, $70 million for Public Water System Supervision program grants (grants to states under the Safe Drinking Water Act to support state implementation of delegated drinking water programs), $52.5 million for the Section 510 project in San Diego, and $700 million for drinking water SRFs (contingent upon enactment of authorization legislation). The remaining $2.017 billion was for CWA projects. Of this amount, $1.235 billion was for clean water SRF grants to states under Title VI of the CWA. The remaining $781.8 million (39% of this amount, 26% of the total appropriation) was designated for 45 specific, named projects in 22 states. The earmarked amounts ranged in size from $200,000 for Southern Fulton County, PA, to $100 million for the city of Boston. Finally, the conferees included bill language concerning release of the $500 million in FY1994 needy cities money (because the authorizing committees of Congress had not acted on legislation to authorize specific projects, as had been intended in P.L. 103-124 ) as follows: $150 million to Boston, $50 million for colonias in Texas, $10 million for colonias in New Mexico, $70 million for a New York City wastewater reclamation facility, $85 million for the Rouge River project, $50 million for the city of Los Angeles, $50 million for the county of Los Angeles, and $35 million for Seattle, WA. In February 1995, President Clinton submitted the Administration's budget request for FY1996. It requested $2.365 billion for water infrastructure funding consisting of $1.6 billion for clean water state revolving funds, $500 million for drinking water state revolving funds, $150 million to support Mexico border projects under the U.S.-Mexican Border Environmental Initiative and NAFTA, and $100 million for special need/economically distressed communities (not specified in the request, but presumed to be intended for Boston), plus $15 million for water infrastructure needs in Alaska Native Villages. In February 1995, congressional appropriations committees began considering legislation to rescind previously appropriated FY1995 funds, as part of overall efforts by the 104 th Congress to shape the budget and federal spending. These efforts resulted in passage in July 1995 of P.L. 104-19 , which rescinded $16.5 billion in total funds from a number of departments, agencies, and programs. In the water infrastructure area, it rescinded $1,077,200,000 from prior year appropriations including the $3.2 million for a project in New Jersey (it had mistakenly been funded twice in P.L. 103-327 ) and $1,074,000,000 in other water infrastructure appropriations. Although not contained in bill language, it was understood that the larger rescinded amount consisted solely of drinking water SRF funds (leaving $1.235 billion for FY1995 clean water SRF funds, $778.6 million for earmarked wastewater projects—both amounts as originally appropriated—and $225 million in FY1994-FY1995 drinking water SRF funds that had not yet been authorized). It took until April 1996 for Congress and the Administration to reach agreement on FY1996 appropriations for EPA as part of omnibus legislation ( P.L. 104-134 ) that consolidated five appropriations bills not yet enacted due to disagreements over funding levels and policy. Agreement came as the fiscal year was more than one-half over. Before that, however, congressional conferees reached agreement in November 1995 on FY1996 legislation for EPA ( H.R. 2099 , H.Rept. 104-353 ). Conferees agreed to provide $2.323 billion for a new account titled State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG), consisting of infrastructure assistance and state environmental management grants for 16 categorical programs that had previously been funded in a separate appropriations account. The total included $1.125 billion for clean water SRF grants, $275 million in new appropriations for drinking water SRF grants, and $265 million for special purpose project grants. Report language provided that the drinking water SRF money also included $225 million from FY1995 appropriations rescinded in P.L. 104-19 . The drinking water SRF money would be available upon enactment of SDWA reauthorization legislation that would authorize a drinking water SRF program; otherwise, it would revert to clean water SRF grants if the SDWA were not reauthorized by June 30, 1996. This made the total potentially available for drinking water SRF grants $500 million. The November 1995 agreement on H.R. 2099 included $658 million for consolidated state environmental grants. In doing so, Congress endorsed an Administration proposal for a more flexible approach to state grants, a key element of EPA's efforts to improve the federal-state partnership in environmental programs. In lieu of traditional grants provided separately to support state air, water, hazardous waste, and other programs, consolidated grants are intended to reduce administrative burdens and improve environmental performance by allowing states and tribes to target funds to meet their specific needs and integrate their environmental programs, as appropriate. Congress's support was described in accompanying report language. The conferees agree that Performance Partnership Grants are an important step to reducing the burden and increasing the flexibility that state and tribal governments need to manage and implement their environmental protection programs. This is an opportunity to use limited resources in the most effective manner, yet at the same time, produce the results-oriented environmental performance necessary to address the most pressing concerns while still achieving a clean environment. Including state environmental grants in the same account with water infrastructure assistance reflected Congress's support for enhancing the ability of states and localities to implement environmental programs flexibly and support for EPA's ability to provide block grants to states and Indian tribes. The H.R. 2099 conference agreement also included legislative riders intended to limit or prohibit EPA from spending money to implement several environmental programs. The Administration opposed the riders. The House and Senate approved this bill in December, but President Clinton vetoed it, because of objections to spending and policy aspects of the legislation. With no full-year funding in place from October 1995 to April 1996, EPA and the programs it administers (along with agencies and departments covered by four other appropriations bills not yet enacted) were subject to a series of short-term continuing resolutions, some lasting only a day, some lasting several weeks. In March 1996, the House and Senate began consideration of an omnibus appropriations bill to fund EPA and other agencies for the remainder of FY1996, finally reaching agreement in April on a bill ( H.R. 3019 ) enacted as P.L. 104-134 . Congress agreed to provide $2.813 billion for a new account titled STAG, consisting of state grants and infrastructure assistance, as in H.R. 2099 , the vetoed measure. The total was divided as follows: $1.3485 billion for clean water SRF grants (including $50 million for impoverished communities), $500 million in new appropriations for drinking water SRF grants, $150 million for Mexico-border project grants and Texas colonias , as requested, $15 million for Alaska Native Villages, as requested, $141.5 million for 17 special purpose project grants, and $658 million for consolidated state environmental grants, which states could use to administer a range of delegated environmental programs. Report language provided that the drinking water SRF money also included $225 million from FY1995 appropriations that remained available after the rescissions in P.L. 104-19 , for a total of $725 million. The drinking water SRF money was contingent upon enactment of legislation authorizing an SRF program under the Safe Drinking Water Act by August 1, 1996; otherwise, it would revert to clean water SRF grants. The final agreement ( P.L. 104-134 ) included several of the legislative riders from previous versions of the legislation, including riders related to drinking water and clean air, but dropped others strongly opposed by the Administration. Funds within the STAG account were redistributed after Congress passed Safe Drinking Water Act amendments in August 1996. Enactment of the amendments ( P.L. 104-182 ) occurred on August 6—after the August 1 deadline in P.L. 104-134 that would have made $725 million available for drinking water SRF grants in FY1996. Thus, the previously appropriated $725 million reverted to clean water SRF grants, making the FY1996 total for those grants $2.0735 billion. While debate over the FY1996 appropriations was continuing, in March 1996, President Clinton submitted the details of a FY1997 budget. For water infrastructure and state and tribal assistance, the request totaled $2.852 billion consisting of $1.35 billion for clean water SRF grants (the request included language that would authorize states the discretion to use this SRF money either for clean water or drinking water projects), $165 million for U.S.-Mexico border projects, Texas colonias , and Alaska Native Village projects, $113 million for needy cities projects, $550 million for drinking water infrastructure SRF funding, contingent upon enactment of authorizing legislation, and $674 million for state performance partnership consolidated management grants, which could address a range of environmental programs. In response to the Administration's request, in June 1996 the House approved legislation ( H.R. 3666 ) providing FY1997 funding for EPA. In the STAG account, the House approved $2.768 billion, $84 million less than requested but on the whole endorsing the budget request. The total provided the following: $1.35 billion for clean water SRF grants, as requested; $165 million, as requested, for U.S.-Mexico Border projects, Texas colonias , and Alaska Native Village projects; $450 million for drinking water SRF funding, contingent upon authorization; $674 million for state performance partnership consolidated management grants; and $129 million for seven special purpose grants. In July, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported its version of H.R. 3666 . The committee approved $2.815 billion for this account, consisting of $1.426 billion for clean water SRF grants; $550 million for drinking water SRF grants, contingent upon authorization; $165 million, as requested, for U.S.-Mexico border projects, Texas colonias , and Alaska Native Village projects; and $674 million for consolidated state grants. The committee rejected the provision of the House-passed bill providing $129 million for special purpose grants, including funds for Boston and New Orleans requested by the Administration, saying in report language that earmarking is provided at the expense of state revolving funds and does not represent an equitable distribution of grant funds ( S.Rept. 104-318 ). During debate on H.R. 3666 in September, the Senate adopted an amendment to reduce the FY1997 appropriation for clean water SRF grants by $725 million in order to fund the new drinking water SRF program. This action was intended to restore funds to the drinking water program which had been lost when Safe Drinking Water Act amendments were not enacted by August 1, 1996. Thus, the Senate-passed bill provided $701 million for clean water SRF grants and $1.275 billion for drinking water SRF grants for FY1997. Other amounts in the account were unchanged. The conference report on H.R. 3666 ( H.Rept. 104-812 ) was approved by the House and Senate on September 24, 1996. President Clinton signed the bill September 26 ( P.L. 104-204 ). It reflected compromise of the House- and Senate-passed bills, providing the following amounts within the STAG account ($2.875 billion total): $625 million for clean water SRF grants, $1.275 billion for drinking water SRF grants, $165 million, as requested, for U.S.-Mexico border projects, Texas colonias , and Alaska Native Village projects, $136 million for 18 specific wastewater, water, and groundwater project grants (the 7 specified in House-passed H.R. 3666 , plus 11 more; the bill provided funds for each of the needy cities projects requested by the Administration, but in lesser amounts), and $674 million for consolidated state grants, which could support implementation of a range of environmental programs. The allocation of clean water and drinking water SRF grants was consistent with the Senate's action to restore funds to the drinking water program after enactment of the Safe Drinking Water Act amendments in early August. Subsequently, Congress passed a FY1997 Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations bill to cover agencies and departments for which full-year funding had not been enacted by October 1, 1996 ( P.L. 104-208 ). It included additional funding for several EPA programs, as well as $35 million (on top of $40 million provided in P.L. 104-204 ) for the Boston Harbor cleanup project. President Clinton presented the Administration's budget request for FY1998 in February 1997. For water infrastructure and state and tribal assistance, the request totaled $2.793 billion, consisting of $1.075 billion for clean water SRF grants, $725 million for drinking water SRF grants, $715 million for consolidated state environmental grants, and $278 million for special project grants. House and Senate committees began activities on FY1998 funding bills somewhat late in 1997, due to prolonged negotiations between Congress and the President over a five-year budget plan to achieve a balanced budget by 2002. After appropriators took up the FY1998 funding bills in June, the House passed EPA's appropriation in H.R. 2158 ( H.Rept. 105-175 ) on July 15. In the STAG account, the House approved $3.019 billion, consisting of $1.25 billion for clean water SRF grants ($600 million more than FY1997 levels and $175 million more than requested by the President), $750 million for drinking water SRF grants ($425 million less than FY1997 levels, but $25 million more than the request), $750 million for state environmental assistance grants, and $269 million for special projects. The latter included funds for the special projects requested by the Administration but at reduced levels ($149 million total for these projects), plus $120 million in special project grants for 21 other communities. The Senate passed a separate version of an FY1998 appropriations bill on July 22, 1997 ( S. 1034 , S.Rept. 105-53 ). It provided $3.047 billion for the STAG account, consisting of $1.35 billion for clean water SRF grants, $725 million for drinking water SRF grants, $725 million for state environmental assistance grants, and $247 million for special project grants. The Senate bill provided the amounts requested by the Administration for U.S.-Mexico border projects, Texas colonias , and Alaska Native Village projects (but no special funds for others requested by the President), plus $82 million for 18 special project grants for other communities identified in report language. Conferees reached agreement on FY1998 funding in early October 1997 ( H.R. 2158 , H.Rept. 105-297 ). The final version passed the House on October 8 and passed the Senate on October 9. President Clinton signed the bill October 27 ( P.L. 105-65 ). As enacted, it provided $3.213 billion for the STAG account, consisting of $1.35 billion for clean water SRF grants, $725 million for drinking water SRF grants, $745 million for consolidated state environmental assistance grants (which could address a range of environmental programs), and $393 million for 42 special purpose project and special community need grants for construction of wastewater, water treatment and drinking water facilities, and groundwater protection infrastructure. It included the following amounts for grants requested by the Administration: $75 million for U.S.-Mexico border projects, $50 million for Texas colonias , $50 million for Boston Harbor wastewater needs, $10 million for New Orleans, $3 million for Bristol County, MA, and $15 million for Alaska Native Village projects. The final bill also provided funds for all of the special purpose projects included in the separate House and Senate versions of the legislation, plus three projects not included in either earlier version. Bill language was included in P.L. 105-65 to allow states to cross-collateralize clean water and drinking water SRF funds, that is, to use the combined assets of amounts appropriated to State Revolving Funds as common security for both SRFs, which conferees said is intended to ensure maximum opportunity for states to leverage these funds. Senate committee report language also said that the conference report on the 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments had stated that bond pooling and similar arrangements were not precluded under that legislation. The appropriations bill language was intended to ensure that EPA does not take an unduly narrow interpretation of this point which would restrict the states' use of SRF funds. On November 1, 1997, President Clinton used his authority under the Line Item Veto Act ( P.L. 104-130 ) to cancel six items of discretionary budget authority provided in P.L. 105-65 . The President's authority under this act took effect in the 105 th Congress; thus, this was the first EPA appropriations bill affected by it. The cancelled items included funding for one of the special purpose grants in the bill, $500,000 for new water and sewer lines in an industrial park in McConnellsburg, PA. Reasons for the cancellation, according to the President, were that the project had not been requested by the Administration; it would primarily benefit a private entity and is outside the scope of EPA's usual mission; it is a low priority use of environmental funds; and it would provide funding outside the normal process of allocating funds according to state environmental priorities. However, in June 1998, the Supreme Court struck down the Line Item Veto Act as unconstitutional, and in July the Office of Management and Budget announced that funding would be released for 40-plus cancellations made in 1997 under that act (including those cancelled in P.L. 105-65 ) that Congress had not previously overturned. (For additional information, see CRS Report RL33635, Item Veto and Expanded Impoundment Proposals: History and Current Status , by Virginia A. McMurtry.) President Clinton's budget request for FY1999, presented to Congress in February 1998, requested $2.9 billion for the STAG account, representing 37% of the $7.9 billion total requested for EPA programs. The total included $1.075 billion for clean water SRF grants, $775 million for drinking water SRF grants, $115 million for water infrastructure projects along the U.S.-Mexico border projects and in Alaska Native Villages, $78 million for needy cities projects, and $875 million for consolidated state environmental grants (which could address a range of environmental programs). Legislative action on the budget request occurred in mid-1998. Both houses of Congress increased amounts for water infrastructure financing, finding the Administration's request for clean water and drinking water SRF grants, as well as special project funding, not adequate. First, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported its version of an EPA spending bill in June 1998 ( S. 2168 , S.Rept. 105-216 ). This bill, passed by the Senate July 17, provided $3.2 billion for the STAG account, consisting of $1.4 billion for clean water SRF grants, $800 million for drinking water SRF grants, $105 million for U.S.-Mexico and Alaska Native Village projects, $100 million for 39 other special needs infrastructure grants, and $850 million for state performance partnership/categorical grants. As in FY1998, the committee included bill language allowing states to cross-collateralize their clean water and drinking water state revolving funds, making the language explicit for FY1999 and thereafter. Second, the House passed its version of EPA's funding bill ( H.R. 4194 , H.Rept. 105-610 ) on July 29. This bill provided $3.2 billion for the STAG account, consisting of $1.25 billion for clean water SRF grants, $775 million for drinking water SRF grants, $70 million for U.S.-Mexico and Alaska Native Village projects, $253.5 million for 49 other special needs infrastructure grants (including nine projects also funded in the Senate bill), and $885 million for state environmental management grants (a 20% increase above FY1998 amounts for these state grants). Conferees resolved differences between the two versions in October 1998 ( H.R. 4194 , H.Rept. 105-769 ). The conference agreement provided $3.4 billion for the STAG account, consisting of $1.35 billion for clean water SRF grants, $775 million for drinking water SRF grants, $80 million for U.S.-Mexico and Alaska Native and Rural Village projects, $301.8 million for 80 other special needs project grants, and $880 million for state and tribal environmental program grants (which could address a range of environmental programs). The House and Senate approved the agreement on October 7 and 8, respectively, and President Clinton signed the bill into law on October 21 ( P.L. 105-276 ). Additional funding was provided in the Omnibus Consolidated and Supplemental Appropriations Act, FY1999 ( P.L. 105-277 ). This bill, which provided full-year funding for agencies and departments covered by seven separate appropriations measures, directed $20 million more in special needs grants for the Boston Harbor wastewater infrastructure project, on top of $30 million that was included in P.L. 105-276 . For FY2000, beginning on October 1, 1999, the Administration requested $2.638 billion for water infrastructure assistance and state environmental grants. The total, $370 million less than the FY1999 appropriation for this account, consisted of $800 million for clean water SRF grants, $825 million for drinking water SRF grants, $128 million for Mexican border and special project grants, and $885 million for consolidated state environmental grants (which could address a range of environmental programs). The request included one SRF policy issue. The Administration asked the appropriators to grant states the permission to set aside up to 20% of FY2000 clean water SRF monies in the form of grants for local communities to implement nonpoint source pollution and estuary management projects. Under the Clean Water Act, SRFs may only be used to provide loans. Some have argued that some types of water pollution projects which are eligible for SRF funding may not be suitable for loans, as they may not generate revenues which can be used to repay the loan to a state. This new authority, the Administration said, would allow states greater flexibility to address nonpoint pollution problems. Critics of the proposal said that making grants from an SRF would reduce the long-term integrity of a state's fund, since grants would not be repaid. Some Members of Congress and stakeholder groups were particularly critical of the budget request for clean water SRF grants, $550 million (40%) less than the FY1999 level. Critics said the request was insufficient to meet the needs of states and localities for clean water infrastructure. In response, EPA acknowledged that several years prior the Clinton Administration had made a commitment to states that the clean water SRF would revolve at $2 billion annually in the year 2005. Because of loan repayments and other factors, EPA said, the overall fund will be revolve at $2 billion per year in the year 2002, even with the 20% grant setaside included in the FY2000 request. According to EPA, the $550 million decrease from 1999 would have only a limited impact on SRFs and would still allow the agency to meet its long-term capitalization goal of providing an average amount of $2 billion in annual assistance. The House and Senate passed their respective versions of an EPA appropriations bill ( H.R. 2684 ) in September 1999. The conference committee report resolving differences between the two versions ( H.Rept. 106-379 ) was passed by the House on October 14 and the Senate on October 15 and was signed by the President on October 20 ( P.L. 106-74 ). The final bill provided $7.6 billion overall for EPA programs, including $3.47 billion for the STAG account. Within that account, the bill included $1.35 billion for clean water SRF grants, $820 million for drinking water SRF grants, $885 million for categorical state grants (which generally support state and tribal implementation and could address a range of environmental programs), $80 million for U.S.-Mexico border and Alaska Rural and Native Village projects, and $331.6 million for 141 other special needs water and wastewater grants specified in report language. The final bill did not approve the Administration's request to allow states to use up to 20% of clean water SRF monies as grants for nonpoint pollution and estuary management projects. Subsequent to enactment of the EPA funding bill, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 with funding for five other agencies ( P.L. 106-113 ), which included provisions requiring a government-wide cut of 0.38% in discretionary appropriations. The bill gave the President some flexibility in applying this across-the-board reduction. Details of the reduction were announced at the time of the release of the FY2001 budget. EPA's distribution of the rescission resulted in a total reduction of $16.3 million for 139 of the special needs water and wastewater projects identified in P.L. 106-74 . These projects were reduced 4.9% below enacted levels. The agency did not reduce funds for the two projects that had been included in the President's FY2000 budget request (Bristol County, MA, and New Orleans, LA) or for the United States-Mexico border and the Alaska Rural and Native Villages programs. EPA also reduced funds for the clean water SRF (enacted at $1.35 billion) by 0.3%, for a final funding level of $1.345 billion. The appropriation level was not reduced for the drinking water SRF or consolidated state grants. The President's budget for FY2001 requested a total of $2.9 billion for water infrastructure assistance and state environmental grants. For the second year in a row, President Clinton requested $800 million for the clean water SRF program, a $545 million reduction from the FY2000 level. The request included $825 million for the drinking water SRF program, $100 million for U.S.-Mexico border project grants, $15 million for Alaska Native Villages projects, two needy cities grants totaling $13 million (Bristol County, MA, and New Orleans, LA), plus $1.069 billion for consolidated state environmental grants (which could address a range of environmental programs). The budget included a policy request similar to one in the FY2000 budget, which Congress rejected. The FY2001 budget sought flexibility for states to set aside up to 19% of clean water SRF monies in the form of grants for local communities to implement nonpoint source pollution and estuary management projects. The House approved its version of EPA's funding bill ( H.R. 4635 , H.Rept. 106-674 ) on June 21, 2000. For the STAG account, H.R. 4635 provided $3.2 billion ($273 million more than requested, but $288 million below the FY2000 level). The total in the STAG account consisted of $1.2 billion for clean water SRF grants, $825 million for drinking water SRF grants, $1.068 billion (the budget request) for categorical state grants, and $85 million for U.S.-Mexico border and Alaska Rural and Native Villages projects. Beyond these, however, the House-passed bill included no funds for other special needs grants. The Senate approved its version of the funding bill ( S.Rept. 106-410 ) on October 12, 2000. For the STAG account, the Senate-passed bill provided $3.3 billion, consisting of $1.35 billion for clean water SRF grants, $820 million for drinking water SRF grants, $955 million for categorical state grants, $85 million for U.S.-Mexico border and Alaska Rural and Native Village projects, and $110 million for special needs water and wastewater grants. In October, the House and Senate approved EPA's funding bill for FY2001 ( H.Rept. 106-988 ), providing $1.35 billion for clean water SRF grants (the same level enacted for FY2000) and $825 million for drinking water SRF grants. The enacted bill included $110 million in grants for water infrastructure projects in Alaska Rural and Native Villages and U.S.-Mexico border projects and an additional $336 million for 237 other specified project grants throughout the country. The bill also provided $1,008 million for state categorical program grants ($60 million less in total than requested), which states could use to address a range of environmental programs. Total funding for the STAG account was $3.6 billion. Congress disapproved the Administration's policy request concerning use of clean water SRF monies for nonpoint source project grants. President Clinton signed the bill October 27, 2000 ( P.L. 106-377 ). Subsequently, in December, Congress provided $21 million more for five more special project water infrastructure grants (in addition to the $336 million in P.L. 106-377 ) as a provision of H.R. 4577 , the FY2001 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 106-554 ). Also in that legislation, Congress enacted the Wet Weather Water Quality Act, authorizing a two-year, $1.5 billion grants program to reduce wet weather flows from municipal sewer systems. The provision was included in Section 112, Division B, of P.L. 106-554 . In April 2001, the Bush Administration presented its budget request for FY2002. The Administration requested a total of $2.1 billion for clean water infrastructure funds, consisting of $823 million for drinking water SRF grants, $850 million for clean water SRF grants (compared with $1.35 billion appropriated for FY2001), and $450 million for the new program of municipal sewer overflow grants under legislation enacted in December, the Wet Weather Water Quality Act. However, that act provided that sewer overflow grants are only available in years when at least $1.35 billion in clean water SRF grants is appropriated. Subsequently, Administration officials said they would request that Congress modify the provision linking new grant funds to at least $1.35 billion in clean water SRF grants. The Bush budget requested no funds for special earmarked grants, except for $75 million to fund projects along the U.S.-Mexico border and $35 million for projects in Alaska Native Villages (both are the same amounts provided in FY2001). In response, some Members of Congress and outside groups criticized the budget request, saying that it did not provide enough support for water infrastructure programs. The President's budget also requested $1.06 billion for state categorical program grants, which generally support state and tribal administration of a range of environmental programs. The House passed its version of FY2002 funding for EPA on July 30 ( H.R. 2620 , H.Rept. 107-159 ). The House-passed bill provided a total of $2.4 billion for water infrastructure funds, consisting of $1.2 billion for clean water SRF grants, $850 million for drinking water SRF grants, $200 million for special project grants (individual projects were unspecified in the report accompanying H.R. 2620 ), $75 million for U.S.-Mexico border projects, and $30 million for Alaska Rural and Native Villages. The House bill provided no separate funds for the new wet weather overflow grant program, which the Administration had requested. Including $1.08 billion for state categorical program grants, total STAG account funding in the bill was $3.44 billion, about $150 million higher than the President's request. The Senate passed its version of this appropriations bill on August 2 ( S. 1216 , S.Rept. 107-43 ). Like the House, the Senate rejected separate funding for wet weather overflow grants, and the Senate increased clean water SRF grant funding to the FY2001 level. The Senate-passed total for the STAG account was $3.49 billion, including $1.35 billion for clean water SRF grants, $850 million for drinking water SRF grants, $140 million for special needs infrastructure grants specified in accompanying report language, $75 million for U.S.-Mexico border projects, $30 million for Alaska Rural and Native Villages, and $1.03 billion for state categorical program grants. Resolution of this and other appropriations bills in fall 2001 was complicated by congressional attention to general economic conditions and responses to the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Nevertheless, the House and Senate gave final approval to legislation providing EPA's FY2002 funding ( H.R. 2620 , H.Rept. 107-272 ) on November 8, and President Bush signed the bill on November 26 ( P.L. 107-73 ). The final bill did not include separate funds for the new sewer overflow grant program requested by the Administration, which both the House and Senate had rejected, but it did include $1.35 billion for clean water SRF grants, $850 million for drinking water SRF grants, $344 million for 337 earmarked water infrastructure project grants specified in report language, and the requested $75 million for U.S.-Mexico border projects and $30 million for Alaska Rural and Native Villages. The bill included total STAG funding of $3.7 billion. President Bush presented the Administration's FY2003 budget request in February 2002, asking Congress to appropriate $2.185 billion for EPA's water infrastructure programs (compared with $2.659 billion appropriated for FY2002). The FY2003 request sought $1.212 billion for clean water SRF grants, $850 million for drinking water SRF grants, and $123 million for a limited number of special projects (especially in Alaska Native Villages and in communities on the U.S.-Mexico border). The Administration proposed to eliminate funds for unrequested infrastructure project spending that Congress had earmarked in the FY2002 law, which totaled $344 million. Also, the Administration requested no funds for the municipal sewer overflow grants program enacted in 2000. Some Members of Congress criticized the request level for clean water SRF capitalization grants, which was $138 million below the FY2002 enacted amount. In August 2002, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved an FY2003 funding bill for EPA that would provide $1.45 billion for clean water SRF grants, $100 million more than the FY2002 level ( S. 2797 , S.Rept. 107-222 ). In addition, the Senate committee bill included $875 million for drinking water SRF grants, $140 million for special needs infrastructure grants specified in report language, $45 million for Alaska Rural and Native Village project grants, $75 million for U.S.-Mexico border projects, and $1.134 billion for state categorical program grants, which could address a range of environmental programs. The House Appropriations Committee approved its version of an FY2003 funding bill with $1.3 billion for the clean water SRF program ( H.R. 5605 , H.Rept. 107-740 ) in October. This bill also included $850 million for drinking water SRF grants, $227.6 million for special needs infrastructure grants enumerated in report language, $35 million for Alaska Rural and Native Village project grants, $75 million for U.S.-Mexico border projects, and $1.173 billion for state categorical program grants, which could address a range of environmental programs. Neither appropriations committee included funds for the sewer overflow grant program authorized in 2000 (the Administration did not request FY2003 funds for these grants). Due to complex budgetary disputes during the year, final action did not occur before the 107 th Congress adjourned in November 2002, and it extended into 2003, more than five months after the start of the fiscal year. Congress and the President reached agreement on funding levels for EPA and other nondefense agencies in an omnibus appropriations act ( P.L. 108-7 ; H.J.Res. 2 , H.Rept. 108-10 ), which the President signed on February 20. The EPA portion of the enacted bill included $1.34 billion for clean water SRF grants, $844 million for drinking water SRF grants, and $413 million more for 489 special water infrastructure project grants to individual cities specified in conference report language, plus projects in Alaska Native Villages and communities on the U.S.-Mexico border. It also provided a total of $1.14 billion for categorical state grants, which generally support states and tribal implementation of a range of environmental programs. On February 3, 2003, before completion of the FY2003 appropriations, President Bush submitted his budget request for FY2004. It requested a total of $1.798 billion for water infrastructure funds, consisting of $850 million for clean water SRF grants, $850 million for drinking water SRF grants, and $98 million for priority projects (especially in Alaska Native Villages and in communities on the U.S.-Mexico border). As in previous years, the Administration requested no funds for congressionally earmarked project grants for individual communities. Some Members of Congress and interest groups criticized the request for clean water SRF grants ($490 million below the FY2003 enacted level), but Administration officials responded by saying that the request reflected a commitment to fund this program at the $850 million level through FY2011. Funding at that level and over that long-term period, plus repayments of previous SRF loans made by states, would be expected to increase the revolving levels of the overall program from $2.0 billion to $2.8 billion per year, the Administration said. The President's budget also requested $1.2 billion for categorical state grants, which could address a range of environmental programs. On July 25, the House approved H.R. 2861 ( H.Rept. 108-235 ), providing FY2004 appropriations for EPA. As passed, the bill included $1.2 billion for clean water SRF grants, $850 million for drinking water SRF grants, $203 million for earmarked water infrastructure project grants, and $75 million in grants for high-priority projects in Alaska Native Villages and along the U.S.-Mexico border. Senate action on its version of a funding bill for EPA ( S.Rept. 108-143 ) occurred on November 18. The Senate-passed bill provided $1.35 billion for clean water SRF grants, $850 million for drinking water SRF grants, $130 million for targeted infrastructure project grants, plus $95 million in grants for projects in Alaska Native Villages and along the U.S.-Mexico border. As with the previous year's appropriations, Congress did not enact legislation providing FY2004 funds for EPA before the beginning of the new fiscal year; thus EPA programs were covered by a series of continuing resolutions (CRs). The last of these CRs ( P.L. 108-135 ) extended FY2003 funding levels through January 31, 2004. On December 8, 2003, the House passed legislation providing full-year funding for EPA and other agencies that lacked enacted appropriations ( H.R. 2673 ). The conference report on this bill ( H.Rept. 108-401 ) provided $1.34 billion for clean water SRF grants, $845 million for drinking water SRF grants, and $425 million in grants for 520 earmarked grants in listed communities, Alaska Native Villages, and U.S.-Mexico border projects. The Senate approved the conference report on January 22, 2004, and President Bush signed the legislation January 23 ( P.L. 108-199 ). The FY2005 EPA appropriation for water infrastructure funds was the lowest total for these programs since FY1997 (the first year in which Congress provided both clean water and drinking water SRF capitalization grants, as well as earmarked project grants). The decline was due primarily to a reduction in funding for the clean water SRF program from an average of $1.35 billion since FY1998 to $1.09 billion. President Bush's FY2005 budget, presented February 2, 2004, requested a total of $3.0 billion for water infrastructure assistance and state environmental program grants. It included $850 million for clean water SRF grants, $850 million for drinking water SRF grants, $94 million for priority projects (primarily in Alaska Native Villages and along the U.S.-Mexico border), and $1.25 billion for categorical grants, which could address a range of environmental programs. As in recent budgets, the Administration requested no funds for congressionally earmarked project grants. Anticipating that critics likely would focus on the clean water SRF request ($492 million below the FY2004 level), in its budget documents the Administration said that the request included funding for the clean water SRF at $850 million annually through 2011, which, together with loan repayments, state matches, and other funding sources, would result in a long-term average revolving level of $3.4 billion. Likewise, the budget anticipated funding the drinking water SRF program at the same $850 million annually through 2011, resulting in a long-term average revolving level of $1.2 billion. House and Senate Appropriations committees began review of the EPA budget request in March. On September 9, 2004, the House Appropriations Committee reported FY2005 funding for EPA in a bill that included the Administration's requested level of $850 million for clean water SRF grants, $850 million for drinking water SRF grants, and earmarked grants for priority water infrastructure projects totaling $393.4 million ( H.R. 5041 , H.Rept. 108-674 ). On September 21, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported its version of this bill ( S. 2825 , S.Rept. 108-353 ), which included $1.35 billion for clean water SRF grants, $850 million for drinking water SRF grants, and $217 million for earmarked project grants. Final action on the FY2005 appropriation did not occur before the start of the fiscal year. On November 20, the House and Senate passed H.R. 4818 ( H.Rept. 108-792 ), the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005, an omnibus appropriations bill comprising nine appropriations measures, including funding for EPA. The bill provided total funding for EPA of $8.1 billion, a decrease from the $8.4 billion approved in FY2004, but $340 million more than was requested by the President in February. One of the most controversial items in the final bill was a $251 million decrease for clean water SRF grants from the FY2004 level, although the $1.09 billion total was $241 million more than in the President's budget. The final measure also included $843 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants; $401.7 million for 669 earmarked grants in listed communities, Alaska Native Villages, and U.S.-Mexico border projects; and $1.14 billion for categorical state grants, which generally support state and tribal administration of a range of environmental programs. The $2.34 billion total for water infrastructure programs and projects was $542 million more than was requested by the President, but $276 million less than Congress appropriated for FY2004. President Bush signed the legislation December 8, 2004 ( P.L. 108-447 ). The FY2006 appropriation for water infrastructure funds marked the second consecutive year in which Congress appropriated less funding for these programs, providing lower levels both for clean water SRF capitalization grants and for earmarked project grants than in FY2005. President Bush presented the FY2006 budget request in February 2005. Overall for EPA, it sought 5.6% less than Congress had appropriated for FY2005. The Administration's deepest cuts affecting EPA were proposed for the STAG account. The budget requested $730 million for clean water SRF grants (33% below FY2005 appropriated funding and 45.6% below the FY2004 level), $850 million for drinking water SRF grants (a slight increase from the FY2005 level), $69 million for priority projects (primarily in Alaska Native Villages and along the U.S.-Mexico border), and $1.2 billion for state categorical grants, which could address a range of environmental programs. As in previous years, the Administration requested no funds for congressionally earmarked water infrastructure projects. Advocates for the SRF programs (especially state and local government officials) contended that cuts to the clean water program would impair their ability to carry out needed municipal wastewater treatment plant improvement projects. Administration officials responded that the proposed SRF reductions for FY2006 were because Congress had boosted funds above the FY2005 request level. These officials said that the Administration planned to invest $6.8 billion in the clean water SRF program between FY2004 and FY2011, after which federal funding was expected to end, and the state SRFs were expected to have an annual revolving level of $3.4 billion. If Congress appropriated more than requested in any given year (as occurred in FY2005), they said, that target would be met sooner, leading to reduced requests for the SRF in subsequent years until a planned phaseout in FY2011. On May 19, 2005, the House passed H.R. 2361 , providing FY2006 funding for EPA. As passed, it provided $850 million for clean water SRF grants ($120 million more than the President's request), $850 million for drinking water SRF grants, and $269 million for earmarked water infrastructure grants. During debate, the House rejected two amendments to increase clean water SRF funding. On June 29, the Senate passed its version of H.R. 2361 , providing $1.1 billion for clean water SRF grants, $850 million for drinking water SRF grants, and $290 million for earmarked project grants. The House bill required that $100 million of the SRF funding come from balances from expired contracts, grants, and interagency agreements from various EPA appropriation accounts. The Senate bill, in contrast, called for a $58 million rescission of unobligated amounts associated with grants, contracts, and interagency agreements in various accounts, but did not specify that such monies go to SRF funding. Conferees resolved differences between the bills ( H.Rept. 109-188 ), and the House and Senate approved the measure in July; the President signed it into law on August 2 ( P.L. 109-54 ). As enacted, the bill provided $900 million for clean water SRF grants; $850 million for drinking water SRF grants; $285 million for 259 earmarked grants in listed communities, Alaska Native Villages, and along the U.S.-Mexico border; and $1.13 billion for categorical state grants, which could address a range of environmental programs. The final bill required an $80 million rescission from expired grants, contracts, and interagency agreements in various EPA accounts (not just the STAG account) not obligated by September 1, 2006. It did not direct the rescinded funds to be applied to the clean water SRF, as proposed by the House. The $2.03 billion total in the bill for EPA water infrastructure programs and projects was $386 million more than was requested by the President, but $301 million less than Congress appropriated for FY2005. Further, the funding amounts specified in P.L. 109-54 were reduced slightly. First, a provision of P.L. 109-54 , Section 439, mandated an across-the-board rescission of 0.476% for any discretionary appropriation in that bill. Second, in December 2005 Congress enacted P.L. 109-148 , the FY2006 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, and Section 3801 of that bill mandated a 1% across-the-board rescission for discretionary accounts in any FY2006 appropriation act (except for discretionary authority of the Department of Veterans Affairs). As a result of these two rescissions, the final levels for the STAG account were $887 million for clean water SRF grants; $838 million for drinking water SRF grants; $281 million for 259 earmarked grants in listed communities, Alaska Native Villages, and along the U.S.-Mexico border; and $1.11 billion for categorical state grants, which could address a range of environmental programs. FY2006 EPA water infrastructure programs and projects thus total $2.0 billion. On October 28, President Bush requested that Congress rescind $2.3 billion from 55 ""lower-priority federal programs and excess funds,"" including $166 million from clean water SRF monies. In the end, Congress did not endorse the specific request to reduce clean water SRF appropriations. The two rescissions resulting from P.L. 109-54 and P.L. 109-148 totaled a $13.2 million reduction from the $900 million specified in the EPA appropriations act. President Bush presented the Administration's FY2007 budget request in February 2006, asking Congress to appropriate $1.570 billion for EPA's water infrastructure programs. The FY2007 request sought $687.6 million for clean water SRF grants, $841.5 million for drinking water SRF grants, and $40.6 million for special projects in Alaska Native Villages, Puerto Rico, and along the U.S.-Mexico border. When the 109 th Congress adjourned in December 2006, it had not completed action on appropriations legislation to fund EPA (or on nine other appropriations bills covering the majority of domestic discretionary agencies and departments) for the fiscal year that began October 1, 2006, thus carrying over this legislative activity into the 110 th Congress. In December 2006, Congress enacted a continuing resolution, P.L. 109-383 (the third such continuing resolution since the start of the fiscal year on October 1), providing funds for EPA and the other affected agencies and departments until February 15, 2007. The President's FY2007 budget request for clean water SRF capitalization grants was 22% less than the FY2006 appropriation for these grants and 37% below the FY2005 funding level. The request for drinking water SRF grants was essentially the same as in recent years ($4 million more than FY2006, $1.7 million less than FY2005). As in recent budgets, the Administration proposed no funding for congressionally designated water infrastructure grants, but, as noted above, it did seek a total of $40.6 million for Administration priority projects. Advocates of the clean water SRF program (especially state and local government officials) again contended, as they have for several recent years, that the cuts would impair their ability to carry out needed municipal wastewater treatment plant improvement projects. Administration officials responded that cuts for the clean water SRF in FY2007 were necessary because Congress boosted funds above the requested level in FY2005 and FY2006. On May 18, 2006, the House passed H.R. 5386 ( H.Rept. 109-465 ), providing the requested level of $687.6 million for clean water SRF grants and $841.5 million for drinking water SRF grants. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the same funding levels for these grant programs when it reported H.R. 5386 on June 29 ( S.Rept. 109-275 ), but the Senate did not act on this measure before the 109 th Congress adjourned in December. Before adjournment, Congress enacted a continuing resolution (CR), P.L. 109-383 (the third such CR since the start of the fiscal year on October 1), providing funds for EPA and the other affected agencies and departments until February 15, 2007. Funding levels provided under this CR followed a ""lowest level"" concept for individual programs; that is, programs were funded at the lowest level under either House-passed FY2007 appropriations, Senate-passed appropriations, or the FY2006 funding. For clean water SRF grants, the resulting appropriation through mid-February was $687.6 million, as in House-passed H.R. 5386 . For drinking water SRF grants, the appropriation level through mid-February was $837.5 million, the FY2006-enacted level. The CR included funds for congressionally earmarked water infrastructure project grants totaling $200 million, as in House-passed H.R. 5386 . Returning to these issues in 2007, in mid-February, Congress passed H.J.Res. 20 , a continuing appropriations resolution that provides funding for EPA and the other affected agencies through the end of FY2007. As passed, this full-year resolution held most programs and activities at their FY2006 appropriated levels. However, clean water SRF capitalization grants were one of the few programs that received a funding increase under the resolution: these grants received $1.08 billion ($197 million more than in FY2006, and $396 million more than the President requested for FY2007). The resolution further prohibited project grants for congressional earmarks, but not for special project grants requested in the President's budget. The action to ban earmarks in FY2007 occurred when leaders in the 110 th Congress sought to finish up appropriations actions that were unresolved at the end of the 109 th Congress, and at the same time the newly elected Congress moved to adopt rules and procedures to reform the congressional earmarking process for the future. (Water infrastructure project earmarks totaled $281 million in EPA's FY2006 appropriation.) President Bush signed H.J.Res. 20 on February 15, 2007 ( P.L. 110-5 ). The final FY2007 amounts provided in P.L. 110-5 were $1.084 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants, $837.5 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants, $83.75 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border project grants requested by the Administration, and $1.11 billion for categorical state grants, which could be used to administer a range of environmental programs. President Obama presented his FY2008 budget request to Congress on February 5, 2007, before finalization of the FY2007 appropriations. The budget sought $687.6 million for clean water SRF grants, the same amount requested for FY2007; $842.2 million for drinking water SRF grants; $25.5 million for special project grants for Alaska Native Villages and the U.S.-Mexico border region; and $1.065 billion for categorical state grants, which could address a range of environmental programs. In June 2007, the House passed H.R. 2643 , providing FY2008 appropriations for EPA. This bill included $1.125 billion for clean water SRF grants, $842.2 million for drinking water SRF grants, plus $175.5 million for 143 congressionally designated water infrastructure project grants. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved companion legislation ( S. 1696 ) that similarly included higher funding levels for several water quality programs. The Senate committee's bill provided less funding for clean water SRF grants than the House bill ($887 million), the same amount for drinking water SRF grants, and slightly more for congressionally designated water infrastructure project grants ($180 million). The Senate did not take up S. 1696 . By October 1, the start of FY2008, Congress had not enacted any appropriations bills for FY2008, and Congress enacted several short-term continuing appropriations resolutions to temporarily fund EPA and other government agencies until final agreement, which occurred in December 2007. Full-year funding for EPA's water infrastructure programs was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 (Division F, Title II), signed by the President December 26, 2007 ( P.L. 110-161 ). The final FY2008 amounts provided in this legislation were $689.1 million for clean water SRF capitalization grants ($1.5 million more than requested by the Administration), $829.0 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants ($13.2 million less than requested), $177.2 million for 282 earmarked grants in listed communities, Alaska Native Villages, and U.S.-Mexico border projects ($151.7 million more than requested), and $1.078 billion for categorical state grants ($13.3 million more than requested), which could address a range of environmental programs. President Obama presented his FY2009 budget request to Congress on February 6, 2008. The budget sought $555 million for clean water SRF grants, $134 million less than Congress appropriated for FY2008; $842.2 million for drinking water SRF grants, $13 million more than was appropriated for FY2008; $25.5 million for special project grants for Alaska Native Villages and the U.S.-Mexico border region, $18.8 million less than was appropriated for FY2008; and $1.057 billion for categorical state grants, which could address a range of environmental programs. As in past years, the budget requested no funds for other earmarked grants. In June 2008, a House Appropriations subcommittee approved a bill with FY2009 funding for EPA, but no further action occurred before the start of the fiscal year. At the end of September 2008, Congress and the President agreed to legislation providing partial-year funding for EPA and most other agencies and departments. This bill, the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Resolution Act, 2009 ( P.L. 110-329 ), provided funding through March 6, 2009, at FY2008 funding levels. A second short-term continuing resolution was enacted on March 6 ( P.L. 111-6 ), while Congress was finishing consideration of a full-year omnibus FY2009 appropriations bill that the President signed on March 11 ( P.L. 111-8 ). The omnibus bill provided $689 million in regular appropriations for clean water SRF grants, $829 million for drinking water SRF grants—both at the same levels as were appropriated in FY2008—and $1.094 billion for categorical state grants, which support administration of a range of environmental programs. The omnibus appropriations act also includes $183.5 million for earmarked water infrastructure grants. In February 2009, Congress responded to the nation's economic crisis by enacting the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ), legislation providing FY2009 supplemental appropriations to a number of government programs. Part of the philosophy underlying the legislation was the concept of using federal investments to make accelerated investments in the nation's public infrastructure in order to create jobs while also meeting infrastructure needs. To that end, the legislation included $4.0 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants (for total FY2009 funds of $4.689 billion) and $2.0 billion for drinking water SRF capitalization grants (for total FY2009 funds of $2.829 billion). The supplemental SRF funds were available for obligation through FY2010, but under the legislation, states were to give preference when awarding funds to activities that can start and finish quickly, with a goal that at least 50% of the funds go to activities that can be initiated within 120 days of enactment. States were to give priority to wastewater projects that could proceed to construction within 12 months of enactment, and funds for projects that were not under contract or under construction by February 12, 2010, would be reallocated by EPA to other states. Further, the legislation required states to reserve at least 20% of the SRF capitalization grant funds for a Green Project Reserve, that is, projects intended to achieve improved energy or water efficiency. It also specified that all assistance agreements made in whole or in part with funds appropriated under the ARRA must comply with prevailing wage requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act. President Obama presented his Administration's FY2010 budget request on May 7, 2009. For EPA as a whole, the budget sought $10.5 billion, a 38% increase above levels enacted in EPA's regular FY2009 appropriations ( P.L. 111-8 ). The bulk of the increase in the President's budget was for water infrastructure assistance, which would receive 157% above FY2009 levels (excluding ARRA supplemental funds). The request included $2.4 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants; $1.5 billion for drinking water SRF capitalization grants; $20 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border projects; and $1.111 billion for state categorical grants (1.5% above FY2009 levels), which generally support state administration of environmental programs. Congress provided FY2010 appropriations for EPA in P.L. 111-88 , passed by the House and Senate in October 2009 and signed into law on October 30. In this measure, Congress provided the following: $2.1 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants; $1.387 billion for drinking water SRF capitalization grants; $186.7 million for 319 congressionally earmarked special project grants, including assistance for Alaska Native Villages and U.S.-Mexico border projects; and $1.116 billion for state categorical environmental grants, which could address a range of environmental programs. The FY2010 appropriations act included some restrictions that Congress also had specified in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, discussed above, namely a requirement that 20% of SRF capitalization grant assistance be used for ""green"" infrastructure and also that Davis-Bacon Act prevailing wage rules shall apply to construction of wastewater or drinking water projects carried out in whole or in part with assistance from the SRF. President Obama presented the FY2011 budget request in February 2010. For EPA as a whole, the budget sought $10.02 billion in discretionary budget authority, a 3% decrease from levels enacted for EPA in FY2010. The largest component of the reduced request, compared with FY2010, was $200 million less for grants to capitalize clean water and drinking water SRF programs. In explaining the request, EPA budget documents noted that even with a slight reduction, the budget ""continues robust funding for the SRFs."" As in past years, the President requested no funds for congressionally designated water infrastructure projects. The request included $2.0 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants; $1.287 billion for drinking water SRF capitalization grants; $20 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border projects; and $1.277 billion for state categorical grant programs (14% higher than the FY2010 enacted amount), which could address a range of environmental programs. Congress took only limited action on FY2011 funding for EPA before the start of the new fiscal year on October 1, 2010: a House Appropriations subcommittee approved a bill in July, but no further action followed. At the end of September, the House and Senate passed a continuing resolution to extend FY2010 funding levels for EPA and other federal agencies and departments until December 3, 2010, because no FY2011 appropriations bills had been enacted by October 1. President Obama signed the continuing resolution (CR) on September 30 ( P.L. 111-242 ). This bill was followed by six more short-term CRs before Congress came to final resolution of FY2011 spending on April 14, 2011, enacting a bill to provide funding for EPA and all other federal agencies and departments through September 30 ( P.L. 112-10 ). The final bill reduced overall funding for EPA 15% below the FY2010 level. The enacted bill included $1.522 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants; $963.1 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants; $19.96 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S. Mexico-border projects; and $1.254 billion for state categorical grant programs, which generally support implementation of a range of environmental programs. Policymakers began to consider the budget for FY2012 before finalizing the funding levels for FY2011. The President submitted the Administration's FY2012 budget request on February 14, 2011. It sought $9 billion total for EPA, a decrease of $1.3 billion from the FY2010 enacted level, but 3% higher than the FY2011 enacted level. The President's request included $1.55 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants, $990 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants, $20 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border assistance, and $1.2 billion for state categorical grants, which could address a range of environmental programs. For several days in July 2011, the House debated H.R. 2584 , providing FY2012 appropriations for EPA, but did not take final action on the bill before the August recess. As reported, the bill provided $7.3 billion for EPA, 17% less than FY2011 funds and 19% less than the President's FY2012 request. It reduced funds for the clean water SRF capitalization grants to $689 million and $829 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants (the same levels provided in FY2008), while including no funds for congressionally designated special projects (i.e., earmarks). The reported bill also provided $1.002 billion for state categorical grants, which could address a range of environmental programs. There was no action on this bill in the Senate. Final congressional action on FY2012 appropriations for EPA and most other federal agencies and departments did not occur until the end of December 2011, enacted in an omnibus appropriations act, P.L. 112-74 . The enacted bill included $1.466 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants (3.7% below FY2011); $917.9 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants (4.7% below FY2011); $14.976 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border projects; and $1.089 billion for state categorical grants, which could address a range of environmental programs. President Obama presented the Administration's FY2013 budget request in February 2012. It sought $8.34 billion overall for EPA, or 4.7% below the level enacted for FY2012. The request included $1.175 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants, $850 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants, $20 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border assistance, and $1.2 billion for state categorical grants, which could address a range of environmental programs. The total amount requested for SRF capitalization grants is 15% below the FY2012 enacted level, reflecting a 20% reduction for the clean water program and a 7.4% reduction for the drinking water program. The House Appropriations Committee approved legislation providing FY2013 funds for EPA in July 2012 ( H.R. 6091 ). As reported, the bill provided $689 million for clean water SRF capitalization grants (the same level provided in FY2008), $829 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants, $994 million for state categorical grants, and no funds for Alaska Native Village or U.S.-Mexico border projects. The House did not take up H.R. 6091 , nor did the Senate act on an EPA appropriations bill (although the Senate Appropriations Committee released a draft bill in September 2012). Prior to the start of FY2013 on October 1, 2012, Congress passed and the President signed a continuing resolution bill providing funding for government agencies and departments through March 27, 2013 ( P.L. 112-175 ). This measure funded the government generally at FY2012 levels plus a 0.6% increase. Final action on FY2013 appropriations occurred in the Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 ( P.L. 113-6 ). Funding enacted in this bill included $1.452 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants; $908.7 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants; $15 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border assistance; and $1.1 billion for state categorical grants, which generally support state and tribal implementation of a range of environmental programs. However, these amounts were reduced under the March 1, 2013, sequester order of the President, which reduced affected accounts by 5.0%, and by an across-the-board rescission of 0.2% necessary to avoid exceeding the FY2013 discretionary spending limits in law. After these reductions, available FY2013 funding was approximately $1.38 billion for the clean water SRF capitalization grants, $860 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants, $14 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border assistance, and $1.0 billion for state categorical grants. President Obama presented the Administration's FY2014 budget in April 2013. It sought $8.15 billion overall for EPA, including $1.095 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants, $817 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants, $15 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border projects, and $1.136 billion for state categorical grants. The total amount requested for SRF capitalization grants was 19% below the FY2013 enacted level. In mid-2013, the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies drafted a bill (unnumbered) that would have reduced overall funding for EPA by 34% from the FY2013 enacted level, including an 83% reduction for clean water SRF capitalization grants (the bill would have provided $250 million) and a 65% reduction for drinking water SRF capitalization grants ($350 million was included in the bill). According to subcommittee documents, the reduction was appropriate because, despite recent federal support, little progress has been made to reduce the known water infrastructure gap. The full committee did not complete markup of this bill. The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies drafted an alternative bill that would have maintained funding for the clean water SRF program at $1.45 billion and funding for the drinking water SRF program at $907 million. There was no further action on this bill. Congress did not reach final agreement on FY2014 appropriations before the start of the fiscal year on October 1, but did agree to a short-term continuing appropriations measure ( P.L. 113-46 ), which provided funding through January 15, 2014. Final action on appropriations for EPA and all other federal agencies and departments occurred as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 ( H.R. 3547 , P.L. 113-76 ), signed by the President on January 17, 2014. This bill provides $1.45 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants (5% more than FY2013 funds and 32% higher than the President's FY2014 budget request) and $907 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants (5% more than FY2013 funds and 11% higher than the President's FY2014 budget request). The bill also provides $15 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border assistance, and $1.0 billion for state categorical grants, which generally support state and tribal implementation of a range of environmental programs. President Obama presented the Administration's FY2015 budget on March 4, 2014. It sought $7.89 billion overall for EPA, including $1.018 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants, $757 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants, $15 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border projects, and $1.13 billion for state categorical grants. The total amount requested for SRF capitalization grants was 25% below the FY2014 enacted level. Final full-year appropriations were enacted as part of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, enacted in December 2014 ( P.L. 113-235 ). The legislation provided the same water infrastructure funding levels as in FY2014: $1.45 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants and $907 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants. As with the FY2014 appropriations, the bill provided $15 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border assistance and $1.0 billion for state categorical grants, which could address a range of environmental programs. The Administration's FY2016 budget requested $8.6 billion overall for EPA. The request included $1.116 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants, $1.186 billion for drinking water SRF capitalization grants (31% higher than the FY2016 appropriation), $15 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border projects, and $1.162 billion for state categorical grants, which generally support state and tribal implementation of a range of environmental programs. Although the House and Senate Appropriations Committees reported bills to provide FY2016 appropriations for EPA, final appropriations action for EPA and other agencies occurred as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, signed by the President December 18, 2015 ( P.L. 114-113 ). The bill provided $1.394 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants ($55 million less than FY2015, but $278 million above the President's request), $863 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants ($44 million below the FY2015 level, and $323 million less than the President's request), and $30 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border water infrastructure projects. It also provided $1.06 billion for state categorical grants. President Obama presented the Administration's FY2017 budget in February 2016, requesting $8.3 billion in total for EPA ($127 million above the FY2016 enacted budget). The request for EPA included $979.5 million for clean water SRF capitalization grants ($424 million less than the FY2016 enacted level), $1.02 billion for drinking water SRF capitalization grants ($157 million above the FY2016 amount), $22 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border projects, and $1.158 billion for state categorical grants, which generally support state and tribal implementation of environmental programs. During congressional hearings on the EPA request, many Members criticized the requested 30% decrease in funds for clean water SRF capitalization grants. This criticism was reflected to some degree in appropriations bills the Appropriations Committees subsequently approved that include EPA funding. In July 2016, the House passed H.R. 5538 , FY2017 Interior and Environment Appropriations Act; it included $1.0 billion for clean water SRF grants, $1.07 billion for drinking water SRF grants, and $1.06 billion for state categorical grants. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a companion bill, S. 3068 , in June. It included $1.35 billion for clean water SRF grants, $1.02 billion for drinking water SRF grants, and $1.09 billion for state categorical grants. The Senate did not take up this bill. Congress did not reach final agreement on an EPA funding bill before the start of FY2017. However, on September 28, the House and Senate passed a 10-week continuing resolution that extended FY2016 funding levels, minus a 0.496% across-the-board reduction, through December 9, 2016 ( P.L. 114-223 ). A second continuing resolution, passed in December 2014, extended FY2016 funding levels, minus a 0.1901% across-the-board reduction, from December 10, 2016, through April 28, 2017 ( P.L. 114-254 ). The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget submission also included a $15 million request to allow EPA to begin making water infrastructure project loans under a program that Congress enacted in 2014, the Water Infrastructure Financing and Investment Act, or WIFIA. P.L. 114-254 included the first appropriation, $20 million, for EPA to do so. The FY2017 final appropriations act (discussed below) provided an additional $8 million for EPA's WIFIA program (and $2 million for EPA to administer the program). Final full-year appropriations were enacted as part of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2017, signed by President Trump on May 5, 2017 ( P.L. 115-31 ). The act provided the same level of funding for water infrastructure as FY2016: $1.394 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants ($414 million above President Obama's request), $863 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants ($158 million less than President Obama's request), and $30 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border water infrastructure projects. It also provided $1.07 billion for state categorical grants, which support a range of environmental programs. The Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017 ( P.L. 114-254 ), included an additional $100 million in DWSRF funding to assist Flint, MI, as authorized in the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation (WIIN) Act ( P.L. 114-322 ). The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request proposed $8.6 billion overall for EPA. The request included $1.394 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants and $863 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants (the same amounts as the FY2017 appropriation). The request proposed $597 million for state categorical grants, a 44% reduction compared to FY2017 levels. Much of this reduction came from the elimination of funding for nonpoint source grants (CWA Section 319) and reduction of grant funding for water pollution control (CWA Section 106). In addition, the President's budget request proposed to eliminate funding for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border projects. Similar to the previous fiscal year, Congress did not reach final agreement on an EPA funding bill before the start of FY2018. EPA and other federal departments and agencies operated under multiple continuing resolutions generally at FY2017 enacted levels (minus across-the-board rescissions). Final full-year appropriations were enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, signed by President Trump on March 23, 2018 ( P.L. 115-141 ). EPA's STAG account (Division G, Title II) included $1.394 billion for the clean water SRF and $863 million for the drinking water SRF program (the same amounts appropriated for FY2017, less $100 million for the DWSRF provided to assist Flint, MI). Division G, Title IV (General Provisions), Section 430, included an additional $600 million ($300.0 million each) within the STAG account for both SRF programs. P.L. 115-141 also provided $63 million for the WIFIA program, more than doubling the FY2017 appropriation. The act provided $20 million for Alaska Native Village projects and $10 million U.S.-Mexico border projects. It also provided $1.08 billion for state categorical grants, which support a range of environmental programs. In addition, the act provided the first appropriations for three programs authorized in the WIIN Act ( P.L. 114-322 , Title II, the Water and Waste Act of 2016): $10 million to help public water systems serving small or disadvantaged communities meet SDWA requirements; $20 million to support lead reduction projects, including lead service line replacement; and $20 million to establish a voluntary program for testing for lead in drinking water at schools and child care programs. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request proposed $6.15 billion overall for EPA. The request included $1.394 billion for clean water SRF capitalization grants and $863 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants (the same amounts requested in FY2018). The request included $20 million for the WIFIA program: $17 million to cover subsidy costs, which EPA estimated would allow the agency to lend approximately $2 billion (EPA Budget Justification), and $3 million for administrative costs. In addition, the request proposed $597 million for state categorical grants and $3 million for Alaska Native Village projects. The request proposed to eliminate funding for nonpoint source grants (CWA Section 319), reduce grant funding for water pollution control (CWA Section 106), and eliminate funding for U.S.-Mexico border water infrastructure projects. At the beginning of FY2019, EPA operated under the terms and conditions of multiple continuing resolutions (Division C of P.L. 115-245 ; P.L. 115-298 ; and P.L. 116-5 ). A ""partial government shutdown"" began on December 22, 2018, during which EPA operated under its shutdown contingency plans. Final full-year appropriations were enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ), signed by President Trump on February 15, 2019. FY2019 appropriations were provided in two titles of P.L. 116-6 . Title II included $1.394 billion for the CWSRF, $864.0 million for the DWSRF, and $10.0 million for WIFIA. Title IV included an additional $600.0 million ($300.0 million each) for both SRF programs and an additional $58.0 million for WIFIA. Title IV of P.L. 116-6 included $65.0 million within the EPA STAG account for grants authorized in the WIIN Act ( P.L. 114-322 ): $25 million to help public water systems serving small or disadvantaged communities meet SDWA requirements, $15 million to support lead reduction projects (including lead service line replacement), and $25 million to establish a voluntary program for testing for lead in drinking water at schools and child care programs. In addition, the act provided $25 million for Alaska Native Village projects and $15 million U.S.-Mexico border projects. It also provided $1.08 billion for state categorical grants, which support a range of environmental programs. The Trump Administration's FY2020 budget request proposed $6.07 billion overall for EPA. The request included $1.120 billion for CWSRF capitalization grants; $863 million for drinking water SRF capitalization grants; $25 million for the WIFIA program: $20 million to cover subsidy costs, which EPA estimated would allow the agency to lend over $2 billion (EPA Budget Justification), and $5 million for administrative costs; $3 million for Alaska Native Village projects; $10 million for testing for lead in drinking water at schools and child care programs; $61 million for sewer overflow control grants; $154 million for water pollution control grants (CWA Section 106); and $580 million for state categorical grants, which support a range of environmental programs. The Administration's request proposed to eliminate funding for the following: nonpoint source grants, U.S.-Mexico border water infrastructure projects, drinking water grants for small and disadvantage communities, and lead reduction project grants.\n\n","['The principal federal program to aid municipal wastewater treatment plant construction is authorized in the Clean Water Act (CWA). Established as a grant program in 1972, it now capitalizes state loan programs through the clean water state revolving loan fund (CWSRF) program. Since FY1972, appropriations have totaled $98 billion. In 1996, Congress amended the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA, P.L. 104-182) to authorize a similar state loan program for drinking water to help systems finance projects needed to comply with drinking water regulations and to protect public health. Since FY1997, appropriations for the drinking water state revolving loan fund (DWSRF) program have totaled $23 billion. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administers both SRF programs, which annually distribute funds to the states for implementation. Funding amounts are specified in the State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG) account of EPA annual appropriations acts. The combined appropriations for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure assistance have represented 25%-32% of total funds appropriated to EPA in recent years. Prior to CWA amendments in 1987 (P.L. 100-4), Congress provided wastewater grant funding directly to municipalities. The federal share of project costs was generally 55%; state and local governments were responsible for the remaining 45%. The 1987 amendments replaced this grant program with the SRF program. Local communities are now often responsible for 100% of project costs, rather than 45%, as they are required to repay loans to states. The greater financial burden of the act\'s loan program on some cities has caused some to seek continued grant funding. Although the CWSRF and DWSRF have largely functioned as loan programs, both allow the implementing state agency to provide ""additional subsidization"" under certain conditions. Since its amendments in 1996, the SDWA has authorized states to use up to 30% of their DWSRF capitalization grants to provide additional assistance, such as forgiveness of loan principal or negative interest rate loans, to help disadvantaged communities. America\'s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 (AWIA; P.L. 115-270) increased this proportion to 35% while conditionally requiring states to use at least 6% of their capitalization grants for these purposes. Congress amended the CWA in 2014, adding similar provisions to the CWSRF program. In addition, appropriations acts in recent years have required states to use minimum percentages of their allotted SRF grants to provide additional subsidization. Final full-year appropriations were enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2019 (P.L. 116-6), on February 15, 2019. The act provided $1.694 billion for the CWSRF and $1.163 billion for the DWSRF program, nearly identical to the FY2018 appropriations. The FY0219 act provided $68 million for the WIFIA program, a $5 million increase from the FY2018 appropriation. Compared to the FY2019 appropriation levels, the Trump Administration\'s FY2020 budget request proposes to decrease the appropriations for the CWSRF, DWSRF, and WIFIA programs by 34%, 26%, and 63%, respectively.']","18229","gov_report","en","None","cbdd4b937972c65f6d9de2ef403bbacbc169a5155ecef22a","Summary:","gov_report","532","\n\nThe Clean Water Act (CWA) is aka Water Quality Act, is a federal law in the United States, which was enacted in 1972, to protect the nation's water resources.

"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nMany consumer products—such as deodorants, shaving products, and hair care products—are differentiated to appeal specifically to men or women through differences in packaging, scent, or other product characteristics (see fig. 1). These differences related to gender can affect manufacturing and marketing costs that may contribute to price differences in products targeted to different genders. However, firms may also charge consumers different prices for the same (or very similar) goods and services even when there are no differences in costs to produce. To maximize profits, firms use a variety of techniques to charge prices close to the highest price different consumers are willing to pay. Firms may attempt to get segments of the consumer market to pay a higher price than another segment by slightly altering or differentiating the product. Based on the differentiated products, consumers self-select into different groups according to their preferences and what they are willing to pay. For example, some consumer goods have different versions of what is essentially the same product—except for differences in packaging or features, such as scent—with one version intended for women and another version intended for men. The two products may be priced differently because the firm expects that one gender will be willing to pay more for the product than the other based on preference for certain product attributes. Firms may also use some group characteristic, such as age or gender, to charge different prices because some groups may have differences in willingness or ability to pay. For example, a firm may offer discounted movie tickets to students or seniors, as they may have less disposable income. For the seller the cost of providing the movie is the same for any customer, but the seller is able to maximize its profits by offering tickets to different groups of customers at different prices. A firm’s ability to differentiate prices depends on multiple factors, such as the firm’s market power (so that competitors cannot put downward pressure on prices to eliminate the price differences), the presence of consumer segments with different demands and willingness to pay, and control over the sale of its product so it cannot be easily resold to exploit price differences. In addition, the extent to which consumers pay different prices for the same or similar goods can depend on other factors, such as consumers’: willingness to purchase an item they believe may be priced higher for ability to compare prices and product characteristics and choose a product based on its characteristics rather than its price, choices about whether to purchase a more expensive version of the product (e.g., a branded item versus a cheaper store brand), choices about where to purchase the item (i.e., when different retailers sell the same item at different prices), and use of coupons or promotions. No federal law expressly prohibits businesses from charging different prices for the same or similar consumer goods and services targeted to men and women. However, consumer protection laws do prohibit sex discrimination in credit and real estate transactions. Specifically, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants based on sex or certain other characteristics and the Fair Housing Act (FHA) prohibits discrimination in the housing market on the basis of sex or certain other characteristics. ECOA and FHA (collectively known as the fair lending laws) prohibit lenders from, among other things, refusing to extend credit or using different standards in determining to extend credit based on sex. Credit, such as a credit card account or mortgage loan, is generally made available and priced based on a number of risk factors, including credit score, income, and employment history. A borrower with a lower credit score is likely to pay a higher interest rate on a loan, reflecting the greater risk to the lender that the borrower could default on the loan. In addition to the interest rate, borrowing costs for consumers can also include fees and other costs charged by lenders or brokers. However, there may be differences in average outcomes for men and women—such as for availability of credit or interest rates—if there are differences related to gender in the factors that determine creditworthiness, such as income. BCFP, FTC, the federal prudential regulators, and DOJ have the authority to investigate alleged violations of ECOA and are primarily responsible for enforcing the act’s requirements, while HUD and DOJ share responsibility for enforcing the provisions of FHA. Further, BCFP and the prudential regulators oversee regulated entities for compliance with ECOA by, among other things, collecting complaints from the public and through routine inspections of the financial institutions they oversee. HUD and DOJ have the authority to bring enforcement actions for alleged violations of FHA. In 5 out of 10 product categories we analyzed, personal care products targeted to women sold at higher average prices than those targeted to men after controlling for certain observable factors. For 2 of the 10 product categories, men’s versions sold at higher average prices. While the factors we controlled for likely proxy for various costs and consumer preferences, we could not fully observe all underlying differences in costs and demand for products targeted to different genders. As a result, we could not determine the extent to which the gender-based price differences we observed may be attributed to gender bias as opposed to other factors. Women’s versions of personal care products sold at a statistically significant higher average price than men’s versions for 5 of the 10 personal care product categories we analyzed—using two different price measures and after controlling for observable factors that could affect price, such as brands, product size or quantity, promotional expenses (see table 1) and other product-specific attributes (e.g., scent, special claims, form). Because women’s and men’s versions of the same product were frequently sold in different sizes, we compared prices using two price measures: average item price and average price per ounce or count of product. For 2 of the 10 product categories—shaving gel and nondisposable razors—men’s versions sold at a statistically significant higher price using both price measures. For one category (razor blades), women’s versions sold at a statistically significant higher average price per count, but there was no gender price difference using average item prices. Additionally, for two product categories—disposable razors and mass-market perfumes—there were no statistically significant price differences between men’s and women’s products using either price measure. In addition to this analysis of retail price scanner data, we also manually collected advertised online prices for a limited selection of personal care products targeted to women and men from several online retailers. Some price comparisons of advertised online prices for men’s and women’s versions of a product were similar to comparisons of average prices paid based on the Nielsen retail price scanner data. For example, for three pairs of comparable underarm deodorants, the women’s deodorant was listed at a higher price per ounce on average than the men’s deodorant (see app. II). In addition, for one pair of shaving gel products we analyzed, the men’s shaving gel was listed at a higher price per ounce on average. However, for both pairs of nondisposable razors we analyzed, the women’s razors were listed at a higher average price per count than the men’s razors. This contrasted with the Nielsen data showing that men’s nondisposable razors sold at higher prices on average than women’s. An important limitation of our analysis of these advertised prices is that we were unable to determine the extent to which consumers actually paid these prices and in what volume the products were sold, and our results are not generalizable to the broader universe of prices for these products sold at other times or by other online retailers. Though we found that the target gender for a product is a significant factor contributing to price differences we identified, we do not have sufficient information to determine the extent to which these gender- related price differences were due to gender bias as opposed to other factors. Versions differentiated to appeal to men and women can result in different costs for the manufacturer. Our econometric analysis controlled for many observable factors related to costs, such as product size, promotional activity, and packaging type. We also controlled for many product attributes such as forms, scents, and special claims that products make to account for underlying manufacturing cost differences. In addition, we controlled for brands, which can reflect consumer preferences. However, we do not have firm-level data on all cost differences—for example, those related to advertising and packaging. As a result, we could not determine the extent to which the price differences we observed may be explained by remaining cost differences between men’s and women’s products. We also do not have the data to determine the extent to which men and women have different demands and willingness to pay for a product, which would be expected to affect the prices firms charge for differentiated products. For example, some academic experts we spoke with said that women may value some product attributes, such as design and scent, more than men do. If products differentiated to incorporate those attributes do not result in different costs, then differences in prices could be part of a firm’s pricing strategy based on the willingness of one gender to pay more than another. The conditions necessary for firms to be able to implement a strategy of price differentiation likely exist for the personal care products we analyzed. First, our analysis suggests that due to industry concentration, there is limited market competition for the 10 personal care products we analyzed. With more market power, firms can more easily set different prices for different consumer segments. Second, firms have the ability to segment the market for personal care products by tailoring product characteristics related to gender, such as by labeling the product as women’s deodorant or men’s deodorant, or by altering scent or colors. Third, while men and women are able to freely purchase a product targeted to the opposite gender, certain factors may limit the extent to which this occurs. For example, some product differences such as scents may discourage one gender from buying products targeted to another gender. In addition, consumers may find it difficult and time- consuming to compare prices for similar men’s and women’s products because of the ways they are differentiated (such as product size and scents) and because they may be sold in different parts of a store. We reviewed studies that compared prices for men and women in four markets where the product or service is not differentiated by gender: mortgages, small business credit, auto purchases, and auto repairs. First, we reviewed studies on mortgage and small business credit that analyzed interest rates and access to credit to identify any differences for men and women. Second, we reviewed studies that compared prices quoted to men and women in auto purchase and repair markets. However, several of these studies have important limitations, such as using nonrepresentative data samples, and the results are not generalizable. Studies we reviewed found that women as a group pay higher interest rates on average than men in part due to weaker credit characteristics. After controlling for borrower credit characteristics and other factors, three studies did not find statistically significant differences in interest rates between men and women for the same type of mortgage, while one study found that women paid higher mortgage rates for certain subprime loans. In addition, one study found that female borrowers defaulted less frequently on their loans than male borrowers with similar credit characteristics, suggesting that women as a group may pay higher mortgage rates than men relative to their default risk. While these studies attempted to control for factors other than gender or sex that could affect borrowing costs, several lacked important data on certain borrower risk characteristics. For example, several studies we reviewed rely on Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 (HMDA) data, which did not include data on risk factors such as borrower credit scores that could affect analysis of disparities between men and women. Also, several studies analyzed nonrepresentative samples of loans, such as subprime loans or loans originated more than 10 years ago, which limits the generalizability of the results (see table 2). Three of the studies we reviewed found that while women on average were charged higher interest rates on mortgage loans than men, this difference was not statistically significant after controlling for other factors. For example, one study found that differences in mortgage interest rates between men and women became insignificant after controlling for differences in how men and women shop for mortgage rates. The authors used data from the 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) to analyze the effect on interest rates of mortgage features, borrower characteristics such as gender, and market conditions. However, their analysis did not include data on some borrower credit characteristics such as credit score and debt-to-income ratio that could affect borrowing costs. Another study found that women were charged higher interest rates for subprime loans made in 2005, but once the authors controlled for observed risk characteristics there was no evidence of disparity in interest rates by gender of the borrower in the subprime market. However, the authors’ data did not include any fees paid at loan origination, which could affect the overall cost of borrowing. A third study that examined disparities between men and women in subprime loans found no significant evidence that gender affected the cost of borrowing within the subprime market, though it did find that women—particularly African American women—were more likely to have subprime loans. The authors found that, even after controlling for some financial characteristics and loan terms, single African American women were more likely than non-Hispanic white couples to have subprime loans. One study analyzed subprime loans made by one large lender from 2003 through 2005 and found that women paid more for subprime mortgages than men after controlling for some risk factors. This study found that women had higher average borrowing costs—as measured by annual percentage rate—than men, and controlling for credit characteristics such as credit scores and debt-to-income ratios did not fully explain the differences. However, the authors did not control for other factors that could also affect borrowing costs, such as differences in education, shopping behaviors, and geographic location. Additionally, a research paper found that female-only borrowers—that is, where the only borrower is a woman—default less than male-only borrowers with similar loans and credit characteristics. The authors found that female-only borrowers on average pay more for their mortgage loans because they generally have weaker credit characteristics, such as lower income, and also because a higher percentage of these mortgage loans are subprime. However, after controlling for credit characteristics such as credit score, loan term, and loan-to-value ratio, among others, the analysis showed that these weaker credit characteristics do not accurately predict how well women pay their mortgage loans. Since pricing is tied to credit characteristics and not performance, women may pay more relative to their actual risk than do similar men. Studies we reviewed on small business loans generally did not find differences in interest rates, though some found differences in denial rates and other accessibility issues between female- and male-owned firms. Most of the studies we reviewed used data from the 1993, 1998, or 2003 Survey of Small Business Finances (SSBF), which could limit the applicability or relevance of their findings today. A study that analyzed data from the 1993 SSBF did not find evidence that businesses owned by women paid more for credit than firms owned by white men. However, when the authors took into account the market concentration and competition, they found that white female-owned firms experienced increased denial rates in less competitive markets. In addition, the study found that women may avoid applying for credit in those markets because of the fear of being denied. For example, almost half of all small business owners who needed credit reported that they did not apply for credit, and these rates were even higher for businesses owned by women and minorities. Other studies found that women may have less access to small business credit than men, in part because of higher denial rates and because they may not apply for credit out of fear of rejection. For example, one study found that women-owned firms have higher loan denial rates compared with men; however, this is mainly due to differences in business characteristics of female- and male-owned firms. The authors also found that even when denial rates are the same for small businesses with similar characteristics, women’s loan application rates are lower, suggesting that women may be discouraged from applying for credit by the higher overall denial rates for female-owned firms. Another study by one of the same authors examined the reasons why female borrowers may be discouraged from applying for a business loan compared to male business owners and found that it was mainly because they fear that their application will be rejected. A third study by the same author found that women in general did not have less access to credit than men, though newer female-owned firms received significantly lower loan amounts than requested compared to their male-owned counterparts. Similarly, the study also found that women with few years of experience managing or owning a business received significantly lower loan amounts compared with men with similar years of experience. A fourth study looked at six different types of loans, including lines of credit, and found that white women were significantly more likely than white men to avoid applying for a loan because they assume they would be denied. However, once the authors’ model controlled for education differences, all gender disparities in applying for credit disappeared, though white women were still less likely than white men to have loans. Studies we reviewed on auto purchases and repairs found that a seller’s expectation of what customers are willing to pay and how informed they seemed can differ by gender, which can affect the price customers are quoted. However, these studies were published in 1995 and 2001, which may limit the applicability or relevance of their findings today. The 2001 study we reviewed on auto purchases found that though women paid higher prices than men for car purchases on average, these differences declined when cars were purchased online. The authors suggest that this may be because Internet consumers can effectively convey their level of price knowledge and therefore may seem better informed to the sellers. They also suggest it could be because the dealerships have less information about online consumers and their willingness to pay, which may limit the extent of price differentiation. The 1995 study on auto purchases found that the dealers quoted significantly lower prices to white males than to female or African American test buyers using identical, scripted bargaining strategies in part because dealers may have made assumptions about women’s willingness to bargain for lower prices. We also reviewed one study on auto repairs that found that women were quoted higher prices than men if they seemed uninformed about the cost of car repair when requesting a quote, but the price differences disappeared if the study participant mentioned an expected price. The study suggests that a potential explanation for this result could be that auto repair shops expect women to accept a price that is higher than the market average and men to accept a price below it. BCFP and HUD have responsibilities to monitor consumer complaints in the consumer credit and housing markets, respectively. Additionally, FTC monitors complaints about the consumer credit and consumer goods markets. All three agencies play a role in potentially monitoring or addressing issues of gender-related price differences and have online complaint forms for submission of consumer complaints: BCFP collects and reviews consumer complaints about financial products and services and provides complaints and related data in its Consumer Complaint Database. In 2017 BCFP received approximately 320,200 consumer complaints. The products that generated the most complaints in 2017 were “Credit or consumer reporting,” “Debt collection,” and “Mortgage."" According to BCFP officials, BCFP also analyzes loan and demographics data collected through HMDA and other data sources to monitor and identify market trends. In addition, BCFP and the federal financial regulators examine fair lending practices of the institutions they regulate, and these examinations have uncovered sex discrimination in credit products by FDIC and NCUA. FTC receives complaints and the complaints are stored in the Consumer Sentinel Network, a database of consumer complaints received by FTC, as well as those filed with other federal and state agencies and organizations, such as mass marketing fraud complaints from the Council of Better Business Bureaus. The complaints in the Consumer Sentinel Network focus on consumer fraud, identity theft, and other consumer protection matters, such as debt collection, and can include complaints related to consumer credit markets. HUD receives consumer complaints about potential FHA violations through its website, via its toll-free phone hotline, and in writing. HUD monitors those complaints through its online HUD Enforcement Management System. HUD investigates all complaints for which it has jurisdictional authority. HUD may monitor complaints to identify trends, but HUD officials stated that the agency does not generally monitor consumer credit and housing market data, absent a specific complaint. In cases where HUD has jurisdictional authority under FHA, HUD offers conciliation between the parties. If resolution is not reached, and HUD determines there is reasonable cause to believe a violation has occurred, the parties may elect to have the matter heard in U.S. District Court or at HUD. In their oversight of federal antidiscrimination statutes, BCFP officials said they have not identified significant consumer concerns about price differences based on a consumer’s sex or gender. FTC and HUD officials identified some examples of concerns of this nature. For example, FTC has taken enforcement actions alleging unlawful race- and gender-related price differences. HUD has also identified several cases where pregnant women and their partners applied for a mortgage while the woman was on maternity leave, and the couple’s mortgage loan application was denied. BCFP, FTC, and HUD have received few consumer complaints about price differences related to sex or gender, according to our analysis of a sample of each agency’s 2012–2017 complaint data (see table 3). In separate samples of 100 gender-related complaints at BCFP, HUD, and FTC, we found that 0, 4, and 1 complaint, respectively, were related to price differences based on sex or gender. Three of the complaints from HUD also cited differences in price based on other protected classes (such as race or ethnicity). Half of the academic experts and consumer groups we interviewed told us that in some markets it is difficult for consumers to observe and compare prices paid by other consumers, such as when prices are not posted or can be negotiated (e.g., car sales). In such cases, consumers may not know if other consumers are paying a higher or lower price than the price quoted to them. Most academic experts also told us that when consumers are aware that price differences could exist, they may make different decisions when making purchases. Additionally, officials from BCFP noted that price differences related to gender may be difficult for consumers to identify, or that consumers may not know where to complain. The consumer education resources of BCFP, FTC, and HUD provide general consumer education resources on discrimination (i.e., consumer user guide or a website) and consumer awareness. Officials from BCFP and HUD said they have not identified a need to develop other consumer education resources specific to gender-related price differences. For example, BCFP’s print and online consumer education materials are intended to inform consumers of their rights and protections related to credit discrimination, which includes discrimination based on sex or gender. The three agencies’ consumer education materials also provide advice that could help consumers avoid paying higher prices regardless of their gender—such as home-buying resources and resources on comparison shopping. However, the agencies have not developed additional educational resources focused specifically on potential gender- related price differences in part because few complaints on this topic have been collected in their databases, agency officials told us. FTC officials noted that it tries to focus its education efforts on topics that will have the greatest benefit to consumers, often determined by information it gathers through complaints and investigations. Representatives of five consumer groups and industry associations told us that they have received few complaints about gender-related price differences. However, four consumer groups noted that low concern could be the result of consumers being unaware of price differences related to gender. For example, as indicated above, price differences related to gender may be difficult for consumers to identify when they cannot determine whether they are paying a higher price than others. Representatives of two retailing industry associations similarly stated that they have not heard concerns about price differences related to gender. In response to consumer complaints or concerns about gender disparities in pricing, at least one state (California) and two municipalities (Miami- Dade County and New York City) have passed laws or ordinances to prohibit businesses from charging different prices for the same or similar goods or services solely based on gender (see table 4). In addition, two of these laws included requirements related to promoting price transparency. California enacted the Gender Tax Repeal Act of 1995, which prohibits businesses from charging different prices for the same or similar services based on a consumer’s gender. The law also requires certain businesses to display price information and disclose prices upon request, according to state officials with whom we spoke. Similarly, in 1997, Miami-Dade County passed the Gender Pricing Ordinance, which prohibits businesses from charging different prices based solely on a consumer’s gender (though businesses are permitted to charge different prices if the goods or services involve more time, difficulty, or cost). In the same year, it also passed an ordinance that prohibits dry cleaning businesses from charging different prices for similar services based on gender. This ordinance also requires those businesses to post all prices on a clear and conspicuous sign, according to county officials with whom we spoke. State and local officials we interviewed identified benefits and challenges associated with these laws. For example, California, New York City, and Miami-Dade County officials noted that these laws give them the ability to intervene to address pricing practices that may lead to discrimination based on gender. In addition, California state officials said that the state’s efforts to implement the Gender Tax Repeal Act helped to improve consumer awareness about gender price differences. However, officials from California and Miami-Dade County cited challenges associated with tracking relevant complaints. For example, Miami-Dade County’s online complaint form includes a narrative section but does not ask for the complainant’s gender. Consumers do not always identify their gender in the narrative or state that that was the reason for their treatment. Additionally, officials from California and Miami-Dade County stated that seeking out violations would be very resource-intensive, and they rely on residents to submit complaints about violations. We provided a draft of this report to BCFP, DOJ, FTC, and HUD. BCFP, FTC, and HUD provided technical comments on the report draft, which we incorporated where appropriate. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to the appropriate congressional committees, BCFP, DOJ, FTC, HUD, and other interested parties. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-8678 or cackleya@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix VI. We used a multivariate regression model to estimate the effect of gender (to which a product is targeted to) on the price of that product while controlling for other factors that may also affect the product’s price. The factors that we controlled for were the product size, promotional and packaging costs, and other product characteristics discussed in detail later. We used scanner data from the Nielsen Company (Nielsen) for calendar year 2016 and analyzed the following 10 product categories: (1) underarm deodorants, (2) body deodorants, (3) shaving cream, (4) shaving gel, (5) disposable razors, (6) nondisposable razors, (7) razor blades, (8) designer perfumes, (9) mass-market perfumes, and (10) mass-market body sprays. We estimated the following regression model for each of our 10 product categories: P=α+β*Male + λ* Size + θ*Owner +η*Promotion+ μ*X + δ*Y + ε The dependent variable P in the above equation represents price. For our analysis, we constructed two measures of price. The first is the item price, estimated as the total dollar sales of an item (each item is depicted by a unique Universal Product Code (UPC) in the Nielsen data), divided by the total units sold of that item. The second measure of price that we use is price per ounce or price per count. This is estimated as the item price divided by the total quantity of product, where quantity or size depicts the number of ounces (as in the case of fragrances) or the count of blades in razor blade packs. The total quantity of the product is the ounces or counts of one item multiplied by the number of items included in a specific product configuration. For example, a 2-pack of deodorant sticks where each deodorant stick is 2.7 ounces would be a total quantity of 5.4 ounces. The variable Male in the above equation is an indicator variable depicting whether the product is designated as a “men’s” product in the Nielsen data. It is represented as a value of “1” for men’s products and a value of “0” for women’s products. The co-efficient for this variable, parameter β, would therefore show the price difference between a men’s and women’s product. A negative value would imply a lower price for products designated as men’s products. The variable Size represents the most appropriate specification of the size of the product. Owner is a set of indicator variables representing all the brand owners selling a particular product. The brand of a product can be expected to have a substantial effect on prices for the kind of products we analyze because brands can be a proxy for quality for some consumers. However, we also found that firms often create gender-specific brands, so holding brands constant rendered most gender-based price comparisons infeasible. To overcome this, we hold owners instead of brands constant for our price comparison analysis. The variable Promotion represents the percentage of dollar sales that were sold on any type of promotion. This variable proxies for promotional costs to some extent based on the assumption that the greater the proportion of sales due to promotional activity, the greater the promotional costs. The variables X represent a set of indicator variables for packaging characteristics such as package delivery method (for example, roll-on or aerosol spray deodorants) or package shape (for example, bottle, tube, or can). We expect these characteristics to proxy for different costs associated with different packaging methods. The variables Y represent a set of indicator variables representing different product characteristics (for example, forms such as gel stick or smooth solid and claims such as “active cooling” or “anti-wetness” for underarm deodorants, and blade types such as “triple edge” and “flexible six” for razors). These product characteristics may proxy for some underlying manufacturing costs or even consumer preferences. Since firms may create gender-specific product attributes—scents like “sweet petals” and “pure sport” or razor head types and colors to differentiate products between genders—we did not always keep every product attribute constant when comparing prices. The idiosyncratic error term is represented by ε. All of our regressions are weighted, with the proportion of units sold for a particular item in that year as the weight. This is because, for personal care products, there are large differences in units sold of various product types and brands, and therefore it not useful to compare simple un- weighted average prices. For example, for one company the highest selling men’s deodorant stick sold almost 12 million units in 2016, and the highest selling women’s deodorant stick sold over 8 million units. The average units sold for underarm deodorants as a whole was just over 300,000 units, and 1,000 products out of a total of almost 3,000 products had less than 100 units sold in 2016. The linear model we used has the usual shortcomings of being subject to specification bias to the extent the relationship between price and each of the independent variables is not linear. The model also does not include complete data on costs, such as advertising and packaging, or consumers’ willingness to pay, both of which have an effect on the price differences. The model may thus also be subject to omitted variable bias. In addition, the model may have some endogeneity issues to the extent the product characteristics themselves are influenced by consumers’ willingness to pay for some of those product features. To reduce the impact of any model misspecifications or heteroscedasticity, we used the robust (or Huber-White sandwich) estimator. We estimated the regression model above for each of the 10 products separately and for each of the two measures of price. We used Nielsen’s in-store, retail price scanner data, which include information on total volume sold and dollar sales for items purchased at 228 retailers including grocery stores, drug stores, mass merchandisers (such as Target), dollar stores, club stores (such as Sam’s Club), and convenience stores. The data capture 82 percent of all U.S. sales. Nielsen also projects sales for the remaining noncooperating retailers, and that information is included in this dataset. We excluded some very small brands that did not have enough units sold from our regression analysis in order to avoid outliers. These brands usually had less than 50,000 units sold over the entire year, and for some products they represented less than 1 percent of all units sold. We found that average retail prices paid were significantly higher for women’s products than for men’s in 5 out of 10 personal care products. In 2 categories, men’s versions sold at a significantly higher price. One category had mixed results based on two price measures analyzed, and two others showed no significant gender price differences. A summary of our regression results is presented in table 5. We manually collected prices for 16 pairs of selected personal care products from the websites of four online retailers that also operated physical store locations. We selected comparable pairs of similar men’s and women’s products that were differentiated by product attributes, such as scent or color, and were sold at most or all of the four retailers. The products were selected based on several comparability factors such as brand, product claims, and number of blades in a razor. For two 1-week time periods in January and March 2018, we collected prices manually between 1:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. (ET) over two 7-day time periods. We collected listed prices and did not adjust the prices for any promotions that were available, such as online coupons or buy-one-get-one-free offers. Table 6 presents the results of our online price collection. These results have important limitations: The average prices shown are not generalizable to the broader universe of prices for these products sold at other times or by other online retailers. The data reflect prices advertised to consumers rather than the prices consumers actually paid. The data do not capture the volume of sales for each item for each retailer; in our analysis, we weighted all advertised prices equally across the retailers. As a result, differences we found within these advertised prices may not have translated into comparable differences in prices female and male consumers paid for these products online. The prices do not reflect any promotional discounts, volume discounts, or other discounts that may have been available to some or all consumers. This report examines (1) how prices compared for selected categories of consumer goods that are differentiated for men and women, and potential reasons for any significant price differences; (2) what is known about the extent to which men and women may pay different prices in, or experience different levels of access to, markets for credit and goods and services that are not differentiated based on gender; (3) the extent to which federal agencies have identified and taken steps to address any concerns about gender-related price differences; and (4) state and local government efforts to address concerns about gender-related price differences. To compare prices for selected goods that are differentiated for men and women, we purchased and analyzed Nielsen Company (Nielsen) data on retail prices paid for 10 personal care product categories for calendar year 2016. The product categories included underarm deodorants, body deodorants (typically sold as a spray), disposable razors, nondisposable razors, razor blades, shaving creams, shaving gels, and three categories of fragrances. We selected these categories of personal care products because they are commonly purchased consumer goods that were categorized by gender in the Nielsen data. The women’s and men’s versions of personal care products we selected are generally more similar in terms of the form, size, and packaging in comparison to certain other consumer product categories that are also differentiated by gender, such as clothing. We used regression models to analyze data on retail prices paid for the 10 categories of personal care products differentiated for women and men. To assess the reliability of the Nielsen data, we reviewed relevant documentation and conducted interviews with Nielsen representatives to review steps they took to collect and ensure the reliability of the data. In addition, we electronically tested data fields for missing values, outliers, and obvious errors. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. For more details on the methodology for, and limitations of, our analysis of these retail price data, see appendix I. We also manually collected listed prices for 16 pairs of selected personal care products from four different retailer websites over two 7-day periods in January and March 2018. For each pair, we selected comparable men’s and women’s products that were differentiated by product attributes, such as scent or color, and were commonly sold across retailers. For more details on our online price data collection and the limitations associated with interpreting the results, see appendix II. To examine what is known about the extent to which men and women may be offered different prices or access for the same goods or services, we reviewed academic literature identified through a literature search covering the last 25 years. To identify existing studies from peer-reviewed journals, we conducted searches using subject and keyword searches of various databases, such as EconLit, Scopus, ProQuest, and Social SciSearch. We also used a snowball search technique—meaning we reviewed relevant academic literature cited in our selected studies—to identify additional studies. We performed these searches and identified articles from December 2016 to April 2018. From these searches, we identified 21 studies that appeared in peer-reviewed journals or research institutions’ publications from 1995 through 2016 and were relevant to gender-related price differences for the same products. We reviewed and assessed each study’s evaluation methodology based on generally accepted social science standards. See the bibliography at the end of this report for a list of the 21 studies. We then summarized the research findings. A GAO economist read and assessed each study, using the same data collection instrument. The assessment focused on information such as the types of disparities examined, the research design and data sources used, and methods of data analysis. The assessment also focused on the quality of the data used in the studies as reported by the researchers and any limitations of data sources for the purposes for which they were used. A second GAO economist reviewed each completed data collection instrument to verify the accuracy of the information included. As a result, the 21 studies that we selected for our review met our criteria for methodological quality. We found the studies we reviewed to be reliable for purposes of determining what is known about price differences for the same products. However, these studies have important limitations, such as using nonrepresentative data samples, and the results are not generalizable. To examine the federal role in overseeing gender-related price differences, we reviewed relevant federal statutes and agency guidance, and interviewed officials from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (BCFP), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the Department of Justice (DOJ). To help identify the extent of concerns about gender-related price differences, we interviewed representatives from eight consumer groups, three industry associations, and four academic experts. Additionally, we reviewed a sample of consumer complaints from databases managed by BCFP, FTC, and HUD (Consumer Complaint Database, Consumer Sentinel Network, and Enforcement Management System, respectively). Complaints were submitted by consumers across the United States about various financial products, housing grievances, and other consumer protection concerns. To identify our universe of gender-related consumer complaints in BCFP and FTC databases, we used the following search terms that targeted sex or gender discrimination: discriminat, unfair, treat, decept, abus, female, woman, women, man, men, male, gender, sex, female, woman, women, man, men, male, gender, and sex. HUD’s consumer complaint database is categorized by protected class (e.g., race, sex, national origin), so we did not need to use search terms to identify gender-related complaints. For the years 2012 through 2017, we identified 6,117 BCFP consumer complaint narratives; 10,472 FTC consumer complaints narratives; and 5,421 HUD consumer complaint narratives that were relevant to our scope. We then drew a stratified random probability sample of 100 gender-related consumer complaints from each database. To determine which complaints in our samples were about price differences related to gender or sex, two team members read through each complaint narrative and coded whether or not the complainant’s narrative indicated that they felt that they paid or were charged more because of their gender or sex. A third team member conducted a final review of the results, and made a final determination in cases where there were differences in the first two team member’s assessments. With this probability sample, each member of the study population had a nonzero probability of being included, and that probability could be computed for any member. We followed a probability procedure based on random selections and our sample is only one of a large number of samples that we might have drawn. Since each sample could have provided different estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our particular sample’s results as a 95 percent confidence interval (with a margin of error of 5.9 percent). This is the interval that would contain the actual population value for 95 percent of the samples we could have drawn. We assessed the reliability of these data by reviewing documentation and interviewing agency officials about the databases used to collect these complaints. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes of identifying complaints of gender- related price differences. To explore state and local efforts to address concerns about gender- related price differences, we conducted a literature search and identified three state or local laws or ordinances that specifically address gender- related price differences: California, Miami-Dade County, Florida, and New York City, New York. We reviewed these laws and ordinances and interviewed officials from these jurisdictions to discuss motivations for, oversight of, and the impact of these laws. We conducted this performance audit from October 2016 to August 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. For each of 10 personal care product categories we analyzed, we compared the overall average prices for women’s products and men’s products using two measures of average price: average item price and average price per ounce or count. While the second price measure adjusts the average price for quantity of product, these comparisons did not take into account the effect on price of differences in product brand, packaging, and other characteristics. As shown in table 7, adjusting the average item price to account for differences in product quantity (ounces or count) significantly affected the size and magnitude of gender price differences for several product categories. This is because men’s products in the dataset were frequently larger in size or count compared with women’s products in the same category. For example, women’s disposable razors sold for 11 percent less than those targeted to men when we compared average item prices. However, when we compared average price per count of razors, women’s disposable razors sold for 19 percent more on average than men’s. This is because women’s disposable razors had on average about one fewer razor per package. In 5 out of 10 product categories, women’s versions of the product on average sold for a higher price per ounce or count than men’s and these differences were statistically significant at the 95 percent confidence level for 4 products and at the 90 percent level for one product. Information about sales and relative sizes of different products targeted to men and women are presented in table 8 below. This appendix provides additional details about the consumer complaint processes at the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (BCFP), Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Consumers with a complaint about unfair treatment related to gender could submit a complaint to one of these agencies. BCFP and FTC monitor consumer complaints related to violations under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, while HUD and the Department of Justice (DOJ) investigate housing discrimination complaints under the Fair Housing Act. These complaints could be about price differences because of gender. Alicia Puente Cackley, (202) 512-8678 or cackleya@gao.gov.

While variation in costs and consumer demand may give rise to such price differences, some policymakers have raised concerns that gender bias may also be a factor. While the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Housing Act prohibit discrimination based on sex in credit and housing transactions, no federal law prohibits businesses from charging consumers different prices for the same or similar goods targeted to different genders. GAO was asked to review gender-related price differences for consumer goods and services sold in the United States. This report examines, among other things, (1) how prices compared for selected goods and services marketed to men and women, and potential reasons for any price differences; (2) what is known about price differences for men and women for products not differentiated by gender, such as mortgages; and (3) the extent to which federal agencies have identified and addressed any concerns about gender-related price differences. To examine these issues, GAO analyzed retail price data, reviewed relevant academic studies, analyzed federal consumer complaint data, and interviewed federal agency officials, industry experts, and academics. Firms differentiate many consumer products to appeal separately to men and women by slightly altering product attributes like color or scent. Products differentiated by gender may sell for different prices if men and women have different demands or willingness to pay for these product attributes. Of 10 personal care product categories (e.g., deodorants and shaving products) that GAO analyzed, average retail prices paid were significantly higher for women's products than for men's in 5 categories. In 2 categories—shaving gel and nondisposable razors—men's versions sold at a significantly higher price. One category—razor blades--had mixed results based on two price measures analyzed, and two others—disposable razors and mass-market perfumes—showed no significant gender price differences. GAO found that the target gender for a product is a significant factor contributing to price differences identified, but GAO did not have sufficient information to determine the extent to which these gender-related price differences were due to gender bias as opposed to other factors, such as different advertising costs. Though the analysis controlled for several observable product attributes, such as product size and packaging type, all underlying differences in costs and demand for products targeted to different genders could not be fully observed. Studies GAO reviewed found limited evidence of gender price differences for four products or services not differentiated by gender—mortgages, small business credit, auto purchases, and auto repairs. For example, with regard to mortgages, women as a group paid higher average mortgage rates than men, in part due to weaker credit characteristics, such as lower average income. However, after controlling for borrower credit characteristics and other factors, three studies did not find statistically significant differences in borrowing costs between men and women, while one found women paid higher rates for certain subprime loans. In addition, one study found that female borrowers defaulted less frequently than male borrowers with similar credit characteristics, and the study suggested that women may pay higher mortgage rates than men relative to their default risk. While these studies controlled for factors other than gender that could affect borrowing costs, several lacked important data on certain borrower risk characteristics, such as credit scores, which could affect analysis of gender disparities. Also, several studies analyzed small samples of subprime loans that were originated in 2005 or earlier, which limits the generalizability of the results. In their oversight of federal antidiscrimination statutes, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, Federal Trade Commission, and Department of Housing and Urban Development have identified limited consumer concerns based on gender-related pricing differences. GAO's analysis of complaint data received by the three agencies from 2012–2017 found that they had received limited consumer complaints about gender-related price differences. The agencies provide general consumer education resources on discrimination and consumer awareness. However, given the limited consumer concern, they have not identified a need to incorporate additional materials specific to gender-related price differences into their existing consumer education resources.""]","8377","gov_report","en","None","f9c3887bcf4a8492d37350d51247c096a94d6703bbdee13b","Summary:","gov_report","532","\n\nThe report examines the extent to which consumer products are differentiated for men and women, women, women in the United States.

"Now, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\n","You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nAccording to the National Inventory of Dams, as of January 2016 there are approximately 90,500 dams in the United States and about 2.5 percent of these (approximately 2,100 dams) are associated with hydropower projects. Hydropower projects are owned and operated by both non-federal entities—such as private utility companies, municipalities, and state government agencies—or federal government agencies—primarily the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) and the Bureau of Reclamation. Collectively, these dams associated with hydropower projects account for about 8 percent of the total electric generating capacity in the United States. Hydropower projects generally consist of one or more dams and other key components associated with hydroelectric power generation and water storage, and are uniquely designed to accommodate watersheds, geology, and other natural conditions present at the time of construction. These components include both those that allow operators to adjust reservoir water levels, such as spillways and gates, as well as those that produce and distribute electricity, such as transmission lines and powerhouses, among others. (See fig. 1.) The Federal Power Act provides for FERC’s regulatory jurisdiction over a portfolio of about 1,000 non-federal hydropower projects comprising over 2,500 dams. While FERC does not construct, own, or operate dams, it licenses and provides oversight of non-federal hydropower projects to promote their safe operation. Licensees are responsible for the safety and liability of dams, pursuant to the Federal Power Act, and for their continuous upkeep and repair using sound and prudent engineering practices. FERC officials in each of the agency’s five regional offices work directly with licensees to help ensure these projects comply with licenses and meet federal guidelines for dam safety. In addition, stakeholder groups such as the Association of State Dam Safety Officials can assist licensees in staying current on federal and state dam laws and regulations, dam operations and maintenance practices, and emergency action planning, among other things. FERC’s regulations, supplemented by its Operating Manual and Engineering Guidelines, establish a framework for its dam safety oversight approach. FERC’s Operating Manual provides guidelines for the FERC staff performing inspections that are aimed at ensuring that structures are safe, are being properly maintained, and are being operated safely. FERC’s Engineering Guidelines provides FERC staff and licensees with procedures and criteria for the review and analysis of license applications, project modification proposals, technical studies, and dam designs. For example, one chapter presents guidelines for FERC staff to use to determine the appropriateness and level of geotechnical investigations and studies for dams. The Engineering Guidelines states that every dam is unique and that safety analysis of each dam require that engineers apply technical judgement based on their professional experience. As part of FERC’s safety oversight approach, it assigns a hazard classification to each dam in accordance with federal guidelines that consider the potential human or economic consequences of the dam’s failure. The hazard classification does not indicate the structural integrity of the dam itself, but rather the probable effects if a failure should occur. Depending on the hazard classification, the extent of and the frequency of safety oversight activities can vary. Low hazard dams are those where failure —an uncontrolled release of water from a water-retaining structure—would result in no probable loss of human life but could cause low economic and/or environmental losses. Significant hazard dams are those dams where failure would result in no probable loss of human life, but could cause economic loss, environmental damage, or other losses. High hazard dams are those dams where failure would probably cause loss of human life. FERC has designed a multi-layered oversight approach that involves both independent and coordinated actions with dam owners and independent consultants. Key elements of this approach include ensuring licensees have a safety program in place, conducting regular safety inspections, reviewing technical analyses, and analyzing safety as a part of project relicensing. (See fig. 2.) Licensee’s dam safety program. According to FERC guidance, licensees have the most important role in ensuring dam safety through continuous visual surveillance and ongoing monitoring to evaluate the health of the structure. Beyond this expectation for continuous oversight, FERC requires licensees of high and significant hazard dams to have an Owner’s Dam Safety Program. FERC dam safety inspection. The dam safety inspection, also called operation inspection, is a regularly-scheduled inspection conducted by a FERC regional office project engineer primarily addressing dam and public safety. FERC’s Operating Manual establishes the frequency that a FERC engineer conducts dam safety inspections. Independent consultant inspection and potential failure mode analysis. FERC requires licensees to hire a FERC-approved independent consulting engineer to inspect and evaluate high hazard dams and certain types of dams above a certain height or size and submit a report detailing the findings. Additionally, FERC requires the licensee of a high or significant hazard dam to conduct a potential failure mode analysis. A potential failure mode analysis is an exercise to identify and assess all potential failure modes under normal operating water levels and under extreme conditions caused by floods, earthquakes, and other events. FERC relicensing of projects. FERC issues hydropower licenses for the construction of new hydropower projects, and reissues licenses for existing projects when licenses expire. Licensees may submit applications for a new license for the continued operation of existing projects as part of a process known as relicensing. During relicensing, in addition to the power and development purposes for which FERC issues licenses, FERC must evaluate safety, environmental, recreational, cultural, and resource development among other factors when evaluating projects, according to its guidance. In addition, FERC requires licensees to conduct various engineering studies related to dam performance in accordance with FERC safety requirements. Required engineering studies focus on dam performance as affected by hydrology, seismicity, and dam stability. Licensees may also produce engineering studies, such as a focused spillway assessment, for their own operations or at the request of FERC. We found, based on our analysis of the 42 dam safety inspections we reviewed, that FERC staff generally conducted and collected information from these inspections consistent with guidance in its Operating Manual. According to FERC’s Operating Manual, staff’s approach to conducting these inspections and collecting information is to include preparing for the inspection by reviewing documents, conducting a field inspection of the dam and associated project components, and discussing inspection findings with licensees and with FERC supervisors. Preparation for inspection: We found that FERC staff generally met document review requirements in preparation for safety inspections of the 42 dams we reviewed. (See table 1.) According to the Operating Manual, FERC staff are to review safety-related information contained in documents such as potential failure mode analyses and hazard potential classifications. For example, we found that staff documented their review of the most recent independent consultant inspection report and potential failure mode analysis for each of the 16 high hazard dams we reviewed. FERC staff told us that they generally used checklists when preparing for these inspections. For example, some of the staff told us they tailor the checklist included in the Operating Manual, based on the dam’s type, characteristics, and hazard classification. Additionally, for each of the dams in our sample, staff stated that they prepared for the inspection by reviewing prior inspection reports and recommendations. Field inspection: We found that FERC staff generally met requirements for reviewing project components and documenting their findings from field inspections of the 42 dams we reviewed. (See table 2.) According to the Operating Manual, FERC staff are to conduct visual inspections of the dam, typically alongside the licensee, to assess the dam and project components by observing their condition and identifying any safety deficiency or maintenance requirement. Also during the inspection, FERC staff are to compare current conditions of the dam and project components to those described in prior inspection reports, and as applicable, collect information on the licensee’s progress towards resolving deficiencies and maintenance issues that can affect safety. To assess safety, FERC staff we interviewed stated that they primarily rely on their engineering judgment. Inspection findings: According to our interviews with FERC staff from selected projects, we found that staff generally followed FERC guidance in discussing inspection findings with licensees and supervisors prior to preparing inspection reports to document their findings. According to the Operating Manual, following the dam safety inspection, FERC staff are to discuss the inspection with the licensee, giving direction on how to address any findings. Additionally, upon returning to the office, staff are to discuss inspection findings with their supervisors who may suggest additional actions. FERC staff are then to develop a dam safety inspection report that documents observations and conclusions from their pre-inspection preparation and their field inspection and identifies follow-up actions for the licensee. We found that FERC staff prepared inspection reports to document findings from the 42 dam safety inspections we reviewed. In response to inspection findings, FERC requires licensees to submit a plan and schedule to remediate any deficiency, actions that FERC staff then reviews, approves, and monitors until the licensees have addressed the deficiency. While we found that FERC staff conducted inspections and collected inspection findings consistently in the files we reviewed, FERC’s approach to recording information varies across its regions, thus limiting the usefulness of the information. FERC’s approach to recording inspection information relies on multiple systems to record inspection information and affords broad discretion to its staff on how to characterize findings, such as whether to track inspection findings as maintenance issues or as safety deficiencies. As related to systems for recording inspection information, FERC staff use the Data and Management System (DAMS), the Office of Energy Projects-IT (OEP-IT) system, as well as spreadsheets. In particular, according to FERC staff: Four out of FERC’s five regional offices use DAMS—which is primarily a workload tracking tool—to track plans and schedules associated with safety investigations and modifications as well as inspection follow-up items. FERC staff stated that since the inspection information in DAMS is recorded as narrative text in a data field instead of as discrete categories, sorting or analysis of the information is difficult. One regional office uses OEP-IT to track safety deficiencies while the system is more widely used across FERC to track licensees’ compliance with the terms and conditions of their licenses. Three out of FERC’s five regional offices also use spreadsheets and other tools that are not integrated with DAMS or OEP-IT to track inspection information and licensee progress toward resolving safety deficiencies. FERC staff said that use of these different systems to record deficiencies identified during inspections limits their ability to analyze safety information. For example, according to FERC officials, OEP-IT was not designed to track safety deficiency information and is not compatible with DAMS for use in tracking information on a national level. Furthermore, because spreadsheets and other tools are specific to the regional office in which they are used, FERC staff does not use the information they contain for agency-wide analysis. Concerning decisions on how to characterize inspection findings, FERC staff relies on professional judgment, informed by their experience and the Engineering Guidelines, to determine whether to track inspection findings as a safety deficiency or as a maintenance item, according to FERC officials. With input from their supervisors, FERC staff also determines what information to record and how to track the status of the inspection finding. For example, staff assigned to a dam at a FERC- licensed project in New Hampshire observed concrete deterioration on several parts of the dam and its spillway and asked the licensee to monitor all concrete surfaces, making repairs as necessary. According to staff we interviewed, regional staff and supervisors decided not to identify this as a deficiency to be tracked in DAMS because concrete deterioration is normal and to be expected in consideration of the area’s harsh winter weather. In contrast, staff assigned to a dam at a FERC- licensed project in Minnesota observed concrete deterioration on several parts of the project, including the piers and the powerhouse walls, and entered the safety item in DAMS as requiring repair by the licensee. FERC officials stated they are comfortable with the use of professional judgement to classify and address inspection findings because it is important to allow for consideration of the characteristics unique to each situation and how they affect safety. FERC’s approach to recording inspection information is inconsistent because FERC has not provided standard language and procedures about how staff should record and track deficiencies including which system to use. Federal standards for internal control state that agencies should design an entity’s information system and related control activities to achieve objectives and control risks. In practice, this means that an agency would design control activities—such as policies and procedures—over the information technology infrastructure to support the completeness, accuracy, and validity of information processing by information technology. FERC officials acknowledged that there are inconsistent approaches in where and how staff record safety deficiency information, approaches that limit the information’s usefulness as an input to its oversight. While the agency has not developed guidance, officials stated that FERC plans to take steps to improve the consistency of recorded information by replacing the OEP-IT system with a new system, tentatively scheduled for September 2018, that will have a specific function to track dam safety requirements. However, this new system will not replace the functions of DAMS, which FERC will continue to use to store inspection information. The two will exist as parallel systems with the eventual goal of the two systems’ sharing information. By developing standard language and procedures to standardize the recording of information collected during inspections, FERC officials could help ensure that the information shared across these systems is comparable, steps that would allow FERC to identify the extent of and characteristics associated with common safety deficiencies across its entire portfolio of regulated dams. Moreover, with a consistent approach to recording information from individual dam safety inspections, FERC will be positioned to proactively identify comparable safety deficiencies across its portfolio and to tailor its inspections towards evaluating them. While FERC uses inspection information to monitor a licensee’s efforts to address a safety deficiency for an individual dam, FERC has not analyzed information collected from its dam safety inspections to evaluate safety risks across the entire regulated portfolio of dams. For example, FERC has not reviewed inspection information to identify common deficiencies among certain types of dams. Federal standards for internal control state that agencies should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to their objectives. These standards note that one method for management to identify risks is the consideration of deficiencies identified through audits and other assessments. Dam safety inspections are an example of such an assessment. As part of such an approach, the agency analyzes risks to estimate their significance, which provides a basis for responding to the risk through specific actions. Furthermore, in our previous work on federal facilities, we have identified that an advanced use of risk management involving the ability to gauge risk across a portfolio of facilities could allow stakeholders to comprehensively identify and prioritize risks at a national level and direct resources toward alleviating them. FERC officials stated that they have not conducted a portfolio-wide analysis in part due to the inconsistency of recorded inspection data and because such an evaluation has not been a priority compared to inspecting individual dams. According to officials, the FERC headquarters office collects and reviews information semi-annually from each of its five regional offices on the progress of outstanding dam investigations and modifications in those regions. FERC’s review is designed to monitor the status of investigations on each individual dam but does not analyze risks across the portfolio of dams at the regional or national level. For example, officials from the New York Regional Office stated they do not perform trend analysis across the regional portfolio of dams under their authority, but they compile year-to-year data for each separate dam to show any progression or changes from previous data collected from individual dams. A portfolio-wide analysis could help FERC proactively identify safety risks and prioritize them at a national level. FERC officials stated that a proactive analysis of its portfolio could be useful to determining how to focus its inspections to alleviate safety risks, but it was not an action that FERC had taken to date. The benefits of a proactive analysis, for example, could be similar to those FERC derived from the analysis it conducted in reaction to the Oroville Dam incident. To conduct this analysis, FERC required 184 project licensees, identified by FERC regional offices as having spillways similar to the failed spillway at the Oroville Dam, to assess the spillways’ safety and capacity. According to FERC officials, these assessments identified 27 dam spillways with varying degrees of safety concerns. They stated that FERC’s spillway assessment initiative was a success because they were able to target a specific subgroup of dams within the portfolio and identify these safety concerns at 27 dam spillways. FERC officials stated that they are working with the dam licensees to address these safety concerns. A similar and proactive approach based on analysis of common deficiencies across the portfolio of dams under FERC’s authority could also help to identify any safety risks that may not have been targeted during the inspections of individual dams and prior to a safety incident. As directed by FERC, licensees and their consultants develop and review, or update, various engineering studies related to dam performance to help ensure their dams meet FERC requirements and remain safe. FERC regulations and guidelines describe the types and frequency of studies and analyses required based on dams’ hazard classifications. For all high hazard and some significant hazard dams, existing studies are to be reviewed by each licensee’s consultants every 5 years, as part of the independent consultant inspection and accompanying potential failure mode analysis. According to FERC officials, for those significant hazard dams that do not require an independent consultant inspection and for low hazard dams, FERC’s regulations and guidelines do not require any studies, but in practice FERC directs many licensees to conduct them. FERC also may request engineering studies in response to dam safety incidents at other projects, or engage a board of consultants to oversee the completion of a study. For example, as previously noted, following the Oroville Dam incident in 2017, FERC requested a special assessment of all dams with spillways similar to the failed spillway at the Oroville Dam. To develop these studies, all six of the consultants we interviewed stated that they follow guidelines provided by FERC and other dam safety agencies. Specifically, they stated that they use FERC’s Engineering Guidelines, which provide engineering principles to guide the development and review of engineering studies. In recognition of the unique characteristics of each dam, including its construction, geography, and applicable loading conditions, the Guidelines provides consultants with flexibility to apply engineering judgment, and as a result, the approach that licensees and their consultants use and the focus of their reviews of engineering studies may vary across regions or projects. For example, one independent consultant we interviewed noted that seismicity studies are not highlighted during the independent consultant inspections for projects in the Upper Midwest in comparison to projects in other areas of the country because the region is not seismically active, but that inspections do look closely at ice loads during the winter months. To create these studies, we found that licensees and their consultants generally use data from other federal agencies and rely on available modeling tools developed by federal agencies and the private sector to evaluate dam performance. For example, many of the engineering studies we reviewed rely on data from the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to estimate precipitation patterns and the U.S. Geological Survey to estimate seismic activity. In addition, licensees and their consultants use modeling tools and simulations, such as those developed by the Corps to estimate hydrology, to develop engineering studies. FERC staff noted that the engineering studies developed by licensees and their consultants generally focus on the analysis of extreme events, such as earthquakes and floods. In reference to extreme events, FERC staff said that both actual past events and likely future events are considered in determining their magnitude. FERC staff noted the probable maximum flood—the flood that would be expected to result from the most extreme combination of reasonably possible meteorological and hydrological conditions—as an example of a dam design criterion that is based on application of analysis of extreme events. In describing the efficacy of probable maximum flood calculations, FERC officials stated that they had not observed a flood that exceeded the probable maximum flood calculated for any dam and noted that their Engineering Guidelines provides a conservative approach to estimating the probable maximum flood and other extreme events. FERC officials stated that requiring a conservative approach to estimating extreme events helps to mitigate the substantial uncertainty associated with these events, including in consideration of emerging data estimating the effects of climate change on extreme weather events. Once developed, engineering studies we reviewed often remained in effect for a number of years, until FERC or the licensee and its consultant determined an update was required. For example, we found that the hydrology studies were 20 years or older for 17 of the 42 dams in our review, including for 9 of the 16 high hazard dams in our sample. FERC’s Engineering Guidelines states that studies should be updated as appropriate. For example, FERC’s Engineering Guidelines on hydrology studies state that previously accepted flood studies are not required to be reevaluated unless it is determined that a re-analysis is warranted. The Guidelines notes that FERC or the consultant may consider reanalyzing the study for several reasons, including if they identify (1) significant errors in the original study; (2) new data that may significantly alter previous study results; or (3) significant changes in the conditions of the drainage basin. FERC staff and consultants we interviewed stated that age alone is not a primary criterion to update or replace studies and that studies should be updated as needed depending on several factors including age, new or additional data, and professional judgment. Consultants we interviewed identified some limitations that can affect their ability to develop engineering studies for a dam. For example, they noted that some dams may lack original design information, used prior to construction of the dam, which includes the assumptions and calculations used to determine the type and size of dam, the amount of water storage capacity, and information on the pre-construction site geology and earthquake potential. FERC officials estimated that for a large percentage of the dams they relicense, the original information is no longer available. For example, according to the report from the independent forensic team investigating the Oroville Dam incident and as previously noted, some design drawings and construction records for the dam’s spillway could not be located and some other documents that were available were not included in the most recent independent consultant inspection report submitted to FERC. To overcome the lack of original design information, FERC told us that licensees and their consultants may use teams of experts, advanced data collection techniques, and other modern methods, where feasible, to assess the dam’s ability to perform given current environmental conditions. In cases where design or other engineering information is incomplete, consultants stated that they generally recommend the licensee conduct additional studies based on the risk presented by the missing information but also noted that the financial resources of a licensee may affect its willingness and ability to conduct additional studies. However, FERC officials stated that FERC staff are ultimately responsible for making decisions on whether additional engineering studies are needed to evaluate a dam’s performance. FERC has established policies and procedures that use formal guidance, and permit the use of professional judgment, to evaluate and review engineering studies of dam performance submitted by licensees and their consultants. FERC officials in both the headquarters and regional offices emphasized that their role as the regulator is to review and validate engineering studies developed by the licensee and their consultants. FERC generally does not develop engineering studies as officials noted that dam safety, including the development of engineering studies, is primarily the licensee’s responsibility. To carry out their responsibility to ensure public safety, FERC staff stated they use procedures and criteria in the FERC Engineering Guidelines to review engineering studies and apply professional judgment to leverage their specialized knowledge, skills, and abilities to support their determinations of dam safety. FERC’s Engineering Guidelines provides a framework for the review of engineering studies, though the Guidelines recognizes that each dam is unique and allows for flexibility and exemptions in their use. Moreover, the Guidelines notes that analysis of data is useful when evaluating a dam’s performance, but should not be used as a substitute for judgment based on experience and common sense. Because FERC’s Engineering Guidelines allows for the application of professional judgment, the methods used to review these studies vary depending on the staff, the region, and individual dam characteristics. For example, FERC staff said that when they review consultants’ assumptions, methods, calculations and conclusions, in some cases they may decide to conduct a sensitivity analysis if—based on the staff’s judgment—they need to take additional steps to validate or confirm factors of safety for the project. FERC officials also stated that staff may conduct their own independent analyses, as appropriate, such as evaluating a major structural change to the dam or validating submitted studies. For example, as part of its 2016 review of the Union Valley Dam in California, FERC staff validated the submitted hydrology study by independently calculating key inputs, such as precipitation rates and peak floods, to evaluate the dam’s performance and verify the spillway’s reported capacity. In addition, FERC has established various controls to help ensure the quality of its review, including using a risk-based review process, assigning multiple staff to review the studies, and rotating staff responsibilities over time. We have previously found in our reporting on other regulatory agencies that practices such as rotating staff in key decision-making roles, and including at least two supervisory staff when conducting oversight reviews help reduce threats to independence and regulatory capture. Risk-based review process. FERC’s review approach is risk-based, as the frequency of staff’s review of these studies is based on the hazard classification of the dam as well as professional judgment. FERC relies on three primary engineering studies (hydrology, seismicity, and stability), and others as appropriate, which form the basis for determining if a dam is safe. In addition, FERC requires licensees to hire a FERC-approved independent consulting engineer at least every 5 years to inspect and evaluate high hazard and other applicable dams and submit a report detailing the findings as part of the independent consultant inspection process. In general, for the dams we reviewed, we found that FERC staff reviewed engineering studies for dams subject to independent consultant inspections (which are typically high or significant hazard dams) more frequently than those engineering studies associated with dams for which FERC does not require an independent consultant inspection (typically low hazard dams). For example, we found FERC staff had reviewed the most recent hydrology studies for all 22 high and significant hazard dams in our sample subject to independent consultant inspections within the last 6 years and documented their analysis. According to FERC officials, for dams not subject to an independent consultant inspection, FERC staff review engineering studies on an as needed basis, depending on whether the underlying assumptions and information from the previous studies are still relevant. For example, for the 20 dams in our study not subject to an independent consultant inspection, we found that most (15) of these studies were reviewed by FERC within the past 10 years, usually during the project’s relicensing. Multiple levels of supervisory review. As part of FERC’s quality control and internal oversight process, multiple FERC staff are to review the studies produced by the licensee and its consultant, with the number of successive reviews proportional to the complexity or importance of the study, according to FERC officials. FERC’s Operating Manual establishes the general procedure for the review of engineering studies. To begin the review process, the staff assigned to a dam is to review the engineering study and prepares an internal memo on its findings; that memo is then to be reviewed for accuracy and completeness by both a regional office Branch Chief, and the Regional Engineer. If necessary, Washington, D.C., headquarters office staff are to review and approve the final memo. Upon completion of review, FERC staff are to provide a letter to the licensee indicating any particular areas where additional information is needed or where more studies are needed to evaluate the dam’s performance. According to FERC officials, each level of review adds successive quality control steps performed by experienced staff. We have previously found in reporting on other regulatory agencies that additional levels of review increases transparency and accountability and diminishes the risk of regulatory capture. Rotation of FERC staff responsibilities. As part of an internal quality control program to help minimize the risk of missing important safety- related items, FERC officials told us they rotate staff assignments and responsibilities approximately every 3 to 4 years. According to FERC officials, this practice decreases the chance that a deficiency would be missed over time due to differences in areas of engineering expertise between or among staff. We have previously found in our reporting on other regulatory agencies that strategies such as more frequently rotating staff in key roles can help reduce the risk to supervisory independence and regulatory capture. Some FERC regional offices have developed practices to further enhance their review of these studies. For example, the New York Regional Office established a subject matter expert team that helps review dams with unusually complex hydrology issues. This team was created, in part, because FERC staff noted that some of the hydrology studies conducted in the 1990s and 2000s were not as thorough as they would have wanted, and warranted a re-examination. Currently, the New York Regional Office is reviewing the hydrology analysis associated with 12 dam break studies to determine if the hydrology data used in developing these studies were as rigorously developed and validated. According to the FERC staff in this office, utilizing a team of subject matter experts has reduced Regional Office review time and improved the hydrology studies’ accuracy. FERC staff in the New York Regional Office also told us that they are working with other regional offices on setting up similar technical teams. For example, FERC staff in the New York Regional Office have been working with the Portland Regional Office to set up a similar team. FERC procedures require the use of engineering studies at key points over the dam’s licensing period to inform components of its safety oversight approach, including during the potential failure mode analyses of individual dams as well as during relicensing. Potential failure mode analysis. The potential failure mode analysis is to occur during the recurring independent consultant inspection and is conducted by the licensee’s independent consultant along with other key dam safety stakeholders. As previously explained, the analysis incorporates the engineering studies and identifies events that could cause a dam to potentially fail. During the potential failure mode analysis, FERC, the licensee, the consultant, and other key dam safety stakeholders are to refer to the engineering studies to establish environmental conditions that inform dam failure scenarios, the risks associated with these failures, and their consequences for an individual dam. Further, according to a FERC white paper on risk analysis, FERC is beginning to use information related to potential failure modes as inputs to an analysis tool that quantifies risks at each dam. With this information, FERC expects to make relative risk estimates of dams within its inventory and establish priorities for further study or remediation of risks at individual dams, according to the white paper. Relicensing. During relicensing, FERC staff are to review the engineering studies as well as information such as historical hydrological data and extreme weather events, which also inform their safety evaluation of the licensee’s application. FERC officials also stated that as a result of their relicensing review, they might alter the articles of the new license before it is issued should their reviews indicate that environmental conditions affecting the dam’s safety have changed. We found that FERC generally met its requirement to evaluate dam safety during the relicensing process for the 42 dams we reviewed. During the relicensing process, we found that for the dams we reviewed, FERC staff review safety information such as the past reports, inspections, and studies conducted by FERC, the licensee, and independent consultants and determine whether or not a dam owner operated and maintained its dam safely. According to FERC staff, the safety review for relicensing is generally a summary of prior safety and inspection information, rather than an analysis of new safety information, unless the licensee proposes a change to the operation or structure. FERC’s review during relicensing for the high hazard and significant hazard dams we reviewed was generally consistent with its guidance and safety memo template, though the extent of its review of low hazard dams varied. (See fig. 3.) For example, for the 22 high and significant hazard dams we reviewed, the safety relicensing memos followed the template and nearly all included summaries of hydrology studies, stability analyses, prior FERC inspections, and applicable independent consultant reports. For the 20 low hazard dams, FERC staff noted that some requirements in the template are not applicable or have been exempted and therefore were not reviewed during relicensing. While low hazard dams were more inconsistently reviewed during relicensing, FERC staff also noted that there has been a recent emphasis to more closely review, replace, or conduct engineering studies, such as the stability study, for low hazard dams during relicensing. Moreover, FERC staff told us that the safety risks associated with these dams are minimal, as the failure of a low hazard dam, by definition, does not pose a threat to human life or economic activity. According to FERC staff, if a licensee proposed altering the dam or its operations in any way as part of its application for a new license, FERC staff would review the proposed change and may recommend adding articles to the new license prior to its issuance to ensure dam safety. FERC officials noted that, as part of their review, any structural or operational changes proposed by the licensee during relicensing are reviewed by FERC. These officials also noted that FERC generally recommends modifications to the licensees’ proposed changes prior to their approval and inclusion in the new license. However, FERC officials noted that, in some cases, additional information is needed prior to approving the structural or operational change to ensure there are no risks posed by the changes. In those instances, FERC may recommend that articles be added to the new license, that require the licensee to conduct additional engineering studies of the issue and submit them to FERC for review and approval. For example, during the relicensing of the Otter Creek project in Vermont in 2014, the licensee proposed changes to the project’s operation resulting from construction. As a result, FERC’s staff recommended adding a number of articles to the license, including that the licensee conduct studies to evaluate the effect of the change on safety and to ensure safety during construction. During relicensing, third parties—such as environmental organizations, nearby residents and communities, and other federal agencies, such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service—may provide input on various topics related to the project, including safety. However, FERC officials said that very few third parties file studies or comments related to dam safety during relicensing. FERC’s template and guidance do not specifically require the consideration of such analyses as part of its safety review, and we did not identify any safety studies submitted by third parties for dams or reviewed by FERC in our sample. According to FERC officials, when stakeholders submit comments during relicensing, the comments tend to focus on environmental aspects of the project, such as adding passages for fish migration. Further, FERC is not required under the Federal Power Act to respond to any comments, including those related to dam safety, from third parties, according to FERC officials. However, according to FERC officials, courts have held that the Administrative Procedure Act precludes an agency from arbitrarily and capriciously ignoring issues raised in comments. Furthermore, these officials stated that if a court determines that FERC did not sufficiently address issues raised during the relicensing process, its orders are subject to being reversed and remanded by applicable United States courts of appeals. Moreover, FERC officials noted that the information needed to develop third party safety studies, such as the dam design drawings and engineering studies, are property of the licensee, rather than FERC. In addition, this information may not be readily available to third parties or the public if FERC designates it as critical energy infrastructure information, which would preclude its release to the general public. FERC staff we interviewed stated that there have been no instances where the Commission denied a new license to a licensee as a result of its safety review during relicensing. FERC staff stated that given the frequency of other inspections, including the FERC staff inspections, and independent consultant inspections, it is unlikely staff would find a previously unknown major safety issue during relicensing. FERC staff told us that rather than deny a license for safety deficiencies, FERC will keep a dam owner under the terms of a FERC license to better ensure the licensee remedies existing safety deficiencies. Specifically, FERC staff noted that under a license, FERC can ensure dam safety by (1) closely monitoring the deficiency’s remediation progress through its inspection program, (2) adding license terms in the new license tailored to the specific safety deficiency, and (3), as necessary, pursuing compliance and enforcement actions, such as civil penalties or stop work orders, to enforce the terms and conditions of the license. For example, prior to and during the relicensing of a FERC-licensed project in Wisconsin in 2014, FERC’s review identified that the spillway capacity was inadequate. While the project was relicensed in 2017 without changes to the spillway, FERC officials stated that they have been overseeing the plans and studies of the remediation of the spillway through their ongoing inspection program. However, if an imminent safety threat is identified during the relicensing review, FERC officials stated that they will order that the licensee take actions to remedy the issue immediately. Moreover, FERC officials noted that, if necessary, a license can be revoked for failure to comply with the terms of its license. FERC designed a multi-layered safety approach—which uses inspections, studies, and other assessments of individual dams—to reduce exposure to safety risks. However, as the spillway failure at the Oroville Dam project in 2017 demonstrated, it is not possible to eliminate all uncertainties and risks. As part of a continuing effort to ensure dam safety at licensed projects, FERC could complement its approach to evaluating the safety of individual dams by enhancing its capability to assess and identify the risks across its portfolio of licensed dams. Specifically, while FERC has collected and stored a substantial amount of information from its individual dam safety inspections, FERC’s approach to recording this information is inconsistent due to a lack of standard language and procedures. By clarifying its approach to the recording of information collected during inspections, FERC officials could help ensure that the information recorded is comparable when shared across its regions. Moreover, the absence of standard language and procedures to consistently record inspection information impedes a broader, portfolio- wide analysis of the extent of and characteristics associated with common safety deficiencies identified during FERC inspections. While FERC has not yet conducted such an analysis, a proactive assessment of common safety inspection deficiencies across FERC’s portfolio of licensed dams— similar to its identification of dam spillways with safety concerns following the Oroville Dam incident—could help FERC and its licensees identify safety risks prior to a safety incident and to develop approaches to mitigate those risks. We are making the following two recommendations to FERC: FERC should provide standard language and procedures to its staff on how to record information collected during inspections, including how and where to record information about safety deficiencies, in order to facilitate analysis of safety deficiencies across FERC’s portfolio of regulated dams. (Recommendation 1) FERC should use information from its inspections to assess safety risks across its portfolio of regulated dams to identify and prioritize safety risks at a national level. (Recommendation 2) We provided a draft of this report to FERC for review and comment. In its comments on the draft report, FERC said it generally agreed with the draft report’s findings and found the recommendations to be constructive. FERC said that it would direct staff to develop appropriate next steps to implement GAO’s recommendations. These comments are reproduced in appendix IV. In addition, FERC provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to the Chairman of FERC and other interested parties. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at 202-512-2834 or vonaha@gao.gov. Contact points for our Office of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made major contributions to this report are listed in appendix V. FERC seeks to ensure licensees’ compliance with FERC regulations and license requirements, including remediating safety deficiencies, by using a mix of preventative strategies to help identify situations before they become problems and reactive strategies such as issuing penalties. As part of its efforts, FERC published a compliance handbook in 2015 that provides an overall guide to compliance and enforcement of a variety of license requirements, including dam safety. The handbook includes instructions for implementing FERC rules, regulations, policies, and programs designed to ensure effective compliance with license conditions, which include dam safety, to protect and enhance beneficial public uses of waterways. FERC developed a range of enforcement actions, that include holding workshops to encourage compliance and issuing guidance, that increase in severity depending on the non- compliance issue. (See fig. 4.) More broadly, FERC’s guidance directs officials to determine enforcement actions and time frames for those actions on a case-by-case basis, depending on the characteristics of the specific compliance issue. According to FERC officials, many of these safety compliance discussions are handled informally. In addition, their compliance approach emphasizes activities that assist, rather than force, licensees to achieve compliance, according to its guidance. These activities include facilitating open lines of communication with licensees, participating in technical workshops, and publishing brochures and guidance documents, among other efforts. Also, according to these officials, FERC works with licensees to provide guidance and warnings of possible non-compliance matters, in order to avoid usage of any enforcement tools, if possible. According to FERC officials, any safety issues that endanger the public will result in immediate penalty or removal of the dam from power generation, but this action is not lightly taken. Additionally, the length of time between when a safety deficiency is identified and is resolved varies substantially depending on the specific project. As stated earlier in this report, FERC works with licensees to determine a plan and schedule for investigating safety issues and making any needed modifications. However, FERC officials stated that the majority of safety compliance issues are resolved within a month. However, FERC officials stated that if a licensee repeatedly does not take steps to address a compliance issue, FERC will explore enforcement actions through a formal process. According to officials, FERC’s enforcement options are based on authorities provided under the Federal Power Act and such options are flexible because of the variation in hazards, consequences, and dams. According to FERC officials, to ensure compliance with safety regulations, if a settlement cannot be reached, FERC may, among other things, issue an order to show cause, issue civil penalties in the form of fines to licensees, impose stop work or cease power generation orders, revoke licenses, and seek injunctions in federal court. Nevertheless, FERC officials stated that there is no specific requirement for how quickly the compliance issues or deficiencies should be resolved and that some issues can take years to resolve. For example, in 2004, the current licensee of a hydroelectric project operating in Edenville, Michigan, acquired the project, which was found by FERC to be in a state of non-compliance at that time. FERC staff made numerous attempts to work with the licensee to resolve the compliance issues. However, they were unable to resolve these issues and as a result issued a cease generation order in 2017, followed in 2018 by a license revocation order. In practice, FERC’s use of these enforcement tools to resolve safety issues has been fairly limited, particularly in comparison to other license compliance issues, according to FERC officials. Since 2013, FERC has issued one civil penalty for a safety-related hydropower violation and has issued compliance orders on eight other projects for safety-related reasons, including orders to cease generation on three projects. For the 14 projects and 42 dams we reviewed, FERC licensees and their consultants used a variety of tools to develop engineering studies of dam performance (see table 3). These tools included programs and modeling tools developed by government agencies, such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps), as well as commercially available modeling tools. FERC officials stated that they also used a number of the same tools used by its licensees and consultants. Similarly, for the 14 projects and 42 dams we reviewed, FERC licensees and their consultants used a variety of datasets to develop engineering studies of dam performance (see table 4). These datasets included data maintained and updated by various government agencies, including the United States Geological Survey and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. FERC officials stated that they also used a number of the same datasets used by its licensees and consultants. This report assesses: (1) how FERC collects information from its dam safety inspections and the extent to which FERC analyzes it; (2) how FERC evaluates engineering studies of dam performance to analyze safety, and (3) the extent to which FERC reviews dam safety information during relicensing and the information FERC considers. This report also includes information on FERC actions to ensure licensee compliance with license requirements related to dam safety (app. I) and selected models and data sets used to develop and evaluate engineering studies of dam performance (app. II). For each of the objectives, we reviewed laws, regulations, FERC guidance, templates, and other documentation pertaining to FERC’s evaluation of dam safety. In addition, we reviewed an independent forensic team’s assessment of the causes of the Oroville Dam incident, including the report’s analysis of FERC’s approach to ensuring safety at the project, to understand any limitations of FERC’s approach identified by the report. We also reviewed dam safety documentation, including dam performance studies, FERC memorandums, the most recent completed inspection report, and other information, from a non-probability sample of 14 projects encompassing 42 dams relicensed from fiscal years 2014 through 2017. (See table 5.) We selected these projects and dams to include ones that were geographically dispersed, had varying potential risks associated with their potential failure, and had differences in the length of their relicensing process. We developed a data collection instrument to collect information from the dam safety documentation and analyzed data from the sample to evaluate the extent to which FERC followed its dam safety guidance across the selected projects. To develop the data collection instrument, we reviewed and incorporated FERC oversight requirements from its regulations, guidance, and templates. We conducted three pre-tests of the instrument, and revised the instrument after each pre-test. To ensure consistency and accuracy in the collection of this information, for each dam in the sample, one analyst conducted an initial review of the dam safety documentation; a second analyst reviewed the information independently; and the two analysts reconciled any differences. Following our review of the information from the dam safety documentation, we conducted semi-structured interviews with FERC engineering staff associated with each of the 14 projects and 42 dams to obtain information about FERC’s inspections, review of dam performance studies, and analysis of safety during the relicensing of these projects. Our interviews with these FERC staff provided insight into FERC’s dam safety oversight approach and are not generalizable to all projects. We also interviewed FERC officials responsible for dam safety about dam safety practices. In addition, to review how FERC collects information from its dam safety inspections and the extent to which FERC analyzes it, we also reviewed inspection data from FERC’s information management systems from fiscal years 2014 through 2017. To assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed guidance and interviewed FERC officials. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We compared FERC’s approach to collecting, recording and using safety information to federal internal control standards for the design of information systems and related control activities. We also reviewed our prior work on portfolio- level risk management. To evaluate how FERC evaluates engineering studies of dam performance to analyze dam safety, we reviewed FERC policies and guidance. We interviewed six independent consultants having experience inspecting and analyzing FERC-regulated dams to understand how engineering studies of dam performance are developed. We selected consultants who had submitted an inspection report to FERC recently (between December 2017 and February 2018) based on the geographic location of the project they reviewed and experience conducting these inspections, and the number of reports submitted to FERC over this time period. (See table 6.) Our interviews with these consultants provided insight into FERC’s approach to conducting and reviewing studies and are not generalizable to all projects or consultants. To evaluate the extent to which FERC reviews dam safety information during relicensing and the information it considers, we reviewed templates developed by FERC to assess safety during the relicensing and analyzed the extent to which staff followed guidance in these templates for the 14 projects and 42 dams in our sample. We also interviewed stakeholders, including the National Hydropower Association and Friends of the River to obtain general perspectives on FERC’s relicensing approach. Our interviews with these stakeholders provided insight into FERC’s approach to relicensing, and these views are not generalizable across all stakeholders. To review actions to ensure licensee compliance with license requirements related to dam safety, we reviewed FERC’s guidance related to compliance and enforcement and interviewed FERC officials responsible for implementation of the guidance. To review information on models and datasets used to develop and evaluate engineering studies of dam performance, we reviewed dam safety documentation associated with the projects in our sample (described previously), reviewed FERC documentation, and interviewed FERC officials. We conducted this performance audit from July 2017 to October 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Andrew Von Ah, (202) 512-2834 or vonaha@gao.gov.

FERC is the federal regulator of the Oroville Dam and over 2,500 other dams associated with nonfederal hydropower projects nationwide. FERC issues and renews licenses—which can last up to 50 years—to dam operators and promotes safe dam operation by conducting safety inspections and reviewing technical engineering studies, among other actions. GAO was asked to review FERC's approach to overseeing dam safety. This report examines: (1) how FERC collects information from its dam safety inspections and the extent of its analysis, and (2) how FERC evaluates engineering studies of dam performance to analyze safety, among other objectives. GAO analyzed documentation on a non-generalizable sample of 42 dams associated with projects relicensed from fiscal years 2014 through 2017, selected based on geography and hazard classifications, among other factors. GAO also reviewed FERC regulations and documents; and interviewed FERC staff associated with the selected projects and technical consultants, selected based on the frequency and timing of their reviews. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) staff generally followed established guidance in collecting safety information from dam inspections for the dams GAO reviewed, but FERC has not used this information to analyze dam safety portfolio-wide. For these 42 dams, GAO found that FERC staff generally followed guidance in collecting safety information during inspections of individual dams and key structures associated with those dams. (See figure.) However, FERC lacks standard procedures that specify how and where staff should record safety deficiencies identified. As a result, FERC staff use multiple systems to record inspection findings, thereby creating information that cannot be easily analyzed. Further, while FERC officials said inspections help oversee individual dam's safety, FERC has not analyzed this information to identify any safety risks across its portfolio. GAO's prior work has highlighted the importance of evaluating risks across a portfolio. FERC officials stated that they have not conducted portfolio-wide analyses because officials prioritize the individual dam inspections and response to urgent dam safety incidents. However, following the Oroville incident, a FERC-led initiative to examine dam structures comparable to those at Oroville identified 27 dam spillways with varying degrees of safety concerns, on which FERC officials stated they are working with dam licensees to address. A similar and proactive portfolio-wide approach, based on analysis of common inspection deficiencies across the portfolio of dams under FERC's authority, could help FERC identify safety risks prior to a safety incident. Guidelines recognize that each dam is unique and allow for flexibility and exemptions in its use. FERC staff use the studies to inform other components of their safety approach, including the analysis of dam failure scenarios and their review of safety to determine whether to renew a license. GAO recommends that FERC: (1) develop standard procedures for recording information collected as part of its inspections, and (2) use inspection information to assess safety risks across FERC's portfolio of dams. FERC agreed with GAO's recommendations.""]","8621","gov_report","en","None","0371cc1b07fbeda7a45b02063ca36c1d740834ac14eb2b5f","Summary:","gov_report","532","\n\nThe report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) examines the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) approach to ensure dam safety at hydropower projects.

Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nThe federal child nutrition programs provide assistance to schools and other institutions in the form of cash, commodity food, and administrative support (such as technical assistance and administrative funding) based on the provision of meals and snacks to children. In general, these programs were created (and amended over time) to both improve children's nutrition and provide support to the agriculture economy. Today, the child nutrition programs refer primarily to the following meal, snack, and milk reimbursement programs (these and other acronyms are listed in Appendix A ): National School Lunch Program (NSLP) (Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.)); School Breakfast Program (SBP) (Child Nutrition Act, Section 4 (42 U.S.C. 1773)); Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) (Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, Section 17 (42 U.S.C. 1766)); Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) (Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, Section 13 (42 U.S.C. 1761)); and Special Milk Program (SMP) (Child Nutrition Act, Section 3 (42 U.S.C. 1772)). The programs provide financial support and/or foods to the institutions that prepare meals and snacks served outside of the home (unlike other food assistance programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly the Food Stamp Program) where benefits are used to purchase food for home consumption). Though exact eligibility rules and pricing vary by program, in general the amount of federal reimbursement is greater for meals served to qualifying low-income individuals or at qualifying institutions, although most programs provide some subsidy for all food served. Participating children receive subsidized meals and snacks, which may be free or at reduced price. Forthcoming sections discuss how program-specific eligibility rules and funding operate. This report describes how each program operates under current law, focusing on eligibility rules, participation, and funding. This introductory section describes some of the background and principles that generally apply to all of the programs; subsequent sections go into further detail on the workings of each. Unless stated otherwise, participation and funding data come from USDA-FNS's ""Keydata Reports."" The child nutrition programs are most often dated back to the 1946 enactment of the National School Lunch Act, which created the National School Lunch Program, albeit in a different form than it operates today. Most of the child nutrition programs do not date back to 1946; they were added and amended in the decades to follow as policymakers expanded child nutrition programs' institutional settings and meals provided: The Special Milk Program was created in 1954, regularly extended, and made permanent in 1970. The School Breakfast Program was piloted in 1966, regularly extended, and eventually made permanent in 1975. A program for child care settings and summer programs was piloted in 1968, with separate programs authorized in 1975 and then made permanent in 1978. These are now the Child and Adult Care Food Program and Summer Food Service Program. The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program began as a pilot in 2002, was made permanent in 2004, and was expanded nationwide in 2008. The programs are now authorized under three major federal statutes: the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (originally enacted as the National School Lunch Act in 1946), the Child Nutrition Act (originally enacted in 1966), and Section 32 of the act of August 24, 1935 (7 U.S.C. 612c). Congressional jurisdiction over the underlying three laws has typically been exercised by the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee; the House Education and the Workforce Committee; and, to a limited extent (relating to commodity food assistance and Section 32 issues), the House Agriculture Committee. Congress periodically reviews and reauthorizes expiring authorities under these laws. The child nutrition programs were most recently reauthorized in 2010 through the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA, P.L. 111-296 ); some of the authorities created or extended in that law expired on September 30, 2015. WIC (the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children) is also typically reauthorized with the child nutrition programs. WIC is not one of the child nutrition programs and is not discussed in this report. The 114 th Congress began but did not complete a 2016 child nutrition reauthorization (see CRS Report R44373, Tracking the Next Child Nutrition Reauthorization: An Overview ). There was no significant legislative activity with regard to reauthorization in the 115 th Congress. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service (USDA-FNS) administers the programs at the federal level. The programs are operated by a wide variety of local public and private providers and the degree of direct state involvement differs by program and state. At the state level, education, health, social services, and agriculture departments all have roles; at a minimum, they are responsible for approving and overseeing local providers such as schools, summer program sponsors, and child care centers and day care homes, as well as making sure they receive the federal support they are due. At the local level, program benefits are provided to millions of children (e.g., there were 30.0 million in the National School Lunch Program, the largest of the programs, in FY2017), through some 100,000 public and private schools and residential child care institutions, nearly 170,000 child care centers and family day care homes, and just over 50,000 summer program sites. All programs are available in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Virtually all operate in Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands (and, in differing versions, in the Northern Marianas and American Samoa). This section summarizes the nature and extent to which the programs' funding is mandatory and discretionary, including a discussion of appropriated entitlement status. Table 3 lists child nutrition program and related expenditures. Most spending for child nutrition programs is provided in annual appropriations acts to fulfill the legal financial obligation established by the authorizing laws. That is, the level of spending for such programs, referred to as appropriated mandatory spending, is not controlled through the annual appropriations process, but instead is derived from the benefit and eligibility criteria specified in the authorizing laws. The appropriated mandatory funding is treated as mandatory spending. Further, if Congress does not appropriate the funds necessary to fund the program, eligible entities may have legal recourse. Congress typically considers the Administration's forecast for program needs in its appropriations decisions. For the majority of funding discussed in this report, the formula that controls the funding is not capped and fluctuates based on the reimbursement rates and the number of meals/snacks served in the programs. In the meal service programs, such as the National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, summer programs, and assistance for child care centers and day care homes, federal aid is provided in the form of statutorily set subsidies (reimbursements) paid for each meal/snack served that meets federal nutrition guidelines. Although all (including full-price) meals/snacks served by participating providers are subsidized, those served free or at a reduced price to lower-income children are supported at higher rates. All federal meal/snack subsidy rates are indexed annually (each July) for inflation, as are the income eligibility thresholds for free and reduced-price meals/snacks. Subsequent sections discuss how a specific program's eligibility and reimbursements work. Most subsidies are cash payments to schools or other providers, but a smaller portion of aid is provided in the form of USDA-purchased commodity foods . Laws for three child nutrition programs (NSLP, CACFP, and SFSP) require the provision of commodity foods (or in some cases allow cash in lieu of commodity foods). Meal and snack service entails nonfood costs. Federal child nutrition per-meal/snack subsidies may be used to cover local providers' administrative and operating costs. However, the separate direct federal payments for administrative/operating costs (""State Administrative Expenses,"" discussed in the "" Related Programs, Initiatives, and Support Activities "" section) are limited. In addition to the open-ended, appropriated entitlement funds summarized above, the child nutrition programs' funding also includes certain other mandatory funding and a limited amount of discretionary funding. Some of the activities discussed in "" Related Programs, Initiatives, and Support Activities ,"" such as Team Nutrition, are provided for with discretionary funding. Aside from the annually appropriated funding, the child nutrition programs are also supported by certain permanent appropriations and transfers. Notably, funding for the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program is funded by a transfer from USDA's Section 32 program, a permanent appropriation of 30% of the previous year's customs receipts. Federal subsidies do not necessarily cover the full cost of the meals and snacks offered by providers. States and localities help cover program costs, as do children's families by paying charges for nonfree or reduced-price meals/snacks. There is a nonfederal cost-sharing requirement for the school meals programs (discussed below), and some states supplement school funding through additional state per-meal reimbursements or other prescribed financing arrangements. Subsequent sections of this report delve into the details of how each of the child nutrition programs support the service of meals and snacks in institutional settings; first, it is useful to take a broader perspective of primary program elements. Table 1 is a top-level look at the different programs that displays distinguishing characteristics (what meals are provided, in what settings, to what ages) and recent program spending.

Principles and concepts common to both programs are discussed first; subsections then discuss features and data unique to the NSLP and SBP, respectively. The federal school meals programs provide federal support in the form of cash assistance and USDA commodity foods; both are provided according to statutory formulas based on the number of reimbursable meals served in schools. The subsidized meals are served by both public and private nonprofit elementary and secondary schools and residential child care institutions (RCCIs) that opt to enroll and guarantee to offer free or reduced-price meals to eligible low-income children. Both cash and commodity support to participating schools are calculated based on the number and price of meals served (e.g., lunch or breakfast, free or full price), but once the aid is received by the school it is used to support the overall school meal service budget, as determined by the school. This report focuses on the federal reimbursements and funding, but it should be noted that some states have provided state financing through additional state-specific funding. Federal law does not require schools to participate in the school meals programs. However, some states have mandated that schools provide lunch and/or breakfast, and some of these states require that their schools do so through NSLP and/or SBP. The program is open to public and private schools. A reimbursable meal requires compliance with federal school nutrition standards, which have changed throughout the history of the program based on nutritional science and children's nutritional needs. Food items not served as a complete meal meeting nutrition standards (e.g., a la carte offerings) are not reimbursable meals, and therefore are not eligible for federal per-meal, per-snack reimbursements. Following rulemaking to implement provisions in the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-296 ), USDA updated the nutrition standards for reimbursable meals in January 2012 (see "" Nutrition Standards "" for more information). Schools serving meals that meet the updated nutrition standards are eligible for an increased reimbursement of 6 cents per lunch. USDA-FNS administers the school meals programs federally, and state agencies (typically state departments of education) oversee and transmit reimbursements through agreements with school food authorities (SFAs) (typically local educational agencies (LEAs); usually these are school districts). Figure 1 provides an overview of the roles and relationships between these levels of government. There is a cost-sharing requirement for the programs, which amounts to a contribution of approximately $200 million from the states. There also are states that choose to supplement federal reimbursements with their own state reimbursements. The school meals programs and related funding do not serve only low-income children. All students can receive a meal at a NSLP- or SBP-participating school, but how much the child pays for the meal and/or how much of a federal reimbursement the state receives will depend largely on whether the child qualifies for a ""free,"" ""reduced-price,"" or ""paid"" (i.e., advertised price) meal. Both NSLP and SBP use the same household income eligibility criteria and categorical eligibility rules. States and schools receive the largest reimbursements for free meals, smaller reimbursements for reduced-price meals, and the smallest (but still some federal financial support) for the full-price meals. There are three pathways through which a child can become certified to receive a free or reduced-price meal: 1. Household income eligibility for free and reduced-price meals (information typically collected via household application), 2. Categorical (or automatic) eligibility for free meals (information collected via household application or a direct certification process), and 3. School-wide free meals under the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) , an option for eligible schools that is based on the share of students identified as eligible for free meals. Each of these pathways is discussed in more detail below. The income eligibility thresholds (shown in Table 2 ) are based on multipliers of the federal poverty guidelines. As the poverty guidelines are updated every year, so are the eligibility thresholds for NSLP and SBP. Free Meals: Children receive free meals if they have household income at or below 130% of the federal poverty guidelines; these meals receive the highest subsidy rate. (Reimbursements are approximately $3.30 per lunch served, less for breakfast.) Reduced-Price Meals: Children may receive reduced-price meals (charges of no more than 40 cents for a lunch or 30 cents for a breakfast) if their household income is above 130% and less than or equal to 185% of the federal poverty guidelines; these meals receive a subsidy rate that is 40 cents (NSLP) or 30 cents (SBP) below the free meal rate. (Reimbursements are approximately $2.90 per lunch served.) Paid Meals: A comparatively small per-meal reimbursement is provided for full-price or paid meals served to children whose families do not apply for assistance or whose family income does not qualify them for free or reduced-price meals. The paid meal price is set by the school but must comply with federal regulations. (Reimbursements are approximately 30 cents per lunch served.) The above reimbursement rates are approximate; exact current-year federal reimbursement rates for NSLP and SBP are listed in Table B -1 and Table B -3 , respectively. Households complete paper or online applications that collect relevant income and household size data, so that the school district can determine if children in the household are eligible for free meals, reduced-price meals, or neither. Though these income guidelines primarily influence funding and administration of NSLP and SBP, they also affect the eligibility rules for the SFSP, CACFP, and SMP (described further in subsequent sections). In addition to the eligibility thresholds listed above, the school meals programs also convey eligibility for free meals based on household participation in certain other need-tested programs or children's specified vulnerabilities (e.g., foster children). Per Section 12 of the National School Lunch Act, ""a child shall be considered automatically eligible for a free lunch and breakfast ... without further application or eligibility determination, if the child is"" in a household receiving benefits through SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program); FDPIR (Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, a program that operates in lieu of SNAP on some Indian reservations) benefits; or TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) cash assistance; enrolled in Head Start; in foster care; a migrant; a runaway; or homeless. For meals served to students certified in the above categories, the state/school receive a reimbursement at the free meal amount and children receive a free meal. (See Table B -1 and Table B -3 for school year 2018-2019 rates.) Some school districts collect information for these categorical eligibility rules via paper application. Others conduct a process called direct certification —a proactive process where government agencies typically cross-check their program rolls and certify a household's children for free school meals without the household having to complete a school meals application. Prior to 2004, states had the option to conduct direct certification of SNAP (then, the Food Stamp Program), TANF, and FDPIR participants. In the 2004 child nutrition reauthorization ( P.L. 108-265 ), states were required under federal law to conduct direct certification for SNAP participants, with nationwide implementation taking effect in school year 2008-2009. Conducting direct certification for TANF and FDPIR remains at the state's discretion. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA; P.L. 111-296 ) made further policy changes to expand direct certification (discussed further in the next section). One of those changes was the initiation of a demonstration project to look at expanding categorical eligibility and direct certification to some Medicaid households. The law also funded performance incentive grants for high-performing states and authorized correcting action planning for low-performing states in direct certification activities. Under SNAP direct certification rules generally, schools enter into agreements with SNAP agencies to certify children in SNAP households as eligible for free school meals without requiring a separate application from the family. Direct certification systems match student enrollment lists against SNAP agency records, eliminating the need for action by the child's parents or guardians. Direct certification allows schools to make use of SNAP's more in-depth eligibility certification process; this can reduce errors that may occur in school lunch application eligibility procedures that are otherwise used. From a program access perspective, direct certification also reduces the number of applications a household must complete. Figure 2 , created by GAO and published in a May 2014 report, provides an overview of how school districts certify students for free and reduced-price meals under the income-based and category-based rules, via applications and direct certification. A USDA-FNS study of school year 2014-2015 estimates that 11.1 million students receiving free meals were directly certified—68% of all categorically eligible students receiving free meals. HHFKA also authorized the school meals Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), an option in NSLP and SBP law that allows eligible schools and school districts to offer free meals to all enrolled students based on the percentage of their students who are identified as automatically eligible from nonhousehold application sources (primarily direct certification through other programs). Based on the statutory parameters, USDA-FNS piloted CEP in various states over three school years and it expanded nationwide in school year 2014-2015. Eligible LEAs have until June 30 of each year to notify USDA-FNS if they will participate in CEP. According to a database maintained by the Food Research and Action Center, just over 20,700 schools in more than 3,500 school districts (LEAs) participated in CEP in SY2016-2017, an increase of approximately 2,500 schools compared to SY2015-2016. For a school (or school district, or group of schools within a district) to provide free meals to all children the school(s) must be eligible for CEP based on the share (40% or greater) of enrolled children that can be identified as categorically (or automatically) eligible for free meals, and the school must opt-in to CEP. Though CEP schools serve free meals to all students, they are not reimbursed at the ""free meal"" rate for every meal. Instead, the law provides a funding formula: the percentage of students identified as automatically eligible (the ""identified student percentage"" or ISP) is multiplied by a factor of 1.6 to estimate the proportion of students who would be eligible for free or reduced-price meals had they been certified via application. The result is the percentage of meals served that will be reimbursed at the free meal rate, with the remainder reimbursed at the far lower paid meal rate. For example, if a CEP school identifies that 40% of students are eligible for free meals, then 64% of the meals served will be reimbursed at the free meal rate and 36% at the paid meal rate. Schools that identify 62.5% or more students as eligible for free meals receive the free meal reimbursement for all meals served. Some of the considerations that may impact a school's decision to participate in CEP include whether the new funding formula would be beneficial for their school meal budget; an interest in reducing paperwork for families and schools; and an interest in providing more free meals, including meals to students who have not participated in the program before. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA; P.L. 111-296 ) set in motion changes to the nutrition standards for school meals, requiring USDA to update the standards within a certain timeframe. The law required that the revised standards be based on recommendations from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) (now the Health and Medicine Division) at the National Academy of Sciences. The law also provided increased federal subsidies (6 cents per lunch) for schools meeting the new requirements and funding for technical assistance related to implementation. USDA published the final regulations in January 2012. The final rule sought to align school meal patterns with the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and, generally consistent with IOM's recommendations, increased the amount of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat or fat-free milk in school meals. The regulations also included calorie maximums and sodium limits to phase in over time, among other requirements. The nutrition standards largely took effect in SY2012-2013 for lunches and in SY2013-2014 for breakfasts. A few other requirements were scheduled to phase in over multiple school years. Some schools experienced difficulty implementing the new guidelines, and Congress and USDA have made changes to the 2012 final rule's whole grain, sodium, and milk requirements. For SY2019-2020 and onwards, schools are operating under a final rule published December 12, 2018. The HHFKA also gave USDA the authority to regulate other foods in the school nutrition environment. Sometimes called ""competitive foods,"" these include foods and drinks sold in a la carte lines, vending machines, snack bars and concession stands, and fundraisers. Relying on recommendations made by a 2007 IOM report, USDA-FNS promulgated a proposed rule and then an interim final rule in June 2013, which went into effect for SY2014-2015. The interim final rule created nutrition guidelines for all non-meal foods and beverages that are sold during the school day (defined as midnight until 30 minutes after dismissal). The final rule, published on July 29, 2016, maintained the interim final rules with minor modifications. Under the final standards, these foods must meet whole-grain requirements; have certain primary ingredients; and meet calorie, sodium, and fat limits, among other requirements. Schools are limited to a list of no- and low-calorie beverages they may sell (with larger portion sizes and caffeine allowed in high schools). There are no limits on fundraisers selling foods that meet the interim final rule's guidelines. Fundraisers outside of the school day are not subject to the guidelines. HHFKA and the interim final rule provide states with discretion to exempt infrequent fundraisers selling foods or beverages that do not meet the nutrition standards. The rule does not limit foods brought from home, only foods sold at school during the school day. The federal standards are minimum standards; states and school districts are permitted to issue more stringent policies. In FY2017, NSLP subsidized 4.9 billion lunches to children in close to 96,000 schools and 3,200 residential child care institutions (RCCIs). Average daily participation was 30.0 million students (58% of children enrolled in participating schools and RCCIs). Of the participating students, 66.7% (20.0 million) received free lunches and 6.5% (2.0 million) received reduced-price lunches. The remainder were served full-price meals, though schools still receive a reimbursement for these meals. Figure 3 shows FY2017 participation data. FY2017 federal school lunch costs totaled approximately $13.6 billion (see Table 3 for the various components of this total). The vast majority of this funding is for per-meal reimbursements for free and reduced-price lunches. The HHFKA also provided an additional 6-cent per-lunch reimbursement to schools that provide meals that meet the updated nutritional guidelines requirements. This bonus is not provided for breakfast, but funds may be used to support schools' breakfast programs. NSLP lunch reimbursement rates are listed in Table B -1 . In addition to federal cash subsidies, schools participating in NSLP receive USDA-acquired commodity food s . Schools are entitled to a specific, inflation-indexed value of USDA commodity foods for each lunch they serve. Also, schools may receive donations of bonus commodities acquired by USDA in support of the farm economy. In FY2017, the value of federal commodity food aid to schools totaled nearly $1.4 billion. The per-meal rate for commodity food assistance is included in Table B-4 . While the vast majority of NSLP funding is for lunches served during the school day, NSLP may also be used to support snack service during the school year and to serve meals during the summer. These features are discussed in subsequent sections, "" Summer Meals "" and "" After-School Meals and Snacks: CACFP, NSLP Options ."" Reimbursement rates for snacks are listed in Table B -2 . The School Breakfast Program (SBP) provides per-meal cash subsidies for breakfasts served in schools. Participating schools receive subsidies based on their status as a severe need or nonsevere need institution. Schools can qualify as a severe need school if 40% or more of their lunches are served free or at reduced prices. See Table B -3 for SBP reimbursement rates. Figure 4 displays SBP participation data for FY2017. In that year, SBP subsidized over 2.4 billion breakfasts in over 88,000 schools and nearly 3,200 RCCIs. Average daily participation was 14.7 million children (30.1% of the students enrolled in participating schools and RCCIs). The majority of meals served through SBP are free or reduced-price. Of the participating students, 79.1% (11.6 million) received free meals and 5.7% (835,000) purchased reduced-price meals. Federal school breakfast costs for the fiscal year totaled approximately $4.3 billion (see Table 3 for the various components of this total). Significantly fewer schools and students participate in SBP than in NSLP. Participation in SBP tends to be lower for several reasons, including the traditionally required early arrival by students in order to receive a meal and eat before school starts. Some schools offer (and anti-hunger groups have encouraged) models of breakfast service that can result in greater SBP participation, such as Breakfast in the Classroom, where meals are delivered in the classroom; ""grab and go"" carts, where students receive a bagged breakfast that they bring to class, or serving breakfast later in the day in middle and high schools. Unlike NSLP, commodity food assistance is not a formal part of SBP funding; however, commodities provided through NSLP may be used for school breakfasts as well. In addition to the school meals programs discussed above, other federal child nutrition programs provide federal subsidies and commodity food assistance for schools and other institutions that offer meals and snacks to children in early childhood, summer, and after-school settings. This assistance is provided to (1) schools and other governmental institutions, (2) private for-profit and nonprofit child care centers, (3) family/group day care homes, and (4) nongovernmental institutions/organizations that offer outside-of-school programs for children. (Although this report focuses on the programs that serve children, one child nutrition program (CACFP) also serves day care centers for chronically impaired adults and elderly persons under the same general per-meal/snack subsidy terms.) The programs in the sections to follow serve comparatively fewer children and spend comparatively fewer federal funds than the school meal programs. CACFP subsidizes meals and snacks served in early childhood, day care, and after-school settings. CACFP provides subsidies for meals and snacks served at participating nonresidential child care centers, family day care homes, and (to a lesser extent) adult day care centers. The program also provides assistance for meals served at after-school programs. CACFP reimbursements are available for meals and snacks served to children age 12 or under, migrant children age 15 or under, children with disabilities of any age, and, in the case of adult care centers, chronically impaired and elderly adults. Children in early childhood settings are the overwhelming majority of those served by the program. CACFP provides federal reimbursements for breakfasts, lunches, suppers, and snacks served in participating centers (facilities or institutions) or day care homes (private homes). The eligibility and funding rules for CACFP meals and snacks depend first on whether the participating institution is a center or a day care home (the next two sections discuss the rules specific to centers and day care homes). According to FY2017 CACFP data, child care centers have an average daily attendance of about 56 children per center, day care homes have an average daily attendance of approximately 7 children per home, and adult day care centers typically care for an average of 48 chronically ill or elderly adults per center. Providers must demonstrate that they comply with government-established standards for other child care programs. Like in school meals, federal assistance is made up overwhelmingly of cash reimbursements calculated based on the number of meals/snacks served and federal per-meal/snack reimbursements rates, but a far smaller share of federal aid (4.3% in FY2017) is in the form of federal USDA commodity foods (or cash in lieu of foods). Federal CACFP reimbursements flow to individual providers either directly from the administering state agency (this is the case with many child/adult care centers able to handle their own CACFP administrative functions) or through ""sponsors"" who oversee and provide administrative support for a number of local providers (this is the case with some child/adult care centers and with all day care homes). In FY2017, total CACFP spending was over $3.5 billion, including cash reimbursement, commodity food assistance, and costs for sponsor audits. (See Table 3 for a further breakdown of CACFP costs.) This total also includes the after-school meals and snacks provided through CACFP's ""at-risk after-school"" pathway; this aspect of the program is discussed later in "" After-School Meals and Snacks: CACFP, NSLP Options ."" As with school foods, the HHFKA required USDA to update CACFP's meal patterns. USDA's final rule revised the meal patterns for both meals served in child care centers and day care homes, as well as preschool meals served through the NSLP and SBP, effective October 1, 2017. For infants (under 12 months of age), the new meal patterns eliminated juice, supported breastfeeding, and set guidelines for the introduction of solid foods, among other changes. For children ages one and older, the new meal patterns increased whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and low-fat and fat-free milk; limited sugar in cereals and yogurts; and prohibited frying, among other requirements. Child care centers in CACFP can be (1) public or private nonprofit centers, (2) Head Start centers, (3) for-profit proprietary centers (if they meet certain requirements as to the proportion of low-income children they enroll), and (4) shelters for homeless families. Adult day care centers include public or private nonprofit centers and for-profit proprietary centers (if they meet minimum requirements related to serving low-income disabled and elderly adults). In FY2017, over 65,000 child care centers with an average daily attendance of over 3.6 million children participated in CACFP. Over 2,700 adult care centers served nearly 132,000 adults through CACFP. Participating centers may receive daily reimbursements for up to either two meals and one snack or one meal and two snacks for each participant, so long as the meals and snacks meet federal nutrition standards. The eligibility rules for CACFP centers largely track those of NSLP: children in households at or below 130% of the current poverty line qualify for free meals/snacks while those between 130% and 185% of poverty qualify for reduced-price meals/snacks (see Table 2 ). In addition, participation in the same categorical eligibility programs as NSLP as well as foster child status convey eligibility for free meals in CACFP. Like school meals, eligibility is determined through paper applications or direct certification processes. Like school meals, all meals and snacks served in the centers are federally subsidized to some degree, even those that are paid. Different reimbursement amounts are provided for breakfasts, lunches/suppers, and snacks, and reimbursement rates are set in law and indexed for inflation annually. The largest subsidies are paid for meals and snacks served to participants with family income below 130% of the federal poverty income guidelines (the income limit for free school meals), and the smallest to those who have not met a means test. See Table B -5 for current CACFP center reimbursement rates. Unlike school meals, CACFP institutions are less likely to collect per-meal payments. Although federal assistance for day care centers differentiates by household income, centers have discretion on their pricing of meals. Centers may adjust their regular fees (tuition) to account for federal payments, but CACFP itself does not regulate these fees. In addition, centers can charge families separately for meals/snacks, so long as there are no charges for children meeting free-meal/snack income tests and limited charges for those meeting reduced-price income tests. Independent centers are those without sponsors handling administrative responsibilities. These centers must pay for administrative costs associated with CACFP out of nonfederal funds or a portion of their meal subsidy payments. For centers with sponsors, the sponsors may retain a proportion of the meal reimbursement payments they receive on behalf of their centers to cover such costs. CACFP-supported day care homes serve a smaller number of children than CACFP-supported centers , both in terms of the total number of children served and the average number of children per facility. Roughly 17% of children in CACFP (approximately 757,000 in FY2017 average daily attendance) are served through day care homes. In FY2017, approximately 103,000 homes (with just over 700 sponsors) received CACFP support. As with centers, payments to day care homes are provided for up to either two meals and one snack or one meal and two snacks a day for each child. Unlike centers, day care homes must participate under the auspices of a public or, more often, private nonprofit sponsor that typically has 100 or more homes under its supervision. CACFP day care home sponsors receive monthly administrative payments based on the number of homes for which they are responsible. Federal reimbursements for family day care homes differ by the home's status as ""Tier I"" or ""Tier II."" Unlike centers, day care homes receive cash reimbursements (but not commodity foods) that generally are not based on the child participants' household income. Instead, there are two distinct, annually indexed reimbursement rates that are based on area or operator eligibility criteria Tier I homes are located in low-income areas (defined as areas in which at least 50% of school-age and enrolled children qualify for free or reduced-price meals) or operated by low-income providers whose household income meets the free or reduced-price income standards. They receive higher subsidies for each meal/snack they serve. Tier II (lower) rates are by default those for homes that do not qualify for Tier I rates; however, Tier II providers may seek the higher Tier I subsidy rates for individual low-income children for whom financial information is collected and verified. (See Table B-6 for current Tier I and Tier II reimbursement rates.) Additionally, HHFKA introduced a number of additional ways (as compared to prior law) by which family day care homes can qualify as low-income and get Tier I rates for the entire home or for individual children. As with centers, there is no requirement that meals/snacks specifically identified as free or reduced-price be offered; however, unlike centers, federal rules prohibit any separate meal charges. Current law SFSP and the NSLP/SBP Seamless Summer Option provide meals in congregate settings nationwide; the related Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer (SEBTC or Summer EBT) demonstration project is an alternative to congregate settings. SFSP supports meals for children during the summer months. The program provides assistance to local public institutions and private nonprofit service institutions running summer youth/recreation programs, summer feeding projects, and camps. Assistance is primarily in the form of cash reimbursements for each meal or snack served; however, federally donated commodity foods are also offered. Participating service institutions are often entities that provide ongoing year-round service to the community including schools, local governments, camps, colleges and universities in the National Youth Sports program, and private nonprofit organizations like churches. Similar to the CACFP model, sponsors are institutions that manage the food preparation, financial, and administrative responsibilities of SFSP. Sites are the places where food is served and eaten. At times, a sponsor may also be a site. State agencies authorize sponsors, monitor and inspect sponsors and sites, and implement USDA policy. Unlike CACFP, sponsors are required for an institution's participation in SFSP as a site. In FY2017, nearly 5,500 sponsors with 50,000 food service sites participated in the SFSP and served an average of approximately 2.7 million children daily (according to July data). Participation of sites and children in SFSP has increased in recent years. Program costs for FY2017 totaled over $485 million, including cash assistance, commodity foods, administrative cost assistance, and health inspection costs. There are several options for eligibility and meal/snack service for SFSP sponsors (and their sites) Open sites provide summer food to all children in the community. These sites are certified based on area eligibility measures, where 50% or more of area children have family income that would make them eligible for free or reduced-price school meals (see Table 2 ). Closed or Enrolled sites provide summer meals/snacks free to all children enrolled at the site. The eligibility test for these sites is that 50% or more of the children enrolled in the sponsor's program must be eligible for free or reduced-price school meals based on household income. Closed/enrolled sites may also become eligible based on area eligibility measures noted above. Summer camps (that are not enrolled sites) receive subsidies only for those children with household eligibility for free or reduced-price school meals. Other programs specified in law , such as the National Youth Sports Program and centers for homeless or migrant children. Summer sponsors get operating cost (food, storage, labor) subsidies for all meals/snacks they serve—up to one meal and one snack, or two meals per child per day. In addition, sponsors receive payments for administrative costs, and states are provided with subsidies for administrative costs and health and meal-quality inspections. See Table B -7 for current SFSP reimbursement rates. Actual payments vary slightly (e.g., by about 5 cents for lunches) depending on the location of the site (e.g., rural vs. urban) and whether meals are prepared on-site or by a vendor. Although SFSP is the child nutrition program most associated with providing meals during summer months, it is not the only program option for providing these meals and snacks. The Seamless Summer Option, run through NSLP or SBP programs, is also a means through which food can be provided to students during summer months. Much like SFSP, Seamless Summer operates in summer sites (summer camps, sports programs, churches, private nonprofit organizations, etc.) and for a similar duration of time. Unlike SFSP, schools are the only eligible sponsors , although schools may operate the program at other sites. Reimbursement rates for Seamless Summer meals are the same as current NSLP/SBP rates. Beginning in summer 2011 and (as of the date of this report) each summer since, USDA-FNS has operated Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children (SEBTC or ""Summer EBT"") demonstration projects in a limited number of states and Indian Tribal Organizations (ITOs). These Summer EBT projects provide electronic food benefits over summer months to households with children eligible for free or reduced-price school meals. Depending on the site and year, either $30 or $60 per month is provided, through a WIC or SNAP EBT card model. In the demonstration projects, these benefits were provided as a supplement to the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) meals available in congregate settings. Summer EBT and other alternatives to congregate meals through SFSP were first authorized and funded by the FY2010 appropriations law ( P.L. 111-80 ). Although a number of alternatives were tested and evaluated, findings from Summer EBT were among the most promising, and Congress provided subsequent funding. Summer EBT evaluations showed significant impacts on reducing child food insecurity and improving nutritional intake.  Summer EBT was funded by P.L. 111-80 in the summers from 2011 to 2014. Projects have continued to operate and were annually funded by FY2015-FY2018 appropriations; most recently, the FY2018 appropriations law ( P.L. 115-141 ) provided $28 million. According to USDA-FNS, in summer 2016 Summer EBT served over 209,000 children in nine states and two tribal nations—an increase from the 11,400 children served when the demonstration began in summer 2011. Schools (and institutions like summer camps and child care facilities) that are not already participating in the other child nutrition programs can participate in the Special Milk Program. Schools may also administer SMP for their part-day sessions for kindergartners or pre-kindergartners. Under SMP, participating institutions provide milk to children for free and/or at a subsidized paid price, depending on how the enrolled institution opts to administer the program (see Table B -8 for current Special Milk reimbursement rates for each of these options) An institution that only sells milk will receive the same per-half pint federal reimbursement for each milk sold (approximately 20 cents). An institution that sells milk and provides free milk to eligible children (income eligibility is the same as free school meals, see Table 2 ), receives a reimbursement for the milk sold (approximately 20 cents) and a higher reimbursement for the free milks. An institution that does not sell milk provides milk free to all children and receives the same reimbursement for all milk (approximately 20 cents). This option is sometimes called nonpricing. In FY2017, over 41 million half-pints were subsidized, 9.5% of which were served free. Federal expenditures for this program were approximately $8.3 million in FY2017. States receive formula grants through the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, under which state-selected schools receive funds to purchase and distribute fresh fruit and vegetable snacks to all children in attendance (regardless of family income). Money is distributed by a formula under which about half the funding is distributed equally to each state and the remainder is allocated by state population. States select participating schools (with an emphasis on those with a higher proportion of low-income children) and set annual per-student grant amounts (between $50 and $75). Funding is set by law at $150 million for school year 2011-2012 and inflation-indexed for every year after. In FY2017, states used approximately $184 million in FFVP funds. FFVP is funded by a mandatory transfer of funds from USDA's Section 32 program—a permanent appropriation of 30% of the previous year's customs receipts. This transfer is required by FFVP's authorizing laws (Section 19 of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act and Section 4304 of P.L. 110-246 ). Up until FY2018's law, annual appropriations laws delayed a portion of the funds to the next fiscal year. After a pilot period, the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-265 ) permanently authorized and funded FFVP for a limited number of states and Indian reservations. In recent years, FFVP has been amended by omnibus farm bill laws rather than through child nutrition reauthorizations. The 2008 farm bill ( P.L. 110-246 ) expanded FFVP's mandatory funding, specifically providing funds through Section 32, and enabled all states to participate in the program. The 2014 farm bill ( P.L. 113-79 ) essentially made no changes to this program but did include, and fund at $5 million in FY2014, a pilot project that requires USDA to test offering frozen, dried, and canned fruits and vegetables and publish an evaluation of the pilot. Four states (Alaska, Delaware, Kansas, and Maine) participated in the pilot in SY2014-2015 and the evaluation was published in 2017. Other proposals to expand fruits and vegetables offered in FFVP have been introduced in both the 114 th and 115 th Congress. Two of the child nutrition programs discussed in previous sections, the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), provide federal support for snacks and meals served during after-school programs. NSLP provides reimbursements for after-school snacks; however, this option is open only to schools that already participate in NSLP. These schools may operate after-school snack-only programs during the school year, and can do so in two ways: (1) if low-income area eligibility criteria are met, provide free snacks in lower-income areas; or (2) if area eligibility criteria are not met, offer free, reduced-price, or fully paid-for snacks, based on household income eligibility (like lunches in NSLP). The vast majority of snacks provided through this program are through the first option. Through this program, approximately 206 million snacks were served in FY2017 (a daily average of nearly 1.3 million). This compares with nearly 4.9 billion lunches served (a daily average of 27.8 million). CACFP provides assistance for after-school food in two ways. First, centers and homes that participate in CACFP and provide after-school care may participate in traditional CACFP (the eligibility and administration described earlier). Second, centers in areas where at least half the children in the community are eligible for free or reduced-price school meals can opt to participate in the CACFP At-Risk Afterschool program, which provides free snacks and suppers. Expansion of the At-Risk After-School meals program was a major policy change included in HHFKA. Prior to the law, 13 states were permitted to offer CACFP At-Risk After-School meals (instead of just a snack); the law allowed all CACFP state agencies to offer such meals. In FY2017, the At-Risk Afterschool program served a total of approximately 242.6 million free meals and snacks to a daily average of more than 1.7 million children. Federal child nutrition laws authorize and program funding supports a range of additional programs, initiatives, and activities. Through State Administrative Expenses funding, states are entitled to federal grants to help cover administrative and oversight/monitoring costs associated with child nutrition programs. The national amount each year is equal to about 2% of child nutrition reimbursements. The majority of this money is allocated to states based on their share of spending on the covered programs; about 15% is allocated under a discretionary formula granting each state additional amounts for CACFP, commodity distribution, and Administrative Review efforts. In addition, states receive payments for their role in overseeing summer programs (about 2.5% of their summer program aid). States are free to apportion their federal administrative expense payments among child nutrition initiatives (including commodity distribution activities) as they see fit, and appropriated funding is available to states for two years. State Administrative Expense spending in FY2017 totaled approximately $279 million. Team Nutrition is a USDA-FNS program that includes a variety of school meals initiatives around nutrition education and the nutritional content of the foods children eat in schools. This includes Team Nutrition Training Grants, which provide funding to state agencies for training and technical assistance, such as help implementing USDA's nutrition requirements and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. From 2004 to 2018, Team Nutrition also included the HealthierUS Schools Challenge (HUSSC), which originated in the 2004 reauthorization of the Child Nutrition Act. HUSSC was a voluntary certification initiative designed to recognize schools that have created a healthy school environment through the promotion of nutrition and physical activity. Farm-to-school programs broadly refer to ""efforts that bring regionally and locally produced foods into school cafeterias,"" with a focus on enhancing child nutrition. The goals of these efforts include increasing fruit and vegetable consumption among students, supporting local farmers and rural communities, and providing nutrition and agriculture education to school districts and farmers. HHFKA amended existing child nutrition programs to establish mandatory funding of $5 million per year for competitive farm-to-school grants that support schools and nonprofit entities in establishing farm-to-school programs that improve a school's access to locally produced foods. The FY2018 appropriations law provided an additional $5 million in discretionary funding to remain available until expended. Grants may be used for training, supporting operations, planning, purchasing equipment, developing school gardens, developing partnerships, and implementing farm-to-school programs. USDA's Office of Community Food Systems provides additional resources on farm-to-school issues. Through an Administrative Review process (formerly referred to as Coordinated Review Effort (CRE)), USDA-FNS, in cooperation with state agencies, conducts periodic on-site NSLP school compliance and accountability evaluations to improve management and identify administrative, subsidy claim, and meal quality problems. State agencies are required to conduct administrative reviews of all school food authorities (SFAs) that operate the NSLP under their jurisdiction at least once during a three-year review cycle. Federal Administrative Review expenditures were approximately $9.9 million in FY2017. USDA-FNS and state agencies conduct many other child nutrition program support activities for which dedicated funding is provided. Among other examples, there is the Institute of Child Nutrition (ICN), which provides technical assistance, instruction, and materials related to nutrition and food service management; it receives $5 million a year in mandatory funding appropriated in statute. ICN is located at the University of Mississippi. USDA-FNS provides training on food safety education. Funding is also provided for USDA-FNS to conduct studies, provide training and technical assistance, and oversee payment accuracy. Appendix A. Acronyms Used in This Report Appendix B. Per-meal or Per-snack Reimbursement Rates for Child Nutrition Programs This appendix lists the specific reimbursement rates discussed in the earlier sections of the report. Reimbursement rates are adjusted for inflation for each school or calendar year according to terms laid out in the programs' authorizing laws. Each year, the new rates are announced in the Federal Register . \n\n","['The ""child nutrition programs"" refer to the U.S. Department of Agriculture\'s Food and Nutrition Service (USDA-FNS) programs that provide food for children in school or institutional settings. The best known programs, which serve the largest number of children, are the school meals programs: the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and the School Breakfast Program (SBP). The child nutrition programs also include the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), which provides meals and snacks in day care and after school settings; the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), which provides food during the summer months; the Special Milk Program (SMP), which supports milk for schools that do not participate in NSLP or SBP; and the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP), which funds fruit and vegetable snacks in select elementary schools. Funding: The vast majority of the child nutrition programs account is considered mandatory spending, with trace amounts of discretionary funding for certain related activities. Referred to as open-ended, ""appropriated entitlements,"" funding is provided through the annual appropriations process; however, the level of spending is controlled by benefit and eligibility criteria in federal law and dependent on the resulting levels of participation. Federal cash funding (in the form of per-meal reimbursements) and USDA commodity food support is guaranteed to schools and other providers based on the number of meals or snacks served and participant category (e.g., free meals for poor children get higher subsidies). Participation: The child nutrition programs serve children of varying ages and in different institutional settings. The NSLP and SBP have the broadest reach, serving qualifying children of all ages in school settings. Other child nutrition programs serve more-narrow populations. CACFP, for example, provides meals and snacks to children in early childhood and after-school settings among other venues. Programs generally provide some subsidy for all food served but a larger federal reimbursement for food served to children from low-income households. Administration: Responsibility for child nutrition programs is divided between the federal government, states, and localities. The state agency and type of local provider differs by program. In the NSLP and SBP, schools and school districts (""school food authorities"") administer the program. Meanwhile, SFSP (and sometimes CACFP) uses a model in which sponsor organizations handle administrative responsibilities for a number of sites that serve meals. Reauthorization: The underlying laws covering the child nutrition programs were last reauthorized in the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA, P.L. 111-296, enacted December 13, 2010). This law made significant changes to child nutrition programs, including increasing federal financing for school lunches, expanding access to community eligibility and direct certification options for schools, and expanding eligibility options for home child care providers. The law also required an update to school meal nutrition guidelines as well as new guidelines for food served outside the meal programs (e.g., snacks sold in vending machines and cafeteria a la carte lines). Current Issues: The 114th Congress began but did not complete a 2016 child nutrition reauthorization, and there was no significant legislative activity with regard to reauthorization in the 115th Congress. However, the vast majority of operations and activities continue with funding provided by appropriations laws. Current issues in the child nutrition programs are discussed in CRS Report R45486, Child Nutrition Programs: Current Issues.']","8317","gov_report","en","None","cbeec70bcfb72047d4e6c61220081a119adaa31560983e53","Summary:","gov_report","532","\n\nThe federal child nutrition programs in the United States play a crucial role in providing assistance in the provision of meals and snacks to children in various institutions such as schools, child care centers, and summer programs.
